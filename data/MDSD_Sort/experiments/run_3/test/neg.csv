    I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.  At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was "okay to be gay", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly. I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.  Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life... 
 It appears that the thesis of this book is that logical organization and structure in the laws of physics only goes so far down, that you reach a certain level where the nature of reality is intrinsically opaque and that even in principle there can be no further explanations, that things just are the way they are.  Further, at this level of opacity, the "givens" are very messy and arbitrary: there is no elegance, simplicity, and beauty, the heretofore goals of scientific theories. Instead, at bottom the universe we live in is a Rube Goldberg concoction of surpassing inelegance.  At this point, the author, Leonard Susskind, says there are two possibilities:  1. There is only one universe, the one we live in. In that case, these messy, seemingly arbitrary laws and constants of the universe must be deliberately designed to allow the development of intelligent creatures like us human beings. This follows the so-called "strong" anthropic principle: our very existence proves there is an Intelligence Designer behind all of existence.  2. There are unending possibilities in the laws and constants of nature and our universe is just one possibility. There is a "megaverse" that continuously spawns "pocket universes," each of which has a random set of laws and constants, and our universe is just one of these countless numbers.   How can we make a purely scientific decision between these two views? Until recently, a lot of physicists hoped that String Theory would be found to support the first scenario: there would be a single solution to the equations that would produce the particular laws and constants we find in our universe. This seemingly arbitrary and messy collection of too many constants and laws would actually flow from a tiny set of first principles that would appear to be inevitable. This would also get around the "need" for an Intelligent Designer. The universe would be the way it is because it has to be that way.  But, alas, the most recent developments of String Theory seem to be pushing in the opposite direction: String Theory seems to allow for an unimaginably large set of possible sets of laws and constants: ten to the five-hundredth power in fact! Among all those possibilities, one or more like our own universe would arise purely by chance, and once again there wouldn't be anything mysterious or supernatural about our existence.  Thus, Susskind triumphantly disposes of the need of a supernatural basis for existence no matter what, and if this book has any focus at all this conclusion seems to be it.  The attitude that is convinced by this kind of reasoning is called scientific materialism. It is commonly used in popular science books by atheistic authors. Now there is nothing wrong with trying to explain phenomena "all the way down," without bringing supernatural causes and "miracles" into the picture. That's what the business of science is, and we should always be suspect when the miraculous is used to fill in "gaps" that science is unable (at the moment) to fill (most often these reputed gaps are merely wishful thinking on the part of religious fundamentalists anyhow, especially when it comes to "disbelief" in evolution). But to conclude that there is no transcendent ground to existence just because we have scientific explanations for something "all the way down" is overstepping the bounds of science proper into scientific materialism, and that is the fatal flaw of this book and is a major reason for me downgrading it to two stars.  Just because a God may not be self-consciously involved in the selection of the most fundamental laws of nature in our pocket universe doesn't mean that it doesn't take the infinite depths of a God behind everything to provide "room" in the potentialities of existence for life as we know it to arise. The very fact that it is possible for something like the human mind to arise from the apparently "dead" material of existence speaks to a transcendent nature that is behind it all.  This is the point that everyone seems to miss who preaches like Susskind that because at bottom it is only a matter of chance that our universe has the laws that it has, there is no "need" for God. The very fact that human experience is possible, even with our laws at bottom the result of sheer chance among 10**500 other possibilities, this very fact requires there to be an infinite Presence that some like to call God. It is God's bottomless nature that allows such highly improbable universes as ours to come into existence in the first place. God doesn't need to bring any universes into existence consciously; he does it by his very nature, and most of them pop in an out of existence without God even being consciously aware of them: it's just something God does without having to think about it. But without this infinite nature, none of us would ever appear in any highly improbable, anthropic universe, because the potential would not be there.   Maybe a conscious God is not needed to produce bacteria. Maybe a conscious God is not needed to produce 10**500 universes for every one like ours. But God is a prerequisite for universes like ours even to appear. The miracle is that there is "room" for a universe like ours to exist. God doesn't need to concern himself with the overwhelming preponderance of abortive pocket universes that pop in and out of existence. The spark of his consciousness needs only to spring alive when a universe like ours happens along by sheer chance. Then he can take an interest and start persuading consciousness when it begins to arise to flow in certain directions, towards his own unlimited possibilities in depth and beauty. God then acts like a lure, drawing consciousness into his own explosive depths, and who knows how far evolution can then proceed, once the conscious God takes hold of it.  In presenting this "theistic" view of reality, I'm really doing no more than the same sort of thing that Susskind is doing, and that's the flaw of this book. I'm not presenting science, but Susskind is using the name of science to present an atheistic view contrary to theistic views that irritate him. All I'm saying is that his atheistic views are easily countered by alternative theistic views. In either case, those views are only going to be persuasive to those with corresponding spiritual experiences of the world. As for the science that Susskind does describe in his book, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, it has been far better explained by other authors such as Brian Greene. I was frankly bored silly by the last half of Susskind's book, whereas Brian Greene is fascinating throughout. 
 I loved What The Bleep? And I specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day'.  This video teaches NOTHING about how to create your day - NOTHING.  It's just Ramtha (JZ Knight) talking about the fact that you can create your day.  I HEARD YOU IN THE MOVIE!  I bought this to give me some additional insights into HOW to create my day.  It does NOT teach any HOW whatsoever.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!  Buy "The Secret" @ TheSecret.tv.  Buy "The Attractor Factor" by Joe Vitale.  Buy "Wealth Beyond Reason" by Bob Doyle.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO 
 I don't know how it happened.  Whether he was threatened, bribed, or just accepted a super offer from the dark side.  However it happened, this guy has lost his way.  I love Power vs Force, but I think its probably a good idea to take what this guy says fron now on with the proverbial grain of salt 
 I would not buy it!  Hard to use. My machine runs slower since the install.  
 There is one word to describe Ayaan Hirsi Ali's work: Rubbish or for the American audience that would translate into "Garbage."  Please excuse my lack of creativity and eloquence in tailoring an adequate response that may cater to the aristocrats out there.  Here is a recipe to quick fame:  Every John Doe writes a book bashing Islam and instantly shoots to fame but moreover by writing a book is considered by the Western media to be an "expert" in that particular field of study - this is a mockery of the institutionalized form of intellectual discourse.  Ayaan Hirsi has had some hardships in his life and is blaming Islam at their expense.  He is not a scholar nor does he understand what Islam stands for.  In fact this doesn't even deserve my 1 star rating.  Had there been an option for "0 stars" that would have been more suitable.  As for my own credibility, though I'm not a scholar, I happen to be in the "academic circle" so-to-speak.  Oh, one last thing, I happen to go to an Ivy League School too (not trying to brag but just shedding light on my background).  I recommend reading Martin Lings book on the biography on the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).  This book is entitled "Muhammad" by Martin Lings.  You will certainly gain a lot more by reading that than this load of gibberish.  Other good books are by authors like Karen Armstrong.  
 I happened on this book while just browsing in a bookstore and because I have enjoyed Cornwell's writing in the past, bought it without reading any reviews.  I have learned my lesson.  I was totally disappointed and felt that the story had absolutely no depth and was poorly written.  She (Cornwell) would have been better off to trash this one, as I am sure that this book will give many of her fans a real cause to pause before buying another of her books. A real waste of time and money. 
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 Lou Reed is my favourite musician bar none, however his solo career has been somewhat variable. This recording is one of the more difficult moments in his canon. The range of musical styles and guest artists leads to a lack of cohesion, rather than generate interest it only serves to momentarily mask the generally poor writing on offer here.   This is not to say the work has no merit, the reading of an updated 'The Raven' is strangely riveting, 'Burning Embers' seethes with demented machismo and the second track introduces its subject with real energy. Some of the more contemplative moments also work well, 'Call On Me' is simple and sweet with a lovely guest vocal from wife Laurie Anderson, 'Vanishing Act' is hypnotic and possibly the strongest cut on the record and 'Guardian Angel' closes the set off on an appropriately philosophical note. 'Who Am I?' is the only song that could be deemed accessible, although with just a tiny bit more restraint it could have been a career highlight.   So what brings the work down. Firstly, the inclusion of two arbitrary and, frankly, crappy versions of earlier Reed songs-'The Bed' and 'Perfect Day', hearing the latter murdered by the self-conscious falsetto of Antony is a particularly gruelling experience. The brief poetic interludes also fail to come off well, they might be art but they certainly ain't fun on repeated listening. Many guests appear on gimmicky songs that only further cloud this tribute- 'Balloon' and 'Broadway Song' both lose their charm quickly. Fortunately, both David Bowie and the Blind Boys of Alabama do a good job.   Reed's earlier tribute "Songs for Drella" occassionally hit a wrong note but not as often as here, listeners wanting to here Reed is a more musically friendly mode...without sacrificing the artiness or intelligence need not look back too far. Try 2000s far superior "Ecstasy".     
 I haven't read a Picoult book in a while because her formula was bothering me but I saw this in the airport and decided it would be a easy yet entertaining read for the tedious 3 hour journey.  It was entertaining to the extent that I finished it. Unfortunately - it was still formulaic and completely predictable.  Elements that I liked:   - Rape is very rarely easy to sort out and date rape cases involving drugs, ex-boyfriends and alcohol are especially difficult. The confusion and obfuscation that Picoult writes (whether that was her intention or just poor writing) surrounding the issue can be representative of an actual rape.    - Teenagers are notoriously melodramatic and self pitying and Trixie, though a little over the top, seemed like a typical teenager... the reaction of other students at her school to the rape and Trixie also seem plausible.   - I liked the graphic novel. The melodramatic aspects are typical of the genre and it was a great way to try and illustrate Daniel. The hidden word bit - hokey.   - I liked learning about the native cultures in Alaska. I would like to read a whole book that takes place there and explores the themes though maybe not by Picoult.   - I liked the idiot's guide to Dante that was incorporated into the book.  Things I didn't like:   - Picoult tries to incorporate too much into this book and thus wasn't able to fully develop it all. Though I liked the native Alaskan bit, it was too jumbled and it didn't really add to the plot. Like another reviewer I wasn't left with the impression that Daniel's haunted past resurfaced. I was expecting a lot more. Murder? That's too much to add to this already overburdened plot.   We lose threads here and there like Daniel's career and the wife's affair - he just disappears after his admission. Cutting is a very real phenomena for many young women and Jodi doesn't explain or develop it.  I don't know that it was at all believable. Could the myopic Trixie have had the wherewithal to make it to Alaska when she could barely see beyond her own break-up and tried to commit suicide multiple times?  The cop, the DNA analyst, the lawyers, the parents, the twist - I've seen them all before in Jodi's other books... it's part of her formula.  I wonder what would happen if Jodi spent maybe three or four years researching a novel and devoting time to its plot. She could excel in character development and careful analysis of difficult topics. I feel like this novel writing machine is doing herself, her readers and literature a disservice 
 The author Feiler wrongly ignores (or honestly doesn't realize) that the Holy Bible claims mountains of Ararat to be where Noah's Ark landed. Not Mt. Ararat itself. In the early Christian era (long after the Old Testament was written down) Mt. Ararat was known instead as Masis Mons or Mt. Masis. The people of the early biblical writers's time all felt the Ararat region where the ark landed was far south of where Mt. Ararat is. There are many mountains that have traditions of being the mountain of Noah's Ark.    Feiler also refers to WW1 Russian pilots spotting something resembling the ark on ararat. This story is rather fictional. It was pretty much created by one writer Benjamin Allen in 1940 for a magazine. Roscovitski was the name of the pilot that Allen invented to have seen the ark. Read books from your library by Prof. Lloyd Bailey on the real possible locations of Noah's Ark 
 Denise Austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults. This video isn't kid friendly, and doesn't have a good feel for kids. To be honest, it is very close to most of Denise's exercise videos for adults. What Denise has forgotten, or may have never known, is kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly, and that means with exercise videos to. A good choice for kids is - Kick to Get Fit Jr. -For Kids, this video is done by a qualified kid's fitness professional, not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids, and just hoping they can do them. My kids are NOT at all happy with this program.  There are 6 & 10 years old, and they were bored & turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes, mostly because they didn't understand the movements, and then found most of the other movements very hard to do. Once again, the forgotten point - Kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly. One last point, in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children's exercise & fitness. This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,-  You MUST be able to teach & instruct children at a level they understand. Just because you know something about exercise, it doesn't mean you are able to teach it to children. Knowledge is one thing - Teaching & Instructing is another, and the fact is, some people are just not very good at instructing children. A point that is very clearly displayed within this program. 
 THE BASE is an overall average film. Clearly the actors' talents are not put to full use. Mark Dacascos' excellent martial arts skills are supressed to appear like a good street fighter, not the impressive military weapon he is suppose to portray. The story line is interesting, but is weakened by the poor ending of this action film. The good guy wins, but it is a dismal victory. The nudity added to The Base does not really flow with the story line. The director clearly failed in this film. The acting in this film is very good, but the camera angles were not. I'm sure the actors were disappointed with the final product. THE BASE is worth seeing once. I suggest renting versus buying 
 Outside of "Memnoch the Devil," this is the worst vampire novel written by Rice.  It's basically homo erotica in the guise of a vampire story.  It single handedly ruined the image of Armand I had (not that Rice had to write to my expectations!). Not only is it filled with homo erotica, it's filled with pedophilia.  This ruined Marius for me, too.  He's basically a child predator.  He educates young boys in his home, where he and Armand begin to have a love affair.  It's really full of deviant sexual imagery, and as I've mentioned before, what is Rice's obsession with male sexuality?  There are never any depictions of lesbianism (that I remember), just extreme examples of gay, male sex, including Marius (a man) and Armand (a boy).  It's revolting to read.  Would women like to read about an older women preying on young girls?  Her writing about men is twisted and severely distorted.  If you take out all of this deviance, the book has some beautiful descriptions of the settings in which the story takes place.  This and the origins of Armand, are the sole redeeming values of this novel - and it's not quite so full of religious tripe as latter novels.  My advice is skip this and read other novels by her, except "Memnoch the Devil," which is even worse than this novel 
 This book was published in 1995 (so of course was written in about 1993-94) so its information is very out of date. Since that time technology has introduced the BMD bone density scan, and the pharmaceutical industry has developed and promoted the use of bisphosphonates such as Fosamax and Evista. These two developments alone have rendered this book totally out of date and therefore not useful, in my opinion. Also, the information is not evidence-based, most of his recommendations are based on anecdotal and observed results, rather than on scientific studies. What he has to say is interesting, sometimes even fascinating, but is it accurate? For example, his recommendations on caffeine are based on the result of an "experiment" of giving three cups of coffee to five women. I don't consider that evidence-based medical protocol.  A vastly better source of information is The Myth of Osteoporosis, by Gillian Sanson, published in 2003. Her book is exhaustively researched, she cites medical and research studies involving hundreds and thousands of subjects, she covers the newest technologies and medications. The only thing missing from her book (because it was published a few years ago) is the very latest information about the potential dangers of Fosamax and the class-action lawsuits about the death of bone in the jaw that has caused people to have their jaws removed.  She provides excellent suggestions for improving bone health, including exercise, dietary changes, supplements, and other ways to beat osteoporosis. She doesn't say that osteoporosis is a myth, she just debunks some of the myths surrounding this condition. I highly recommend this book over the Gaby book 
    As much as I loved the new characters in the book, I would have liked to have seen more of Darth Maul. There are often large gaps between his appearances. However, I realize it could be difficult to have him around all the time and keep it interesting. Maul can be a rather flat character if not used sparingly.   I also would have liked to have seen more background on Maul. Why does he hate the Jedi so much? How did he hook up with Sidious? What was his training like? Some is given on this, but not a lot. Most of that was told in the Darth Maul Journal, something many fans will probably not read. It should have been saved for this.   The timing of this book is also confusing. It takes place days, if not hours, before the Naboo blockade. The whole point of the novel is that the Sith don't want the Jedi to know about their existence or the blockade. However, just a couple of days later, they completely reveal themselves to the Jedi and their plans. If the events were so close to happening that they were almost unstoppable, why did they care if some little information broker tried to sell the info? If it had been months before, their concern would have been more understandable. The closeness in chronology kind of takes away from the urgency of the events in the book.   Final Thoughts:  Only read this book if you are a Darth Maul junkie.  If you read this book for any other reason, you will be let down.  Reading this book is not necessary to stay abreast of the Star Wars galaxy 
 I ordered this book after reading an excerpt from it somewhere else on-line.  I was interested in what she had to say about other women who were struggling with the work vs. family dilemma, as well as those who weren't "perfect PTA moms" who were perpetually happy.  I think perhaps the reason I found the book unsatisfying is that she tackles too many subjects in the book -- looking at women's life choices beginning in their twenties and going to retirement and beyond.  In many cases, she would introduce a subject whom she had interviewed, and a few pages later, would move on to someone else.  I found myself wanting MORE.    I also felt that, though the book is only 6 years old, it already feels dated.  She speaks about women who choose to be single parents as being in the vanguard of a new generation.  I think this may be less true nowadays, especially in the upper middle class world she describes.  She also talks about the 'betrayal' women feel who delay childbearing and then find out, too late, that they've left it for too long.  This also seems to be a nonissue these days, since the 'donor eggs' which she speaks about as a last resort, are perhaps more accepted these days as well.    That said, I would probably recommend this book to a younger woman, such as one in her twenties, just because it helps break down the idea that women's choices are black and white (work vs. family, marriage vs. career).  She shows that many people have many different paths, careers and even marriages in their lifetimes and that nothing is absolute.    
 I bought this book thinking that there was some secret "neural" or "linguistic" programming (like a certain set of instructions) I could follow to gain some sort of advantage in life, and what I got was just a lot of the same self-help stuff that seems to have been already covered by many others.  The "technology" is really just learning how to think of things differently; particularly negative things that drag you down.  There are also some ideas related to communications and establishing repoir with others that could come in handy.  That said, precious little in this book struck me as being "new".  And to add bewilderment to my dissappointment there were also two particularly logic defying ideas that form the foundation of this "technology".  First, "Every behavior is useful in some context".   Hmmm, this was written in 1994.  Did having a bunch of fanatics fly airliners into the World Trade Center maybe cause this presupposition to come into question?  Second, "If one person can do something, anyone can learn to do it."    That's right.  One person figured out that mass equals energy times the speed of light squared, and so anyone could learn to figure out the profound principles that govern our universe.  If one person can design a microprocessor chip, anyone can learn to.  If one person can compose a recording like "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts" or "Pet Sounds", then anyone can learn to.  If one person can carve a statue of David out of marble (who did that again?), anyone can learn to!  I could be a nuclear physicist, a computer engineering genious, a  classical music composer, an opera star, a nobel prize winning economist --you name it -- simply because someone else did!   Brilliant.   Well, I gotta cut this short because today I'm writing a bestselling novel, recording the next great love song, and designing an ion-propulsion engine for space travel.  After all, one person has done those things.  I can learn to do them too.   Seriously, I gave this book two stars instead of one because if the reader has geniunely never been introduced to some of the thought pattern changing techniques in this book, then he or she could actually benefit from reading it.  I could probably stand a little more "inner alignment" myself.   
 It's hard to complain about Mr. Tulloch's book, although that is what I will do, because it is really the only book on the topic. IIS 6.0 is a production tool, a 300-ton press as compared to a tack hammer. I suppose we're lucky Mr. Tulloch was inspired to write about it. We don't get many books about 300-ton presses.  I am a software application developer who moonlights as a manufacturing engineer, sometimes setting up punch presses. I earn my living by making things work. Mr. Tulloch's book is about how to keep things from working. Although he calls it "security" what he really means is "job security" in the sense that we used to say, "Nobody gets fired for buying from IBM." Only today plenty of people do get fired for doing just that.  Mr. Tulloch is delighted that IIS is delivered in "lockdown mode" while I am angry. That means people who operate as Mr. Tulloch recommends have little to do. Little can go wrong, because almost nothing can work. People like me have to figure out what is keeping their software from working and wheedle people like Mr. Tulloch to ease up.   Mr. Tulloch repeatedly says making that software actually work is "beyond the scope" of his book. Mr. Tulloch's approach is driving the United States and other industrial democracies into bankruptcy and making opportunities for people in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe who are still focused on making things work. 
 This book was advertised as though it would be valuable for any professional. This is absolutely not the case. This book covers very, very basic guidelines and does so in an overview type fashion. I would recommend this book for college graduates or those who are employed at entry level jobs and are seeking advancement 
 The Gypsy Game continues the adventures of April, Melanie, Elizabeth, Marshall, Toby and Ken first introduced by Snyder in The Egypt Game, which in my opinion was the better of the two books.  The kids feel that they've explored everything in Egypt so April suggests that they now play The Gypsy Game.  As the kids begin their research, Melanie is reluctant to play because of all the negative things she discovers, but the others are very keen especially Toby.  Toby is half gypsy on his father's side and shows his friends his grandmother's jewelry etc.  Toby's mother is deceased but her rich family, who never approved of her marriage, decides that they want to adopt Toby to continue the family name meaning they'd also change his full name.  He thinks that his father is in danger from them so he runs away.  His friends get involved and repair everything.  In the end, instead of playing The Gypsy Game they take up a neighborhood cause.  I wanted a story like The Egypt Game, where I could relive the wonder of childhood make believe; but this story was very different.  I hope Snyder writes more books about these kids on the same level as The Egypt Game.  This book just wasn't as good! 
 As other reviewers have noted, this product emits a light that is too dim for easy reading.  Also, the wavy pattern it produces is visually distracting.  LightWedge customer service will NEVER admit that anything might be wrong with their products or that individual customers might find their products unsatisfactory.  I recommend that you do not buy this book light.    
 I borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read. It is the first Barr book I have read.  I did not like it because of several reasons.  First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much.   One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter.   Second, it was so mundane for a mystery.  The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.   Someone needs to give me a book of Barr's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk. (By that I mean words one would use in professions of integrity.)  
 This DVD is edited from the original version.  This movie is HOT, the cut DVD is NOT 
 I am very disappointed with this book.  I wanted a book to help me keep track of my daily intake of calories. Not pages and pages full of the author's opinions and tips on weight loss. A lot of the items listed are commercial food that by law have to carry nutrition info anyway. I am prefectly capable of reading a nutrition lable for calories, I don't need the added step of finding it in this book, which doesn't have a very good order of listing items in my opinion. Instead I recommend "The Doctors Pocket Calorie, Fat & Carbohydrate Counter: 2002 Edition, Plus 101 Fast Food Chains and Restaurants" and "The Complete and Up-to-Date Fat Book: A Guide to the Fat, Calories and Fat Percentages in Your Food" - both of which are available from amazon 
 This is the only one of the series that I've read, and now I doubt I'll bother with the others.  Conant has hung a bunch of red-herring plot twists and turns on a simplistic semi-mystery that in the end is nothing more than a guilty-family-secret story.  Nazis, eugenics, dog shows in the thirties, a Rockefeller heiress, the Isabelle Stewart Gardner museum -- all turn out to be irrelevant to the story line... 
 I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.   Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books. 
 He died for good on October 26, 2005, at Houston, a city he probably never saw in his actual life.  Nobody will remember him any more. He is dead. He will remain  forever as a Black Sock.  
 Do NOT buy this book. I made that mistake but you don't need to!  This book doesn't really teach you anything significant. Phil talks about how much he has won and how good he is and shows you some animal pictures sitting at a internet poker table. Then on the next line he says that you should read the other players body language. Over the internet?! He doesn't even know what he's talking about 
 A Dickens Christmas story is meant to be read in front of the fire with children gathered 'round. As configured in this particular ebook format you cannot do anything but sit in front of your screen and read ninety pages of nineteenth century prose. Not useful at all! This ebook would be far more usefull if, for example, you could copy or print it onto holiday paper. Since this story is in the public domain, blocking those options in this ebook is silly 
 I love Ray Charles when Ray's doing Ray.  This was terrible.  Ray was out of tune, out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous.  I'm sorry Ray, I love you.  It's a shame this had to be one of your last CD's 
 Probably a great resource if you're interested in being a standup comic.  Other than that, there's not really that much in this book I found useful or interesting...  a lot of name-dropping, though!  Apparently every comedian throughout the history of standup has taken one of Judy Carter's classes 
 I am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf.  I had to return it 
 This book's story AND title is a ripoff of the TERRIBLE and RIDICULOUS script the character of Donald Kaufman writes in that movie.  It is unbelievable that this guy seriously wrote the same story and that so many people are taking him and it so seriously.  It's like Metallica releasing their black album.  Hadn't they seen "This is Spinal Tap"  
 If you are looking for a good story and character development, this movie dissapoints. The story is rather thin and slow with more focus on Joe's good looks. A irritatating aspect of the DVD was white flashes occuring at  innapropriate moments during the movie 
 The best animated comedies are funny on two levels;  funny on the surface, for children, and funny at a deeper layer, for adults. "Shrek", for example,  was hilarious on both levels; fully for the littles, and hilarious even for us grownups.   Alas, "Robots" has nothing for anyone over the age of, oh, eight. (Not having a young child handy, mine being away at college, I am unable to say how funny it might be for the littles.)   DO NOT purchase this video expecting to be entertained yourself;  if you must, purchase this video and a book.  Your child can watch the movie, and you can read. 
 I have the older, larger version of this product. However, it uses the same software. The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great, but the software is awful. There is no direct Macintosh program; rather there are templates. They were written for old versions of software and really don't work right. The Windows side includes an actual Print Shop-style program which works awfully. If you do get this, make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint 
 "Yoga for Beginners" sounded easy enough since I know nothing about Yoga. After trying this DVD for 2 weeks I felt like I was locked in a bad Twister game. There are so many instructions flying at you all at once it is almost impossible to keep up. And I knew that I must be doing the poses incorrectly because it HURT! I was ready to toss-in my Yoga towel until I discovered a Rodney Yee beginning Yoga DVD. MUCH better...somehow he manages to get you into the poses with ease and comfort. Skip the Barbara Benagh and look for Rodney 
 the section on toddlers is written entirely from the female perspective assuming that the female actually cares and gets the child. I am a father and have custody and think that this book is garbage for all those dads out there that have their loved one 
 "Find the bad guys and kill them", "unleash the SEAL and DELTA forces everywhere in the world to solve America's problems by assassinating the bad guys" is the Colonel's ultimate solution for securing America and Israel.   It is a bad reputation for the military to produce such dull minded people. Those oversimplify matters with no restrain of rationality.   TKA: Terror Killing Agency is one of the Colonel's gadgets in dealing with the bad guys. The author considers himself an expert in managing violence and assassination and never doubts his irrational approach by asking questions such as: Who are the bad guys? How many are there? Where are they hiding? What keeps them growing? Or what drives them to such desperate outcome?   The author throws the blame on every figure of authority for the sake of gaining public sympathy, yet without offering compelling alternatives. He worries about the safety of Israeli children, yet never hints to the Palestinian children. Assassinating Yasser Arafat is a noble goal and aiding Israel in its racist discrimination against non Jew is perfectly congruent with his American ideals. Israel is run with generals and military experts since its inception which got it in such dismal state of affairs with no friends but the US, no solution but wars.    Ideas such as democracy, justice, fairness, liberty, and pursuit of happiness could secure America more than irrationally driven anger and vengeance. Seeking the root cause of problems could render lasting solution that is hard to find by other short sighted means. The tunnel vision of militarily-minded folks demonstrates the underdeveloped intellectual reasoning in solving problems that involves intricate historic, cultural, and geographical variables. Aggression and fear are the only tools in the repertoire of militarily educated folks.  The irony of contemporary history is vividly evident in such outrageous military doctrines that emphasize technical wizardry as an ultimate safeguard to protect Nazism, Imperialism, and apartheid, the former had been defeated disgracefully by virtue of its impulsive madness and expansionism. The second has been transformed from the French and British colonialism to the American imperialism. Similarly, apartheid had been defeated in America and South Africa, yet still kicking and thriving in Israel with the support of its paternal Imperialistic America.       Mohamed F.

 Wow, it does pain me to knock on Bon Jovi, I love New Jersey, Slippery, Keep The Faith, Cross Road, Crash and Have a Nice Day. All albums are uplifting and cheerful and all contain a handful of raise-your-fist-in-the-air anthems.  I loved all these songs the first time around. Now all the songs, and the album as a whole, has this morbid, undertaking tone to it, as if Johnny Cash was their inspiration behind re-recording their greatest hits stripped down.  The low point is It's My Life, the original is such an upbeat and uplifting anthem, that listening to this version makes me want to drive my car off a cliff, it's that big of a downer! This album is reminiscent of John Mellencamp's Rough Harvest cd, where Mellencamp re-records some hits and album tracks with a more raw, earthy feel to them, but to both artists why? My mother has always stated that she wants Bon Jovi's music to be played at her wake as she loves the band and is in my eyes Bon Jovi's biggest fan. Bon Jovi put out an appropriately themed album to all those fans hoping to have Bon Jovi played at their wake/funeral. 
 I did not feel this book at all. It falls so flat--everything might as well be a cardboard cut-out--that it's hilarious the main character is a celebrated writer. The structure of the story should work: a man living off his waning fame as the author of a celebrated novel leaves his prominence, and his leeching girlfriend, for a small village in France, hoping to recapture his inspiration and find some answers about his past.   Harris fails to deliver in all respects. The novel reads like a first draft, and I wish she'd realized her mistake and threw the manuscript in the fireplace. In light of character Jay's decision at the end and how it must reflect on Harris, you wonder why she even bothered in the first place. With Jay, Harris barely manages to creat a character more talented and wise than she is.   Absolutely terrible. Extra star for sustained effort 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 I remember reading Lynn's book "Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting" and it came at a turning point in my life and I inhaled it like a drowning man inhales air.  Having said that I can only shake my head in sadness for whatever must have happened to Lynn before she passed on. She kept saying in "Dear God! What's Happening to Us", that it sounded crazy and thats the ONE statement in that whole sad book that I agree wholeheartedly with.  I have no idea what happened to Lynn that took her off in what was obviously some sort of delusionment that flew in the face of all that she had written previously, but its very sad.  If you have ever read any of her previous work, please spare yourself the time and money and leave this sad tome on the shelf and remember Lynn when she obviously had all her faculties and was luci 
 I am a 40something male, diagnosed with MS 10 years ago.  Ms Davis seems to have missed her mark! When she writes about "finding your bliss", is she kidding me?  Bliss for most of us who suffer from MS would be to just have 10 minutes without pain, discomfort (I won't start with a list).  Ten minutes, that's all.  Just take away our pain (body and mind)just for this brief instance, would be beyond any bliss you could imagine.  Her biggest and most damaging issue is that NOT ONCE DOES SHE ADDRESS THOSE OF US WHO SUFFER FROM PAIN!  Mostly pain in our bodies, how to deal with it, what to do, who to turn to.  Who is she kidding?  She must not an issue with pain, only numbness.  This is understandable, MS is different in each case.  Actually, if I had to choose, I would have gone more twoards the numbness (in the event I had to make such a horrible choice)  Her Ten steps to moving beyond.... should be retittled: "My walk down the yellow brick road and it like totally stressed me out".  In "Lean on Me" who is there to lean on?  Don't wast your time with this book.  I only give it one star for the references made in the book i.e. web addresses, orginizations etc.  It's the only reason I'm going to keep the book, it will be on my shelf in the reference section.  Sorry Ms Davis, but I had to tell it like "I" see it, in thousands of people.  Just ask Montel Williams about his "pain" issue 
 First, I completely disagree with the major conclusions of this book, and frankly, even with its moral perspective.  I find it to be a one-sided work of propoganda which takes the form of an apologetic for the homogenization of the intellectual professions.  This work is a disgrace, highly misleading, and even dangerous if taken literally or adopted in whole as the correct perspective.  Evidence presented is extremely selective and the interpretation is guided mainly by the authors' predetermined values.  Forget about a balanced, multi-perspective book here.  Aside from the dry academic tone of the title, it is anything but an 'objective' or multi-perspective book. Risks are glossed over and lamentable changes to the academic profession are encouraged to be taken as far as possible in this book.  It is a wolf in sheep's clothing - a book pretending to be by and for academics, with an academic mindset; instead, it's a book by managers who, if they could, would devise standardized tests to determine the competence of professors.  People who see homogenization as inevitable and even desirable.  Not my kind of people. The most disturbing thing about this book is that it is sadly, correct and useful as a vision of where higher education may be headed, and it's a dystopian place.  The state (and particularly, the powerful class that manages the state) does want to control universities very badly, and they are finding "subtle" ways to do it.  This book offers a glimpse into some of the things they plan to do in order to end academic freedom while giving the public (and even some very misled academics) the illusion that academic freedom still exists 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 I found this book to be disappointing. The reason may simply be because The Killer Angels is such a hard act to follow. 
 I wanted to like this book, I reeeeeallly reeeeally did.  But 2/3rds through the story it fell flat on God's frozen smiling face. The story of disgraced Valpariso capt Anthony Van Horne began earnestly enough -angst is always partial to strong protagonists and Morrow's ability to paint the portrait of his lead character shone through brilliantly right up to when he became sexually involved with Cassie Fowler.  Truthfully the story was compelling to me only because it pioneered new material in the sci fi/fantasy genre -no one has ever written a book based on the death of God before- but that's where the innovation ends.   Morrow started out with an intriguing premise and turned it into a Harlequin romance set amidst a surreal, quasi-religious fantasy novel.  Given the white picket fence with little Montessori-schooled Stevie, complete with a talking macaw ending, Towing Jehovah does not inspire me to read the sequels it has since spawned and that is a shame b/c I had such high hopes for this series.  
 "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.  You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.  Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.  The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.  Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.  The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.

 The title and what seemed to be overwhelming praise captured my attention.  When the book arrived I was eager to read it.  I cracked the pages and my jaw dropped, not in a good way.  This book is so poorly written I am baffled  at how it ever got published in the first place.  I read as much as I could but the poor use of language and annoying blocks of italicized text made it impossible.  I returned to Amazon to look at the reviews, again.  This time, rather than just taking the star rating and "featured reviews" at face value, I really went through page by page and evaluated the reviews.  It appears that many, many kids have been assigned to write a review here at Amazon as part of a class project.    If you read through all of the reviews on this site you will see that most of them are written by children.  95% of the kids reviews have given the book a 5 star rating which has thrown off the rating.  If you pay attention to the reviews not written by children you will see that the majority of adults do not enjoy this book.  If you're between the ages of 11 and 13 you, apparently, will love this book.  If you are an adult, who knows better, don't expect much from it.  In my opinion, it is a waste of paper.  (On a side note:  A little time investigating the author brings into speculation about the veracity of his story. 
 This is not an xD to Compactflash card adapter. If you order this item number, you will receive a PC card adapter that accepts xD picture cards and SmartMedia cards and fits your PCMIA 2.1 slot on a PC or Mac. It is not for a camera or substitute for a Compactflash card. There is nothing compact flash about it. The product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon's website 
 I was looking forward to listening to a remastered version of "Scumbag" but it looks like it isn't going to happen. This is like removing the Apple Jam Cd from All Things Must Pass 
 "Endgame" is a crude and despicable play.  It's not a classic and a pitiable excuse of a play.  Utterly useless and does not deserve our time.  The characters are one dimensional, lacking, and unrealistic.  The plot is morally confusing and worthless.  I do not recommend 
 This I by far the worst Scarpetta book in the series. What a shame that Cornwell let this amazing series of books get away from her. First of all, this book does redeem that terrible ending to the preceding work, `Black Notice' in which for the umpteenth time Scarpetta foolishly allows a serial killer into her home for an inevitable dull climax. And this book does have a very engaging premise in which Scarpetta is the victim here on trial, and her name is being sullied. But aside from that, this book is a disaster.   I hated the ending of Black Notice and was furious with Cornwell that she devastated a remarkably taught book with it. Other than that, I thought that the writing was the best she had done and was looking forwards to this new one because it seemed that Cornwell grew as an author from one book to the next. Also I felt that it was well past time that she tried to get away from the very predictable plot line that she has used in every single Scarpetta book up to this point. But for some reason, Cornwell's prose just falls apart here; it is dull and lengthy, without a shred of the suspense that I have grown to expect from this fine author. And the promising plot just collapses as she tries with all of her might to force it into the conformity and safe harbors of her past novels.   Some of what I hated most about this book are that there is no detecting here, Scarpetta just happenstances upon the end solution, its as if Cornwell became tired of writing and just hurried through the last couple of chapters to bring this book to an end. Secondly, Some of what could have made this book interesting, such as Scarpetta's supposed guilt over a murder from `Black Notice' never becomes a full-fledged possibility. Instead Cornwell skates around this alluring plot, spending half of the book building it up, but never pushing it over the edge. Thirdly, what's the point of having any extra characters such as Lucy or Marino? Marino never seems to add anything but bluster, why does Scarpetta always say he is the greatest homicide cop ever? All Marino ever does is leap to the wrong conclusions. Secondly, Lucy and her Last Precinct firm never get off the ground. Why was the Last Precinct firm even in the book? What did Lucy do to help her aunt?  The only interesting thing this book offered was two interactions. One was with the psychiatrist Anna and the other was with the ADA Berger. Both of these scenes either reminiscing over WWII or walking through some evidence were well done.   Cornwell, if you read these, break the mold. Do you have to have serial killers in every novel? Do you have to follow the same plot line?  
 I guess it is a good market now for anything about Islam. This is all old news, looks like reworked columns. Not insightful, not fresh, just tired old stuff mainly about middle to upper class women. Save your money.   
 The title of this book should be an alert as how one could class the oratory work of Abraham Lincoln with Bill Clinton is beyond what a reasonable mind could accept. It is like having Albert Einstein and then including Daffy Duck. For that reason, I wonder of the agenda and the claim that the author knows more than anyone about these speeches and how he can pass over the oratory of the Comanche, Cheyenne and Kiowa at the Medicine Lodge treaty or for that matter neglect the moving speeches of General Patton only to include Betty Friedan who history has already passed over like most to the recent "great" speeches included here. There is just too much a mix of extraordinary with the mundane which appears like a political spin to try and make people like Bill Clinton appear great by sticking him in with Lincoln. How one can compare the destruction of a people in the words of Chief Joseph to what some of these speeches entail is pure rhetoric. One would do better to seek out the people who made the speeches in biographies and autobiographies than to invest in this rendered work, but if you enjoy rolling your eyes in how the compiler includes paid speech writers for leaders with people like Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Chief Joseph.....then you probably will enjoy this book. 1 star to alert readers to think before they buy 
 I read mysteries for the simple enjoyment of it all.  I don't expect great literature - but I struggled to get through this one.  Maybe I've been spoiled by J.A. Jance.  I've come to expect interesting plots and subplots, compelling dialog, and likeable characters.  None of these are evident in Desert Noir.  I'll continue my search for new mystery/suspense writers 
 Boy I had high hopes for this one. Coming off their best album, Shot, and produced by Gang of Four's Andy Gill, I was expecting a masterpiece. The opening track isn't half bad, but the rest is throw-away. Doesn't even  sound like Jesus Lizard. Go get Down or Shot instead 
 Yeah, unlike his first book, which was good, this book seems to be just a weekend's worth of text rambling from a guy trying to steal my money and succeeding. I love Bruce Campbell, but this blatant profiteering makes my skin crawl. I'd rather him do a pop-up book! Next time, Mr. Campbell, hire a ghost writer 
 Maybe this book would have been better if the illustrations were better & the colors weren't so off.  Our toddler was not interested in this book at all & I could see why.  This was not one of Wood's best books- try The Big Hungry Bear or King Bidgood's in the Bathtub.  But if you're interested in a book similar to Quick as a Cricket and one SO much better, get A Dragon in a Wagon, by Lynley Dodd 
 Looking for a bit of sea adventure?  Fancy a run with some real life salts who face whatever the hurricane ravaged winter seas throw at them?  Well don't go looking to Redmond O'Hanlon's "Trawler".  O'Hanlon takes two potentially fascinating subjects - trawler fishing and the biology behind the creatures of the seas - and blends them into a putrid stew of nothingness.  This is a very difficult book to read. Physically difficult! Aye!  O'Hanlon's pointless, manic use of exclamation and emphasis - EMPHASIS! Aye! - lends nothing to the story but then there is so little story, it's really no loss.  "Trawler" dredges the bottom of literary technique and hauls up nothing but stream of consciousness drivel.  I found the book a total waste of time and will certainly never read another piece of work by O'Hanlon.  Aye!  I won't!  Never! 
 I read them all.  Grishim, Turrow, etc.  Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should.  There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped.  The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.    Kermit, you have the talent.  Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us 
    Reilly fans will probably find his latest novel to be quite a disappointment. For some reason, Reilly forsakes all the things that made his earlier books great.  Instead, this novel is a thinly disguised political statement which reveals Reilly's prejudices against various governments and religions. The plot is obviously borrowed from "The Da Vinci Code" and the characters are one-dimensional pawns whose main purpose is to verbalize Reilly's personal ideology.  For the first time in a Reilly book, I managed to finish the book out of sheer determination rather than out of any interest in the plot or characters. 
 I loved Steel's early works.  I read them all and they were great but have stopped reading her because her books are repetitive now.  I decided to try once again just to see and this book was maddening!!  It was 178 pages long and could have been all been said in 100 pages.  It was obvious that she was stretching it to make it a hardback "novel" length to sale.  Skip it.  
 If you visited with Vidal in "Myron" and "Live from Golgotha" then you'll find this book a tired re-hash of attempts to alter time and fun and games with historical characters.  Same blase and  cynical tone.  However, what this book sorely lacks is a character with the  style of Myra Breckinridge to handle the proceedings 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 Embraced By The Light by Betty J. Eadie is actually a pretty good book, well written, and probably well-researched from other people's NDE's.  This book is filled with some great stuff, but also some not so great stuff.  Eventually, no matter how open your mind is, it becomes clearer and clearer that some of these things are either made up or a rip-off from other NDE accounts.  The author seems sincere and it is a heartfelt account.  I could actually feel myself in her shoes in each page of the book, and empathize with her.  The book is heart-wrenching at times and I actually sobbed.  Not so much in sorrow, but a sadness mixed with joy.  The book is very bittersweet but filled with hope, and it provides an invaluable message...  That the most important thing in life is to enjoy life and to love each other.  Now what I just wrote would make the book worth 5 stars.  However, this is where the scale tips backwards.  The book is biased.  She goes on to say that while she was in "heaven" in her NDE, she realized that the creator of the Universe and all else is Jesus Christ himself.  Of course the description of Jesus is the typical white man with a beard with a light glowing from within his beard.  That's all fine and good.  BUT, Mrs. Eadie forgets to say that the creator of the Universe presented itself to HER as Jesus Christ.  This is not a Universal Truth, it is the author's truth.   Eadie makes a good point that while in "heaven," she learned that it is foolish to criticize other people's religious beliefs, or lack of...  Then she ruins this promising statement by indicating that Christianity is at the top rung and that all other religions don't hold the same love and promises as the gospel.  To a Christian or Mormon, this would make sense, but the TRUTH is that all religions or lack of them are EQUAL.  Christianity is no better than Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Wicca, Paganism, Tao, or any others.  To think that one is better, more true, or superior to another (even if the bible says so), is just plain ignorance.  The bias on the importance of men is another downfall for the book, going back to women being weaker in nature than men and that it was "Eve's impatience" or whatever in the "garden of eden" (a biblical fable no more true than the myth of Pandora's Box) that brought death into the world.   Men and women are EQUAL, period.  This book also slams the concept of reincarnation.  Reincarnation can't quite be scientifically proven, but it is on the brink.  Shame on you Mrs. Eadie.  But if that's her perspective and what she thought she learned in "heaven," than she is entitled to her "conclusion."  Remember folks...  There can be as many similarities in many individual's Near-Death Experiences as there are differences.  Something that is important to know is that Jesus or Jehovah or Angels are not any more true, real, living, or righteous than Pan, Dionysus, Horus, Osiris, Isis, Demeter, Diana, Hecate, Buddha, Shiva, Krishna, etc, for representations of the Creator.  People need to decide for themselves which form of God or Goddess (YES, GOD COULD BE FEMALE, it's not impossible, no matter what the bible, the kuran, or the book or mormon says) to believe in and/or worship.  Overall, this is a decent book, despite its faults and biases.  To a Christian, Mormon, and/or a New Ager, who is dealing with death and dying, or has someone close to you who is, I highly recommend this book to you.  Even to non-Christians, this isn't an entirely bad read, but there are much better accounts for non-Christians and all are just as valid as Mrs. Eadie's.  Remember, the most important thing in life is to enjoy it and to love one another.  
 I ordered this kettle specifically to avoid heating up water in plastic. However, this  kettle emitted a foul chemical odor that also transferred to the water. I boiled it a few times plus tried the water/vinegar suggestion in the brochure but nothing seemed to help. I decided that I didn't want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so I'm returning it - it's not worth the risk. I can't figure out if it's coming from the "stainless steel" bulb  (that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass & the bulb. Plus the lid has a stong odor too & that is plastic covered in "stainless steel" 
 Many of my friends and I have read the same book.We come to the same conclusion of this book having an agenda to dogmatize our country with meaningless gender bias.In my opinion there is nothing more dangerous to a country and the world as to limit  our children's ability to wether the child is male or female. Gurian does not offer any proof as others have stated in the  reviews as to how these differences come about.He says it's the hormones,the brain structure.I have read other matierial which has disclosed findings which condradict his so called research. If he were correct in assuming hormones then I would be much more drenched with testostrone than my half brother since I excell at math and he at lanuage.Brain structure varies from person to person,something I doubt he would like you to know. Instill independence and individuality in all your children  by seeing them as people rather than sexes. I cannot think of anything worse than leading your child down the wrong "learning style" road,simply because of their sex. People tend to want to agree with anything they read  and be  a good follower.It's better to think for yourself and be a  good leader and helper in your child's life by giving them room to grow the way they want to and without trying to controll  their interests or believing they will only show talent in small sterotyped boxes.Terrible book written by someone  who is trying to distort your child's life to make $$$$$$ 
 I suppose this is a good book for someone who is just learning how to play poker.  I didn't have much faith in the book when I purchased it.  It's cheaper than alot of poker books, so I figured Hellmuth would at least share a couple of good nuggets of information.  If you have never played poker and want to learn the rules of the game, and starting hand strengths, you will benefit from this book.  If you're a thinking player looking for insights from others, look somewhere else 
 It's refreshing to read that so many others here can see through Tosches as the "literary" equivalent of a snakeoil salesman.  I've worked in the industry so I know that copywriters at least attempt to come up with the jacket- or cover-copy that will entice readers into buying the book. But a writer with Tosches' clout usually gets to write his own copy. So, with that in mind--DINO, while allegedly a depiction of how down-and-dirty Dean Martin really was (yes, the man was flawed and he did some bad things--but Frankie Sinatra did a LOT of MUCH worse things) is actually a book about an entertainer, Martin, who was a genuinely, physically and mentally tough man (the type who Sinatra pretended to be--Dino didn't need bodyguards to do his fighting) who was beloved by his female costars, who found him to be genuinely funny, charming, and a true gentleman. One alleged insult to a call girl quoted on the mass market cover--who flattered herself that she could take Dino for a ride--does not contradict this. He was streetwise and when he told Jerry Lewis "you can talk about love all you want, you're just a f**king dollar sign to me," it was in the context of having played second bananna to a narcissitic, juvenile cretin, for year. For example, Lewis was so obnoxious that, in an episode of the old Colgate Comedy Hour, he kept interrupting Martin to upstage Dino was he attempted to seen what was his hit song. Who wouldn't to throttle the little punk?  I see that Tosches' "biography" of Arnold Rothstein--the famous gambler who fixed the 1919 World Series--is subtitled to call this a story that's never been told before. Do an Amazon search. Do a Google search. Okay, Rothstein is not a household name but anyone who has read a few books on American gangsters has heard of Rothstein. "A.R.," as he was known, is NOT an overlooked figure in histories of the era.   Tosches is a "wannabe," as another post stated, and yet another post(s) commented on his faulty research skills, irrelevant digressions, and affected prose.  But you know what really got me pissed about this Liston book? Tosches states--as though it were an indisputable fact--that the last fight Rocky Marciano had, against the great Archie Moore, was fixed. Archie took a dive to preserve the Great White Champ's record.   Just like that. This is a historically significant allegation and one that has not been made before (at least not in any serious reportage). Does Toshces cite a source for this bombshell? God forbid. He makes this statement without batting an eye or even addressing why this charge has never been revealed by any of the truly great boxing writers who have preceded Tosches. I'm sure Bert Randolph Sugar, for one, would have touched on this years ago, if it had even a grain of truth.  In truth, Archie Moore's gripe was that the ref--after Moore had hit Marciano with a shot so hard it's said to have lifted the Rock several inches off his feet before he hit the canvas--gave the Rock the equivalent of a "long count," allowing the younger and stronger Marciano precious seconds to recover and knock out Moore.  Other boxing writers (Sugar, for one, I believe), some who were present at the fight, others who have seen the B&W film footage, respectfully disagree. Moore was a great champ, a great fighter, and a proud man. NO doubt about that. And he gave the Rock one hell of a fight. He came thisclose to winning the heavyweight title. So did Billy Conn against Joe Lewis. (Was that a fix, too?) It must be difficult to deck an opponent with a punch that would ended the fight against virtually any other opponent in that weight class and then see him, in true Marciano fashion, rise from the canvas, shake off the punch, and come back at you like a wrecking machine.   But Toshces' version? Hell, he just makes a statement out of "punchyland" that suits his biases. Were it true, it would be a helluva revelation, a story that would capture the attention of boxing aficionados--if it were only true.  Toshes is, indeed, a con artist. He tries to dazzle you with his footwork but has little to back it up.  Sonny Liston deserves a better biographer, one that keeps the spotlight on his subject and not on himself. 
 The reason I am giving one star to this book is because a lot of people have given 5 stars to it. Personally I would give it about 2 and a half stars.  The main reasons for my low rating are: - The book jumps in to configuration commands without giving the proper links. The information is too disjointed. Too few actual configuration examples. The book seems littered with config commands without talking much about what info is shown by the specific show commands. How to use the commands in troubleshooting scenarios et al.  - The way in which the information is presented could have been better. Concepts seem to have been explained in a half hearted manner. And per point one, the author jumps directly to config commands.  + The book does a good job at covering the exam. If you wanna clear the exam, this book is for you. However, if you wanna understand stuff and then actually clear the exam, be prepared to go to other sources. One excellent reference source is the CCIE Cisco LAN switching book. I ended up reading about 18 chapters (out of 20) from this book, and I only came to know about the CCIE book later on. I got it and yes it was worth every cent. Any concept (except QoS) that I needed clarification was present in the CCIE book 
 I just want to say, this book is BAD.  The characters have no change and/or development that doesn't make them meaner, cruder people, and the whole book is FAR too shapeless and confusing.  The main character is a boy  that goes against his parents' wishes to go to church, who eventually  cusses and has few associates.  His remarks against girls were unpleasant  to me as a female reader, and his desciption of Preacher Man was of a guy  who sweated and had freaky eyes.  Talk about pointless.  This book is a  disgrace to literature 
 We expose our babies/toddlers to a wide variety of cultural sources, in several languages.  Therefore, having seen similar products it seemed logical to purchase this one, given it is touted as a multilingual introduction to their environment (our little ones are trilingual: English, Spanish and ASL, and they ignore us in all them!).  Big mistake.  The video not only reinforces but solidifies the sexist portrayal of love so prevalent in other Baby Einstein (BE) items.  In earlier BE products one could see only female hands manipulating objects as they presented them on screen.  Male hands were never present.  This video goes many steps furhter by featuring male figures only in the background, or at best, an elderly man briefly interacting with a child.  Everywhere else you see multiple females lovingly playing, caring or otherwise being nurturing to children.  Males are only seen (with the exception of a black couple in bed while kids jump to play with them) in a distant background in entirely detached attitudes, or at least distant, dry and quiet poses, such as talking with a much older (male) child.  It is as if they are shown there as part of the domestic landscape, however as movable and inane as potted plants, whom you can move and place at will.  I felt insulted by this condescending and disqualifying view of male love and nurturing abilities.  Asides, when you go into the Spanish version, it is (for a professionally produced video) riddled with mistakes.  Three objects are mislabeled.  In the first, when a cup - the plastic or paper tall type , not the coffee and saucer version, it is called "la taza", when in reality it should be "el vaso", as unlike English, where it is interchangeable "vaso" is  the specific word for that item.  The second - much worse instance, still in the kitchen was to introduce a bowl.  There, the clueless scripter translated it as "el bol", a clear and poor corruption of the English word into a one commonly used in Spanglish, instead of calling it "tazo'n", as its correct name is.  The last one I saw was in the yard (I'm suprised they didn't call it la yarda!: "Looka mami! get la troca and go a la marketa a buy a boncha de carrotas!").  This time they called an obvious swing (two ropes and a seat in between) "la hamaca", when in reality hamaca means hammock.  Fortunately, we are native speakers amnd are abel to catch these pitfalls, but many people relies upon these products to teach their kids other languages.    In sum I was discusted with the whole thing.            
 I only needed this for school a little while back. Now I am marketing in Hawaii at a resort and realizing this book taught me little to nothing. Have fun with it if you please though 
 This book reads like a text book or graduate thesis.  Those with short attention spans need not pick up this book.  While it did make some enlightening points on the pervasiveness and necessity of metaphors in our thought process, the book then trudges on for about another 100 needless pages.  The basic point of the authors is that; "...we define our reality in terms of metaphors and then proceed to act on the basis of metaphors."  In the process they get quite wordy and go through lengthy explanations including one long discourse on why we understand a sentence to be true.  It tests your self-discipline to keep reading.  The last 40% of the book then dives into a lenghty debate of objectivism vs. subjectivism and the presentation of their experientialist alternative.  The authors present and then continue to rehash their arguments in a debate against a nameless opponent: the evil objectivist.  There is some lip service paid to the less evil subjectivist.  I did gain a new understanding of the importance of metaphors in our language and thought, but not much else that I wanted to learn. The information that I found useful could have been presented in a much shorter form, perhaps a white paper 
 Aesthetic choices are interesting.  Does it mean anything that the IOS packaging is elegant verging on impersonal, sort of like hotel room art, ditto the almost cool yet generic techno music bumpers?  If you've never seen Wilber, it's interesting to see him teaching in a corporate blue suit, then catch a different glimpse of the comic book hero persona at home, shaved head, tinted glasses, lovely ripped-up physique-at home, so there's a personal touch right?  Yet throughout I felt a tight, controlled stance, a veil between me, purchaser of IOS and Wilber, something I did not feel when reading the superb "A Brief History of Everything," though now that I think of it--there really was no intimacy between me, reader, and authorial persona, rather I was listening in on conversation between Q & KW.  Why does he tell it at a slant?    Wilber frequently verbalizes "we" as opposed to "I", not the royal "we," I'm sure but rather "we at the Institute."  This would be lower left quadrant if you want to get integral, though basic knowledge of grammar suffices-no need for Integral Calculus-not I, Ken, interacting with students in a raw, unscripted manner or presenting information specially recorded for me, purchaser of this kit.  This is an arrangement of carefully excerpted bits from the Institute archives, questions voiced-over by cyber-babe, as if accomplished without Wilber's participation, including "rare" audio bits-something that always kills me when we're talking about a living personality.  Or is he?  OK, I get it.  He might be dead, and that's the point:  Wilber, "principal architect of the IOS" is supposed to be in the background paring his nails so that the theory, the Institute live on, separate from any cult of personality.    Smart.  Except I'm obviously not the ideal purchaser of this multimedia product; likely this product exists because folks requested something like it.  I can love a mind-or a book even, aesthetically, can love the weight, the feel, the smell-but I can't love a map.  I understand I'm likely the minority view-usually am.  My husband, for example, loves maps, and no matter how empathic I believe I am, when I try to imagine what he feels tracing his finger along a map route, I always hit a wall.  One of our ongoing marital disputes involves wall dcor; I want art, he wants maps.  Guess who wins?  Maps are cheaper.  Might as well frame newsprint.  I loved "Brief History" to the same degree that I loathe this IOS 1.0; I remember thinking, when I read "History," that I could photocopy Wilber's maps and, you know, place them over my desk for a while in order to contemplate them; but I thought the more important point was not the map but my interpretation or internalization of the map.  I'm slave to no man's map.  I knew better than to buy a kit; any woman will tell you it's a raw deal and you end up with lots of packaging and unusable eye shadow shades.  But I thought, let's see about Wilber's kit, anyway.  I don't like decontextualization or, in this case, recontextualization, don't like reworked stuff; it smacks, ironically, of a kind of reductionism so that the focus on developing higher states of consciousness seems like simple self-absorption or yet another in the American tradition of self-improvement.  Next time, I'll go for greater complexity and contextual richness and pick a Wiber book instead.  So here's a postscript, for what it's worth.  I had a minute and did a super-quick scan of the Wilber web-sites, and the question that struck me, as a thirty-something mommy, was this:  do children exist in the Wilberian universe?  If a theory of integral parenting exists, I'd love to read more, but meanwhile I'm working toward an idea of evolutionary parenting on my own.  If you're not a parent, or if you're a Boomer and did that a long time ago, you won't care about what I'm saying, but it is relevant in terms of demographics and integral practice, and the obvious strikes me now, that this product exists for either my mother (though she probably can't run a DVD) or my baby sister, but not for someone at my stage of life; that I'm interested in Wilber's work is probably anomalous.   Consider Wilber's concept of the essential modules of integral practice:  physical, cognitive, psychodynamic and meditative.  First, we're given a hypothetical integral practitioner named Jackie, who takes a daily multivitamin, rides her bike to work, does power yoga, visits a massage therapist, studies the AQAL model, keeps a dream journal and meditates.  Can someone please differentiate Jackie from your average nice, socially-conscious, single, self-absorbed San Franciscan, elbow-deep in the descended grid, for me?  If Jackie's lucky, she can meet most of these needs at her local health club/spa, then pedal to the ferry building for organic take-out, so maybe Integral Institute should open a line of wellness centers.  My main point is that Wilber is advocating the balanced life, and I'm all for that, as some cultures maintain balance as the essential mark of the cultivated or scholarly life; perhaps only in America would we be so atomized that we need "cross-training" spelled out.  At the same time, intrinsically integral "peak" experiences-those that potentially fuse mind-body-spirit and dispel ascending or descending impulses-such as childbirth should not be discounted within a larger framework of integrated life experience, and I think an important distinction should be made between, say, smoking pot, and conscious childbirth.  I'd maintain that other viable forms of integral practice exist, and that some people may accumulate integrated life experience in terms of phases, clumps, decades; for example, in my twenties I actively pursued the physical mode in law-enforcement training, followed by a more cognitively-focused period as a graduate fellow.  My husband and I are now in that phase of life, career-building for him, child-rearing for me, where the idea of finding half an hour to meditate is ludicrous-our lives are totally out of balance now, but that's OK.  You see a similar pattern among highly-successful people who spend decades leading unbalanced lives in the pursuit of success and who then, at a later stage, pursue a more balanced approach, made possible, ironically, by the money, leisure time, etc. afforded by their earlier single-minded drive.  I'm assuming, thus, that this product is aimed mainly at those Boomers who have time and energy for self-improvement.    
 ...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.  If you want to get an "inside view" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!  What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.  The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!  I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.  I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed.. 
 I honestly don't know what to think of my reactions to books by Maureen McKade.  I've read seven of her books.  Four I've rated 5 stars, three zero stars.  I'm sorry to say that the only reason I gave this one two stars (zero in my personal notation book) is because I have enjoyed other stories from Ms. McKade so very much.  I have my notes on other McKade books and am amazed.  Evidently I either love her stories or I don't like them at all.  Sorry to say, this is a don't like it at all for me.  Widow Laurel Covey is on a mission to visit the families of soldiers who made death bed statements to her while she was a nurse for the Confederate side in the war which ended just six months past.  Creede Forrester was searching for her to find out if she knew whether his son had died in battle.  His information indicated his son was wounded but now that the war is over, he cannot find his son.  Once he finds Laurel and understands what her mission is, his conscience will not allow him to let her make the last visitation trips alone.  He goes along with her even though she plainly states that she does not want him. This story does not "resonate with heartfelt emotion" as the cover states, for me   it was just plain depressing.  Everything turned out well for Laurel and Creede in the ending but it was a struggle for me to wade through all the war recollections and emotional baggage Laurel was carrying.  I know, I know.  That was the whole point of the story, but uplifting it was not!  A little bit of "happy" along the way would have gone a long way toward making this an easier read.  So very much seriousness just weighed me down.  I didn't WANT to finish reading it but I did.  Was the introduction of the starving, orphaned kitten supposed to form some of the "happy" moments which were otherwise sadly lacking?  If so, it didn't work out that way for me.  How could we be expected to believe that a starving, orphaned kitten could walk fifteen miles from one campsite to the next?  If the starving, orphaned kitten could do it, why did the perfectly healthy horses only make it those fifteen miles?  See, I'm being picky, picky, picky.  But once it starts, everything begins to snag my attention and I loose concentration and the desire to continue to read.  Sorry to be so negative but I just cannot see myself recommending this to anyone without a strong warning first.  I have two more Maureen McKade books left to read.  If my yo-yo is correct, surely one of them should be a five star read.  
 I thought this would be the ultimate gym bag. The main compartment is too narrow. Your shoes will not fit side by side, you have to stack them. The pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough. The zippers are cheap and stick. It is very pretty but not very functional. My $16.00 bag works much better.  
 I found this book somewhat helpful, but felt in the long run that it was a waste of money.  We will get all of the same types of information by actually visiting the schools 
 When I first got into broadcasting over 30 years ago I quickly learned about radio groupies, the DJ's "biggest fans" who call the request lines to tease and flirt with the DJ in that seductive, yet deceptive voice.  Because a friend recommended that I must see this movie, I, fortunately, learned the easy way how not to fall into the trap many many DJs have gotten into and continue to get into.  I have in turn have suggested the same to new, up and comming DJs to watch, learn and heed.  Although this does a good job teaching rookie Djs a course in ethics, the film as a film kind of stinks that's why the two stars.  Poor lighting and sound makes this a true B movie 
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 This one should be called Knit Scarves (there are only about 4 ponchos and 3 wraps)  The Ponchos are not impressive either...  Very misleading and disappointing.  I should have read Editorial Review on the book description - which put the book in its place.    I also should have caught the first reviewer on the 3 Ponchos comment.  Not sure what to do with this book and I don't feel like knitting any of the scarves either!  
 This is a $22 tee ball? Maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place, since these should cost about $2 at your local sporting goods store. Maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package (but it doesn't say that clearly on the page).  Bottom line is don't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue 
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels.  it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it.  this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book.  it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle.  but the result is a less satisfying book.  it skims rather than digs deep 
 I wanted to like this book, as I love history and this was "supposed" to be a historical book.  It's far from it.  This book is all about James Carroll and his trials and tribulations as he proceeds through life, with plenty of blame for everyone, especially those close to him.  It's mindlessly tiresome, with repetitions, almost exact phrasing, appearing again and again throughout the text.  He got some kind of award for this thing, but how he got it blows my mind.  Because he is an onerous, tiresome and awkward writer who will put a subject on one line and the reader will have to assiduously search for the verb six or seven lines away.  Multiple "invisible parenthesizing" with key words that he hopes the reader understands.  I skipped through the book, hoping and praying for something historically substantial.  Especially having to do with the Constantine part.  It never happens.  This was a waste of my time and money and I'm very disappointed.  He should refund my money.  What a rip-off 
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 This my first review on Amazon but I was compelled to write based on my experience with this course. The first CD is fantastic. It starts off slow and gives you a solid foundation to build upon as you move from lesson to lesson. Within a few weeks of driving back and forth to work I had mastered all the lessons on the CD and could easily translate the English phrases in the final review lesson into Italian. I was confident and had a good grasp on building sentences and nuances such as how words changed when the subject was masculine or feminine. My opinion is that most people write their review based on the first CD.  And then I put in the second CD. I thought there was some mistake, as if I had switched to a completely different Italian course. The slow, clear speaking narrators were gone and replaced with fast talking Italians who didn't repeat anything, and certainly didn't give you time to repeat in the pause. The assumption appeared to be that I already understood the language and this was merely a refresher course. Within ten minutes I knew this was no longer the course for me. I listened to the entire second CD just in case this was all a joke and at some point they would slow down and actually help me learn Italian. No such luck! I have gone back to using the first CD for practice while I wait for the Pimsleur Italian course to arrive 
 Do you like zombie movies? Of course you do, otherwise you wouldn't be here. But do you like piss-poor make-up design,  God-awful special effects & horrendous lighting? Probably not.  The best thing I can say about this flick is that it comes with 2 discs. The first (Plaga Zombie)is almost certainly a college project.(So I won't comment further on that one. But the second disc (Plaga Zombie: Mutant Zone) should have been better since it was the follow-up with a bigger (I assume) budget.  Anyways; The music was  a little over-exaggerated and seemed like it was trying to make this flick more serious than it really was. (Except the "John West" song, which I still find myself singing. In fact that whole scene is the best part of the movie.) When it comes to zombie comedies, you can do alot better than this one. (ie: Dead-Alive, Return of the living Dead Part 2, Shaun of the Dead) Don't get me wrong, the directors have potential. But that potential would be better geared toward slap-stick comedies, not horror comedies.  Just a Side Note: The main attraction of any zombie flick is the undeads prosthetic make-up.(Peeling Flesh/Half-Eaten Lips/Severed limbs and Disembodied torsos/ etc.) Suffice to say, Absolutely none of these zombies even so much as resembled zombies. (or acted like zombies for that matter). They look more like college kids after Halloween night.  MORAL OF THE STORY:  Time & Money are Precious Commodities.                       To Waste Them on this Flick is Unethical. 
 Unlike 90% of those that have reviewed this book, I have actually read it!  I will not write a bought-and-paid-for glowing review stating how brilliant this author is to exposing the "evil" psychiatrists and their crusade to "manufacture" various conditions for their own advancement and that of the pharmaceutical industry.  It is absolute garbage and, unfortunately, paints psychiatrists in a poor light.  If you are fascinated by Scientology and believe that those that practice psychology are evil, fine, purchase this book and read it as you sit upon your organic toilet. 
 I highly admire the work of Dr. Paul Lam through Tai Chi, but was extremely disappointed that the review says you CAN listen to a sample, yet no samples are available.   Would you be able to correct this error, please 
 This book could have been written by the "the N.I.C.E" from C.S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength.  This is quite simply the most cynical book I've ever read. There are no positive messages or characters. The Heart of Darkness, an exploration of evil in us all, is cheerful in comparison.  The setting is a religious (Catholic) school called Trinity. The teachers and administrators are called brothers (Jesuits?). The brothers are all either completely corrupt, complicit or psychologically weak. The main character who fights for his own road, in the end, recants. His friend, the only other marginally moral character is portrayed as both weak and unwilling to go against the group, no matter what the cost. The other characters are either portrayed as amoral (Archie) or unwilling to stand up to the promptings of their conscious.   I guess this last point is the most disturbing yo me. There are many characters who are prompted by their conscience to act against some kind of wrong, they all ultimately FAIL TO ACT ON IT.  The main message: Life is pointless and filled with selfish and hateful people. Trying to fight against this (no matter what your conscience tells you) is futile. Those who are the most self-serving and manipulative triumph in the end.  I found this book fully out of touch with reality. I have been down some dark roads in my life and in 42 years have yet to meet anyone as selfish and malevolent as Archie or Brother Leon. The sheer numbers of bad and weak-willed in one school is just absurd.     
 What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
 Definitely rated five stars if your under the age of ten. Adults beware.  These guys have run out of ideas since the first season and are proceeding on the fumes from their fart jokes. I hope Trey and Parker make vast amounts of money to help pay for voice impersonation lessons. Besides the smugness, I am tired of all the voices in South Park sounding all too similar. 
 I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents).  I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)  My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he "met."  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.  The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading.  After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.  So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed.  
 This poorly laid out, badly written book claims to have covered both Regency and Victorian England, but really only covers Victorian.  Worse yet, it isn't always specific about what year it's covering, so it can be  confusing since the two time periods are so different.  If you're looking  for a good Regency reference, get What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens  Knew.  It's a better resource by ten fold!  If you're looking for an OK  Victorian reference, this might be the book for you 
 I bought this because Raquel Welch was in it. She did a good job but it's not worth it. I loss interest as sonn as I heard the guy talking about the people in the movie. This DVD was dated back to the 1920s and How a movie star struggles to get his life back 
 The first film in this trilogy, Koyaanisqatsi, is a classic, and features what is possibly the best score Philip Glass ever wrote for anything.  The second, Powaqatsi, is not as good but still worth watching.  This third installment offers none of the thought-provoking imagery of the first two films. It's just a mishmash of computer-treated footage, signifying nothing, and all quite forgettable. I wonder what went wrong?  Don't waste your time 
 I bought a Capresso 114.01 espresso machine via Amazon in December of 2005. I had selected it in part, because of the high "bar" pressure rating. Upon receiving it, the first shot of espresso took several minutes to make. The coffee just drips out one drop at a time. The manual suggests "using a coarser grind than other espresso machines". I tried progressively coarser grinds until I was at the coarsest setting of my burr gringer...the coffee was getting weaker, and coming out a little faster, but still taking many minutes for one shot of espresso, with a weak and bitter result and no crema. The manual suggests tamping the coffee ever so lightly. Good suggestion, because if you tamp it with more than a feather's weight of pressure, you get no coffee flow at all. I called Capresso technical support numerous times. They suggested disassembling the machine--unscrewing the metal screen on the body of the machine where the water comes through-- and cleaning it. I did this to no avail. Besides, one shouldn't need to service a machine that is less than a month old in this way! After two months of frustrating, hit-and-miss results, I returned the machine to Amazon. Because it's after the 30 day return period, I may not get a full refund, but I'm glad to be rid of that piece of junk. I have since purchased a $180 Krups XP 4000 espresso machine that just works beautifully, with any grind of coffee (even very fine), any tamping pressure (even quite firm), the machine produces 2 shots of espresso in 25 seconds flat with tons of crema. What a relief 
 I think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush, but I immediately encountered some problems with the toy that I think are worth mentioning.  First, the battery box is very poorly designed.  Once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again.  The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open.  Now, if I handle the toy, the box keeps falling out!   My second comment is that the sound effects are pretty bad.  The sounds quality is poor and it doesn't always sound like a dog 
 The first thing a man over 30 should never do: buy an offensive, elitist book telling them how they should live their own life.  You've got to love the wisdom of the book.  For instance, a man over 30 should never know a vegan, according to the book.  Way to alienate a crowd, Esquire.  Lovely.    EDIT: Oh, I understand perfectly that its a humor book.  Its just not funny 
 This story line is probably one you've already read by another author, and it's very easy to tell how the book will end.  The details of the book are original, and it does move along and hold your interest, but it's a repeat of a relationship between two people.  I was actually surprised that Ms. Steel would go down this road, and not offer something more original.  
 What a mess this is... This "darkly intoxicating brew" (The Guardian) picks up the story of young a young Scottish lass (see his debut,  "Morvern Callar") as she returns from the continent. She comes  to a wee little island where honeymooners stay at a weird hotel, and  there's a cast of supporting bizarros. Really tough to get through and none  too rewarding despite occasionally clever language at times. Warner's got  talent, but try his much more accesible "The Sopranos" before  trying this 
 I purchased the Adobe e-book version of this book assuming it would be easier to use for reference than the print version. I was wrong. The Find feature is slow, cumbersome, and doesn't support Boolean searches. You can't copy or print even the smallest portions of the text. You cannot jump to a reference from its listing in the index. And when you click on the highlighting tool, you'll accidentally hit a link that periodically pops up for Amazon.com, opening your browser whether you want to or not. You cannot return this e-book, though you will be tempted to. Save yourself the money and buy a used copy and some sticky notes 
 This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts 
 The official censes of the Ottoman Empire in the early 1900s showed well over five million Christians living in the provinces of what are now modern Turkey.  Western specialists who helped the Turks conduct their censes stated that the Turks purposely undercounted the Christians and overcounted the Turks.  So, there were many more than just five million Christians.  There are now approximately only a hundred thousand Christians in Modern Turkey.  The question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the early 1900s and only a hundred thousand people today.  We know that over a million surviving Greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923.  Again, what happened to the huge difference of 4-5 million people?  To the 1.5 million massacred Armenians, must be added three quarters to a million Assyriac Christians (Aramaic-speaking Arab Christians) and as many as two million Greeks (almost 30 percent of the Greek people).  The author does not touch on the large numbers of Christians who were enslaved by Turks or forced to convert to Islam to avoid massacre which explains the large number Greek-speaking "Turks" around Trebizon on the Black Sea.    It is not as if there is not vast contemporary accounts of neutral and Western observers of this enormous genocide and ethnic cleansing of the original, pre-Turkish populations of Anatolia.  I can only conclude that the author had such an inborn bias in favor of Turkey as to ignore a slaugher that approaches the Jewish holocaust of WWII.  Avoiding this subject amounts to holocaust denial.    The Christian genocide was the first great genocide of the 20th century and Hitler's model for the Jewish genocide. The massacre of the Greek and Armenian population of Smyrna (now Izmir) ranks with the Rape of Nanking in sheer horror and scale, but the author skips over it in a rush to avoid any detail of the crime or assign any blame except to the Greeks and Armenians by repeating the discredited canard that they set fire to their own city.    The author's treatment of the Christian genocide reminds me of the comments to me of a Turkish officer at a NATO conference which were to the effect that there had been no Armenian genocide (the Turkish Government official line) but, in any case, that they had deserved it.  The author seems to have taken her treatment of the subject from the Turkish Government as well 
 Think of everything that you would despise in a movie. Throw that all in to one, and you get New York Minute. In addition to an excruciatingly terrible plot line, 3rd grade acting, and horrific accents, you also get incessantly annoying 'actors' ripping an hour and a half of your life. An hour and a half that you can never get back, and that may end in some need for cleansing as a human being and the reassurance that, by the way, the world isn't completely full of morons.  Admittedly, I approached the film warily, and I didn't expect much, but I was hoping for a slightly enjoyable film at least, for I am easily pleased. But I was not even granted that relief, and so I sat through the film...hoping against hope that maybe, just maybe there would be a redeeming factor near the end.   There wasn't. 
 I really liked Mythology and Black Utopia, though the engineering / mix on BU was poor. But this album is even worse. Musically it goes no where. Almost like he was trying to copy previous attempts but ran out of ideas. The "Featuring Billy Idol and Slash" thing is an absolute joke. Some how he got these guys to do an absolutely horrible version of In The Summertime. It's so bad it's hard to believe any one would put it on a CD other than to draw attention and sales from the names. Too bad, I had higher expectations from this guy 
 Hard to believe this book is worse than "One Arrow, One Life..."...Kushner actually did a better job at explaining Kyudo & Zen, but fell short in other areas-(see my review of that book if you wish). In "Zen in the Art of Archery"  Herrigel is searching to understand Kyudo, he doesn't get it for a very long time. Example, I loved this line from the book..."I pointed out to the Master that I was already in my fourth year and that my stay in Japan was limited". Now that's funny. So he stayed on another 2 years. The "Master" is constantly running circles around him, e.g.,...Herrigel..."And who or what is this "It"?....The Master..." Once you have understood that you will have no further need of me..." This is painful mind drivel to read. Save your money. 
 I thought some of the techniques seemed like ones that would only make the situation worse. No wonder there is a big legal disclaimer at the front.  I prefer the books by Namie & Namie,  Patricia Evans, and Tim Field's website bullyonline.org 
 I came to this book with great anticipation. I had read its a modern American classic, a gem that is full of meaning. I thought I was in for a treat.   I worked my way through it, and wondered where, in God's name, it was going, and why I bothered reading it.   Its a huge bore, a monumental waste of time. Binx is about as dull as anyone can be, and none of the other characters are interesting. The reader goes from one boring situation to another.   Percy was trying to write about despair, and in that he was a success. The reader feels terrible despair each time another page is turned. The end of this dreadful novel cannot come quickly enough.   I realize I might well be missing what others admire. My loss, I am sure. The book failed to move me.   Its  not for everyone. I do not wish to disparage those who like it. Many regard it as great. I do not 
 This book provides a great overview of all the different ways a DJ can position him/herself in the marketplace. Of course, they leave out the newest opportunities like retail stores, cafes, and restaurants and instead concetrate a lot on being a mobile DJ for parties and weddings. You're way better off getting a book that specializes in one type of DJing and spending your time and money pursuing that 
 Definitly not worth the money. I thought it was poorly written and really did not have any new informatin in it that was not in any of my basic text books. Quite disappointed 
 Nobody questions that Feynman was one of the great physicists of the 20th century.  (In my lifetime perhaps only Gell-Mann was more accomplished in his results of physics).  This review, however, is not about Feynman the physicist, but rather Feynman the author of 3 textbooks, which purportedly try to teach physics.  At this he has categorically failed for a person that initially knows very little physics 
 These pants did not look good on me.  They seem built for thin people.  While not obese, I am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me.  The material is nice, though 
 Don't bother.  Characters are lifeless, plot is boring, can't believe her first book is a best seller.  Maybe it was just pure luck 
 I was very disappointed in the quality of this DVD.  I would not recommend anyone buying this DVD until the quality is back to that of a professional recording 
 This book was thoroughly horrible. I hated it. It was extremely boring and according to my standards, it wasn't well written. Even all my friends hated it. It was either too sad for them or was just plain stupid. Personally, I recommend you don't get this book but it's really up to you. *sigh 
 Much of the writing is beautiful and evocative, but it's hard to know what's going on.  The summaries posted here have more "plot" in them than is easily gleaned from the book.  Because the stream of consciousness leaps from character to character, it's hard to know the relationships let alone see who is flirting with whom and why it matters.  You do figure it out but it takes too long to figure out which characters go with which names.  There is a lovely portrait of an English village in 1939, and the heartbreaking innocent pageant of English history portrayed, but really, you can get such atmosphere from the series Mystery-- and there you get a plot as well.  I think this is not a good introduction to Woolf, as it takes certain kinds of experimentation and heightens it.  At least with Mrs. Dalloway you see things for the most part from one point of view and come to care about it.  I enjoyed this, but then I'm in theatre, so I enjoyed all of the description of the pageant.  This is a little bit like reading the equivalent of a home movie, it's pretty, but you don't know the people portrayed well enough to really care 
 Maybe i'm not as cultured as some of the people who rated this book, but i have read the likes of Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott and i think it is safe for this to be a true review. Please, please don't put yourself through the torment of reading this book, it is probably the worst book i have ever read. It goes on and on about the littlest of details which don't have anything to do with the book. I read this when i was 11 and it is safe to say i wasn't too immature to read it. Everyone in my class read it and i'm pretty sure we all had the same opinions, it really sucked. I would tell you the worst part of the book, but that would ruin the story. But let me just tell you a little tip, don't read it. Don't read it, don't read it, don't read it. I tried to read it again last year and i couldn't put myself through the pain and torment of reading the worlds worst book. Don't waste your money or waste a part of your life reading a book about nothing 
 The concept of the unit is that you can use your house wiring as the carrier for the signal. The problem with the design is that it cannot overcome the physics of electricity. Netgear does not clearly explain that you cannot push the signal past the homes breaker system in their ads and hence the only way this system works is if your router is on the same circuit as the adapter. New homes break up room/equipment loads into smaller circuits for safety virtually stopping the use of a system like this. My complaint for netgear is that this is not put out there as a significant technical consideration. Although I continued to use their router I had to go wireless to make the system work and wasted money and time getting to the solution 
 I am not sure where to start with this movie, or this persuasive visually essay. After all, that is what it is. Anyone who states this movie is entire fact, despite political stripe, is really not being honest with himself or herself. Many of Michael Moore's arguments and positions on topics really follow a "1 + 1 = 3" formula. For instance Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with the Bush/Gore 2000 election. How different news channels weren't displaying solidarity with the results of the election. Then the film states how Bush stole Florida from Gore. How did Bush do this? Well his brother Jeb was the governor at the time, which is how! Now I am not saying that isn't shady, and I was living in Florida and voted in that election, I recall how crazy that entire process was. But you know how this entire situation could have been avoided? If Al Gore won Tennessee (his home state) and Arkansas (President Bill Clinton's home state, after all Gore worked with him for eight years). Had Gore won these states, he wouldn't have had to worry about Florida! Nevertheless, jolly old Michael Moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film. I know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it shouldn't have been made. My response to that notion is "If you are that upset GOP, make your own movie."   As for President George W. Bush, I have a question. Is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself? Because I find myself getting really confused, I am not sure how he can be both. I imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent, not to be stupid. Consequently, President Bush seems to be both, as ominous as Hitler, but as dumb as Porky Pig. I am confused, but I think that is the ruse behind Moore's mix message in this movie.  I want it to be understood I don't think Bush is the brightest crayon in the box, but I don't think the fault of the world is his pratfall. It just isn't one person who makes decisions in government; any college level course will explain that information to you. There are many shadowy and dark figures in American politics that are both Republican and Democrat. These factors fall into every element of contemporary America.   As for 9/11 itself, what a terrible thing to happen to any country, the fact it happened in New York City was unspeakable. I am able to say I had been to the WTC before and after the attack. Seeing the aftermath was quite moving, to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain. As for the human-interest story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping, was touching. However, what about every soldier's family who had to deal with a death related to the War on Terror? Not just in this current war, but in every war that was ever fought? The bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time. As I write this, I feel conflicted, but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing. Was that mother's pain fake, no? Was her son not a hero, of course he was. But every war has a casualty, which is why it is war. And for every mother, who is upset her son/daughter is involved with this war, there is another mother/father who is pleased her son/daughter is defending the United States. I think Michael Moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe, what do you think?   I suppose I understand Moore's plan, blame people here in the United States because after all if Al Gore were president we wouldn't have terrorists, right? If Al Gore were president we would all have better public schools, lower taxes and no crime, right? Finally, if Al Gore were president there would be no plot against the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, in regards to blowing up public airlines? Right? Remember that the WTC was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists, when Bill Clinton was President. Just some food for thought.  In modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want. Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people.   In conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV. This movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills. The problem with this country isn't Bush, Michael Moore or the War in the Middle East. It is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next American Idol, not the next American President.  
 The author writes about saffron the way I cook with saffron - sparingly.  The book was probably 70% autobiography and 30% saffron.  There were times where I would finish a chapter thinking, "Where was the saffron in that?"  I'll probably only ever read one book about saffron, and it was a mistake to have it be this one 
 Let me sum up this software "total junk"  Pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help, then $25 for the next call.  They give you free email support, but answer everything but your problem.   They try and blame it on Windows XP, and will have you reload Windows.  I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.   Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.   Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.  They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.   This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.    This program should be called "Crash after Crash", and the only thing that works is the hat.  If you feel the urge to waste $100, and hours of your time, just buy this product.  Look at the reviews on Studio 10, and the other Studio products, and most only have one star.   Out of over 100 reviews over 95% had one star.   I found one with 5 stars, but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee, or share holder in the company.   He wrote a 1 star review on a Sony competative product, and 5 star reviews for other Pinnacle products that you would not own if 10.5 worked 
 I am conservative on most issues but I do have some problems with our strategies in the Iraq war.  I have a very liberal friend who is in love with the term "Neocon".  He is constantly critizing me for reading "right wing" propaganda so I said I would give his idea of a great book a try.  I read a little over half of the book and I couldn't take it anymore.  I found myself dreading getting back to the book each day, to me this is just a liberal antiwar hit piece.  There are some good questions in the book on our strategies and troop deployment.  But the author's hate of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Rice take over and cloud every chapter.  He makes the Neocons sound like Dr. Evil's Chamber in the Austin Powers movies.  His referencing was always from the far left blogs and publications, he constantly referenced conversations that could never be substantiated.  My friend told me this was a historical book, apolitical, I think not.  Read it if you want to, I couldn't get through it.  Ann Coulter is an idealogue, but at least she is funny 
 "He Knows You're Alone" isn't exactly an apt title considering most of the kills take place when the victim has at least one other person close by, but I guess "He Knows You're Somewhat alone with Other People in the General Vicinity" doesn't have quite the same ring? Right off the bat we learn the identity of the killer, so there is no mystery, which is fine if we are looking at a flat-out slasher with a high body count. But "He Knows" doesn't really come off as a straight slasher flick, it feels more like a mystery film. The body count is low, the special effects are limited, meaning very little gore. Quite a bit of the film is taken up by Don Scardino and the guy who played the principal in "The Breakfast Club" trying to find out when and where the ever-sweaty murderer will strike next. I would have been more generous in my review if there had been either a higher body count, or if we got to see more of the red stuff flow. My guess is, if this came out in theaters today it would have a PG-13 rating instead of R.  I thought the acting was pretty good for a B-Level flick. The comic relief ex-boyfriend/morgue attendant guy was not annoying like most 80's slasher comic relief guys. And I am sure I am dating myself here, but when one of the actresses in the movie puts on these huge headphones and settles down on the floor to jam to some tunes with some.....refreshments. That took me right back to my High School days. I remember doing the same thing many times...only my head didn't later end up in the fish bowl. So for nostaligic reason I had to give this at least 2 stars 
 I bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that I never got past the first 20 minutes.  I am not a prude, but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective, verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff.  I put the video in my recycle box.  Maybe it had some substance, but I could not get past the first 20 minute 
 This story definitely did not seem age appropriate.  This book is recommended for children ages 3-8.  Two of the pigs are eaten in the story, which can be disturbing to younger children.  The size of the text is enlarged during the times when the wolf is being `bad' or danger is being introduced.  That is a good way to allow the reader to raise his or her voice at these times while reading, but again, that can be scary for a child to hear.  The colors in the illustrations are a bit dull to set the mood of the sad, scary story in my opinion.  The plot is alright and somewhat easy to understand and follow.  But I highly do not recommend reading this to young children.  They would not predict that the pigs would be eaten and that the wolf would be eaten at the end.  A way to use this book in the classroom would be to read a few other versions of the three little pigs to the class and compare and contrast them.  Have the students work in groups to formulate similarities and differences of the characters, plot, setting and more 
 Seriously , miles davis's music for me , i only can use one word to describe it : boring !! its just my personal taste , like hear some of his record , i cant really feel anything that will touchs me , charlie parker famous for his technique , charles mingles... cools orchestra setting , bill evans... great harmony and chord.  But Miles Davis ?? i just cant found any element that will makes me like him. kind of blue is not bad , but i just dont think its classic. 
 Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  Unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  This shoddy technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books.  We are also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  Without these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  As if this isn't enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  In spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  This novel, as well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption 
 Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.   My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here 
 When Ezra Pound, one of the top 150 poets ever to have been born in Idaho in the mid-1880s, was an impressionable young man living in Venice, his application for a job as a gondolier was turned down on account of his being "a miserable, skinny little runt."  That hurt.  A lot.  Young Ezra knew that however much he may have looked like a beta-male weakling pansy-ass poet with curiously bad hair, deep down he was a man's man.    Rather than lie down and spend the rest of his life having sand kicked in his face, Ezra took action.  Here's what Ezra did to prove for all time that Ezra was The Man:  1. Ezra spent the rest of his life ranting against the Jews, who were responsible not only for the corrupting the world's financial system, but also for making him a sad, lonely mediocrity with curiously bad hair.    2. Pretended he understood Chinese, Mycenaean Greek, and Middle Etruscan.    3. Gave money to talented people in return for being allowed to hang out with them.    4. Chopped bits out of The Waste Land, a good poem by another person, and left other bits in for no discernable reason.  TS paid Ezra a compliment at the top of the poem, but Ezra couldn't read it because he'd exaggerated his Italian skills and was too embarrassed to ask what it meant.  Tragically, Ezra died in 1972 without ever knowing that TS had said something nice about him.    5. Wrote the Cantos, a Big Poem by a Big Man.  Don't listen to the nay-sayers: in quality this poem is somewhat better than The Divine Comedy by the Tuscan poet Dante, but not quite as good as "Open Up and Say Aaah!," the classic 1989 album by Poison, GODS of hair-metal.  It's that good.  If The Cantos seem to you like a catastrophic train-wreck of bogus-profundity produced by an unhinged wannabe try-hard skinny guy from Idaho with curiously bad hair, that just means you're stupid, not Ezra, OK?   
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 We've had this foam mattress topper for a couple of weeks and it's OK but nothing special. It does not significantly improve the comfort of the bed, nor provide any improvements in sleep quantity or quality 
    A Virtuous Woman is a book by Kaye Gibbons and is about a woman named Ruby Pitt who meets a guy named Jack Stokes one day when he spots her sitting at a picnic table. She was much younger than he was and was raised much differently than he was.Ruby was a widow but ends up married to jack.Jack was so in love with his wife through everything they went through even when she was diagnosed with cancer.They were opposites and when Ruby dies Jack is lost without her.They seemed to have an unusual relationship in my opinion. It was actually really hard for me to keep reading each page as i went on.It just wasnt a story that kept me wanting more!and that is why i gave it only 2 stars. i didnt even want to finish the book and that is why i think it took me so long to read it.It really dissapointed me seeing as how i loved Kaye Gibbons first novel, ELLEN FOSTER.i think that another reason i didnt enjoy the book is that there were too many characters to keep track of and it made the book a bit confusing.i really didnt like the transition of chapters either. it was a bit unorganized.There was no action in this novel and i'm sad to say that i dont reccommend it to anyone really 
 I was shocked at how bad this CD was. I absolutely loved Mars & Venus so I tried this one. First off he is just talking in a monotone voice that is very boring. It's impossible not to think about other stuff. He doesn't give any useful information, just dances around stuff leaving you confused. The meditation stuff was so lame I about quit right in the middle of the program. Gray struck gold with Mars & Venus but I'm afraid with Get What You Want he struck rock bottom 
 Never in the previous book did it lead one to think there would be a sequeal. This was it and it was a dud 
 Very disappointing, the only good thing in it is the food. It's terribly condescending and author's ego is all over the place. But the most annoying part is that while it claims on the back that this is a book about a cooking school and anyone about to open a small business should read it, this is not the case at all. She only talks about the school a bit at the beginning and then we are just left with her life, her view of the French, which is not very exciting, and an awful lot of adjectives 
   I give it 5 stars for being "complete" (i.e., The idea of having services for every holiday and every day of the week in one volume is wonderful). Ultimately, however, I give it 2 stars because: This paperback edition is totally useless to me. If you need reading glasses and are thinking of ordering The COMPLETE ARTSCROLL SIDDUR (paperback edition), make sure to visit your eye doctor and get those bifocals before this book arrives!  The description of this ARTSCROLL edition uses words like "clear"...and "crisp type..."... but it is only clear and crisp if you can read miniature words or you have young eyes that haven't gone through "the change" yet!  
 Bigoted and racist title for a book about talented blacks, their deserving of a more honorable title since they were called these racist nicknames all their lives and had to be these stereotypes to show their talent, but he can get away with naming a book as he has this one because he's Black, I'm sure if a white did the same, the NAACP will jump on him. Bogle suppose to lift Blacks up not put them down.  Here's a long but informative review! Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness. Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.  Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?   Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.   Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.  I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial. Because I would commend these women, embrace and make the world embrace their beauty, courage, and talents; their many gifts to the world isn't as nearly written about as their skin tones are. He loves spending time writing about how light, dark or mulatto someone looks. Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.  There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy. http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/ninamaemckinney/ 
 Since I am a nurse and doula amongst other titles, I figured I would see what this book is all about and I must say that I was very disappointed in it, including the tv program that was based on this book. This book reminded me of going to a hospital-based childbirth education class, where it only gives you one side of birth- the medicalinized way or no way at all, with intervention after intervention.  It did not describe at all any of the pain management techniques other than medications, nor did it describe or mention homebirth or birth center options, or even doula support.  If you want to know all the current info out there, this book is definately not the one to get. 
 Please don't waste your money on this agenda-driven, ill-informed book. Anyone who tries to convince you that climate change is not a serious and potentially catastrophic problem is either delusional or receiving funding from the oil industries. There are dozens of much better, more persuasive and well-researched books out there: James Gustave Speth's Red Sky at Morning is a good place to start.   Just because something is comfortable to believe,  legitimates your current lifestyle, and doesn't ask you to change your habits of consumption does not make it tru 
 Silver Ravenwolf has crossed the line between fiction and fact yet again. This book is littered with historical inaccuracies, and as always, what Silver wants to be true will be true in her books. She tries to interprete all of history and spirituality in one sweep of words, and I must say, it is extreemly shallow. She shows no respect for any tradition, except her own misguided versian of Wicca. Although she borrows a lot of her information from Christianity, she continues to subtly blast the Christian religion, in her attempt to make money, by writing about subjects that are vastly beyond her comprehension. 
 "A long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish. Not just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean."  This is a book I have some trouble with.  It is beautifully illustrated, and the glittery silver scales make it very appealing to children. However, I am not entirely sure it is sending the right message. I like to give the author the benefit of the doubt that he meant well, that the overall message is that vanity and posessions will not make you happy.   But ultimately the solution to the Rainbow fish's problems give unclear messages, and can possibly be interpretated that to make friends you need to buy them.  Other interpretations have been covered comprehensively in other reviews and include possible biass towards communist values and a want for sameness 
 Mr Dahl claims he does not intend to propose changes to the Constitution, but, rather, changes in how we think about it. Since he appears ignorant of his subject, I find him unqualified to suggest either.  Howbeit disrespectful of the powers of the States - and the people's rights as citizens of the States - the Framers were, they still knew of those powers and rights, and much of what they did and said - and what they did not do or say - was affected by that knowledge - a knowledge Mr Dahl either lacks or disrespects.  Many of the faults found with the Constitution share a source: the fact that many powers that have been arrogated by the "federal" government belonged to the States, at the time of the Constitutional Convention. The franchise, for example, was defined and controlled at the state level and the central government had no business trifling with it. Slavery was a matter of property law - a body of law over which the central government had no power. (Indeed, the amendment eventually adopted as the fifth prohibits expropriation except as accompanied by compensation or due process; even with compensation or due process, the property must be taken for public use - an eventuality unlikely to appeal to the average slave of the time.)  The time to discuss this separation of power - this check on central power - was in an early chapter of Mr Dahl's effort, and he failed even to hint at the power of the States, let alone to comment on their importance in balancing the power of the central government.  While Mr Dahl's book may have a certain curiosity value, to those who need to know how not to write political history, I found it worthless to anyone with an honest interest in his stated subject 
 Almost bought this in the store until I noticed there were case studies for both Win2K and WinXP. These are very similar operating systems and, sure enough, the text for the chapters is exactly the same for most of these two chapters. I do not understand why  interesting operating systems [FreeBSD, Mach] were left online in order that these two redundant chapters could be printed. Were it not for my familiarity with previous editions, I would assume the authors knew very little about OS concepts if they thought that covering 2K and XP would provide two distinct case studies for comparison. In short, the 2K coverage should have been replaced by one of the online chapters 
 I was surprised to see that my grandmother, who has never spoken ill of anyone under any circumstance, who saw only the good in everyone she met and would give the shirt off her back when she had nothing to give, was completely villified by this book... because she is a christian. I dont think i have ever been more pushed towards christianity than by reading this book. 
 I thought this book started very strong; it set up everything very well, and i could start to see the themes emerging from the work. But then the author decides to have these long-winded conversations with herself that are very hard to follow. She uses hyphens instead of quoation marks to represent dialogue. The major problem with this is she combines more hyphens when she breaks away from conversation to describe how the person is talking or to depict a scene taking place. Sometimes she doesn't even bother to start another paragraph when the dialogue starts back up again. So this results in a very confusing read as it's hard to tell if someone is talking, or if it's a scene, or could it be how they are talking, or is it an aside, or is it just a thought, or maybe this is a convo, and who is talking again, oh, maybe she is describing the surrondings....?   It drove me Crazy 
 I bought this book mainly on the recommendations of other reviewers.  That was a mistake.  The book is a dull gleaning from unacknowledged secondary sources.  Lots of more or less accurate names and dates, but no depth analysis at all.  Style?  Try this: "The feeling that the arrests were a criminal act of unapralleled dimensions were felt at the time."  If you still want the book, don't buy it.  Let me know and I'll give you my copy 
 This latest entry in the Nuala Anne McGrail series by Andrew M. Greeley is a big disappointment.  The main plot line promises more than it delivers, both in the solution and how the answer is found, and the secondary plot line wouldn't be a puzzle at all if the characters simply read faster.  When the book doesn't drag it can be annoying.  The sex scenes and discussions thereof are not as steamy as the author seems to think they are; overall they struck me as sophomoric.  The voice in Desmond's head (carried over from earlier books) appears only sporadically and not to great effect, and Nuala's ability to "see things" seems to have some convenient gaps.  There are hints of possible post-partum depression or some such that are neither developed nor resolved.  I found it difficult not to just skip to the end to see how things turned out; but honestly, having read the whole book, I don't know that I would have missed much by doing so 
 First, this is certainly not a Pro book, it should be `Idiots guide' or `Step by Step' Second , the author does not have a style in writing , also is repeating things unnecessarily , mentioning things that does not relate to ADO.NET like discovering planets and Isaac Newton , things he thought funny but just waste reader's time  I recommend Programming ADO.NET 2.0 applications by Glenn Johnson , a much better book than this one. 
 Simply put, I didn't like it. Emma Thompson was too old to play a 19 year old. Not only did the movie leave out a/o change alot of what was written in the book the movie left out a/o changed the characters. So, once again I must say, I didn't like it.. 
 This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK 
 Generally well written prose, Evan's "The American Century" is rife with examples of his left-leaning tendencies.  Throughout the book, every Democrat is described in noble and glowing terms.  Errors made by the liberals are explained away as casual mistakes or honest misunderstandings.  Democrats are universally portrayed as virtuous and well-meaning.  Conversely, all Republicans/conservatives are shown to be mean-spirited and their policies are donation driven and designed to hurt the "average" American.  I understand that every historian writes with a particular bias, but the totality of it here makes the work unreadable to less idealogically-driven readers 
 The audio book was supposed to be unabridged, however there are several sections missing.  Including the entire section on the Salem Witch trials 
 David Laskin's journalistic and scatter-shot approach to this group of significant American intellectuals is disappointing.  The emphasis is on anecdotes rather than motives, psychology, ideas, or works created.  The book is lightly documented, and if you already know anything about the  individual writers or the movements they were part of, you'll look in vain  for new insights.  It's certainly readable, but because it treats the  subjects with so little context, the reader wonders after a bit why one  should care about these folk, who sound more like a bunch  of dysfunctional  celebrities of the nineties than the  defining minds of  a complex and  fascinating historical era 
 Catalan is a difficult language to find audio lessons. I'm going to Barcelona in a couple of months, so I wanted a disc to learn some basics while I drive in the car . Apparently, the only way to use this audiopack is to read the book at the same time. It is not concise. It does not repeat basic information like numbers. It is truly not for the beginner. I suppose I'll use it to hear the ambiance of the language. I've looked into purchasing a different software pack from another web site 
 Another jingoistic, poorly theorized work of fiction. There are countless of these cheap "doom-and-gloom" scenarios. Save your money and play Command and Conquer: Generals. Because really, that is all this book is, another fantasy videogame reading "end-times."   There is absolutely nothing inevitable about a clash between China and America. Neither state has anything to gain from such a clash, nor does China have any reason to overthrow American hegemony. China is greatly benefitting from the Pax Americana without paying the costs of this system. If aggression occurs, it will be due to inept American foreign policy.  And on a final note, Bush has made it quite clear that the U.S. military will not support Taiwan if it were to formally declare its independence. 
 Typical story of the woman who gets dumped by her husband for a more exciting woman.  This one bakes bread to "heal" and meets another guy and Yupee every thing is super again...  
 Hmmm .  . . How can a complete unaltered version of a book originally published in 1979 contain references to events occurring in 1993?  The only thing that made me believe that this book could have been originally written in 1979 or earlier was lack of use by the author of cut-n-paste technology, resulting in character development scattered in the strangest and most inappropriate places.  I agree that it wasn't altered - and should have been.  Why give it two stars?  Because I saved one star in case I come across a book worse than this one 
 I really wanted to love this book. It came strongly recommended by a good friend who is very interested in development work.  Whenever I read a review I always try and figure out what angle the reviewer is coming from, so for the record I'm deeply interested in development work and I have a background in economics and environmental science, but mostly I'm just really well read.  The book immediately starts off on the wrong foot when Sachs, for some reason, decides to set 1820 as the base year for determining world poverty and decides that in 1820 the world is universally poor and on an even playing field. In doing so, he ignores European colonization of virtually all of South America, All of North America, and most of Africa and the resulting poverty that occurred among the indigenous populations as they were thrown off the best plots of land. He brushes aside the argument that colonization had a great deal to do with the rapid development of the west by pointing out that the colonies economies grew even during colonization. This is true, however, there's a reason for that: the colonizers had installed local populations. Some of the money was staying put, the vast majority was going to the "mother country." He also cites longevity statistics (40 years in Western Europe) and says that applies globally and says that disease was a major problem. Prior to the European settlement of the America's the people were taller, and lived longer than their European counterparts. They also didn't have any of the Western Diseases (small pox, measles etc) because they lacked beasts of burden and the population density of Western Europe. Anyone who starts off a book playing fast and loose with History and with Economic theory can't be trusted to create an accurate model; and it's true. His model is riddle with flaws that other reviewers have pointed out. People like his theories because it absolves them of developed world guilt and makes the solution seem easy without much in the way of self-sacrifice. Like too many economic models, however, reality and the ideal are not the same 
 I knocked this book from someone that ordered it, but got to the store after me :-).  I made the mistake to buy the book by the sound of its title.  And author.  I fell for it this time..... It is not the first Konstantinos text I buy and must say, this one helped me make up my mind.  It seems highly obvious that the author is abusing the commercial value of the "black arts" to get to the spectrum of rebellious teenagers that would "sell their soul" just to make a statement at large.  Well well, if that aren't following the routes of the christian church we so dire to critisize.... The practical aspects are not well thought through and I suspect, just as unknown to the author as to the guys that made the front page.  Practise is either made as difficult as possible, or serves as an example of the inability of the author to explain some basic concepts. It does show that the author is jack of all trades, but master of none. I would advise readers that are seriously interested in the topic to acquire the texts of Frater U.D., which I find much more fascinating, as well as educational.  I would therefore advise this text for any pseudo-black-art-wannabe with little interest in the occult.  
 For an 800 page novel, it was surprising how sparse the story was.  The premise was interesting, and based on the first hundred-odd pages, I thought I was in for a very good read.  Unfortunately, 'Passage' turned out to be less than thrilling.  There's no doubt Willis has an engaging style - how else to explain why I sat through page after page of endless plot repetition?  She's easy to read; her prose is clear and flows well, and it was clear to me that the constant traipsing back and forth through the maze-like halls of Mercy General by her characters was a sort of uber-metaphor in a book about NDE and metaphors.  And that's just it - it was clear to me after the first few dozen pages - why keep hitting the reader over the head with it?  Additionally, there was absolutely no character development.  Hell, there were no real characters to begin with - you can't make a five-course gourmet meal out of a cardboard box and a turnip.  The characters were merely mouthpieces to expound an interesting, but ultimately boring, theory.  You might even say the characters themselves were only metaphors.  The relationships between the characters are totally undeveloped, with the exception of the protagonist, Dr. Lander, and her friend Maisie, a little girl in ICU waiting on a new heart.  But even there, the relationship turns out to be - guess what?  That's right.  A metaphor.  My last gripe is not so much with Ms. Willis or this book itself as it is with the marketing of the book.  When I pick up a book in the science-fiction section of my local bookstore, I expect to read a science-fiction book, which 'Passage' is clearly not.  It's a metaphysical and philosophical exploration, sure, but absolutely not scifi.  Based on the strength of her writing ability (after all, I DID read an 800 page book about nothing), I'll try one of her other works, but I won't hold my breath expecting something fascinating 
 I do not quite understand why this should be a recommended Buk-Book. It is a fairly interesting interview, alright. But if you're going to spend money on Bukowski: buy HIS books. And if you want biographical information, go with Howard Sounes. To get a real good look on Bukowski you also might want to check out the 'Bukowski-Tapes' - Film-Interviews by Barbet Schroeder. Pivano's Interview reveals nothing new is not really worth the money 
 Women in Love is a well acted film mostly about people who are difficult to like doing things difficult to approve.  To its great credit this Ken Russell film is faithful to the D. H. Lawrence novel upon which it is based 
 This lecture is full of worthwhile information, unfortunately the audio quality is so terrible, the microphone isn't working correctly, that it is almost impossible to hear what he is saying. On top of this his speech is slurred due to his age. I doubt that Bucky would have found this product to have any integrity. The producers really should have a statement advising people that the quality is terrible. Buy one of his books, but don't waste money on this CD 
 First off I belive that this would have been better if written by Greg Cox. Mr Hanna has probably only seen about 2 minutes of an episode because in this book he makes Sydney seem weak (which we all know she is not), He didn't really give the main Charater much to do since she had was injured and what got on my nerves the most was that he had Sydney call Vaughn "Michael" (which she NEVER does) and has people call Dixon "Marcus". For a second when I was reading the book I had to think of who this "Marcus" was. So overall this is a book that you can skip. You won't be missing anything.   
 I have a friend who loved this book...but, for me, anyone who suggests hot dogs and Splenda in a diet book is off my list 
 I found this an interesting book, but not that believable.  Ryall claims to be describing a family tradition (famtrad) of Wicca not connect to Gardnerian or Gardnerian derived Wicca.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to hold water, and most people who know about the subject don't believe her claims.  Still, it is an interesting read 
 This DVD gets only 2 stars because the 4:3 TV screen format of this DVD production is really ridiculous.  But the movie is one of my favorites, number 4 on my all time best movies list. The feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70's sci fi movie (like 'Andromeda') than of a 60's movie. Austere and unemotional (like Colossus himself), quietly and punctuously narrated, minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain, as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world. I like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens, LED displays, printout terminals etc. Really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60's. And captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings. ATTENTION! SPOILER! The movie has no happy end, the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end. Just as it is in D.F. Jones' novel 'Colossus' on which the movie is based. And that's another reason why I like the movie so much - one of the few movies WITHOUT a forseeable and boring happy ending. The absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending, by the way, contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer.  This movie almost has the quality of a Kubrick 
 This movie stunk. I hate this movie. I should throw my copy out the window. I should pee on it. The way you shake it i cant beleive it you make my pee pee go badoing doing dump 
 I found this book to be boring and unoriginal. Also, I'm not much of a scientist but I don't really think you can make a planet travel through a wormhole 
 The author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the Chamber of Commerce or a right-wing think tank. Like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. In his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. He is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. He finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. His low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. Most in the West do care. Rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment.   Though the author's real target is US society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. And of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. A country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. But it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the US.   In the US, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. In actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. In this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. He contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. It is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at Wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. The actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the Wal-mart juggernaut.   He especially decries direct citizen actions. He is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. However, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. It's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of Congress to accumulate vast sums. If citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. The theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as American as apple pie. His view that such unelected bodies as the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve Board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. Who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the Fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? No, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it.   If the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. First and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. It is not surprising that Americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. The list could go on. Informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. The US most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. This is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore.   It is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. Americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. Yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. The book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.  
 Neruda is far and away my favorite poet; his poems are passion, love and sunrise put into words. That said, and being familiar with the poems in this collection, I found the translations lacking, to say the least. Several of the translations add speed-bumps to otherwise perfect poetry. It being Neruda, I wanted to love this collection, but after multiple attempts I came away with the sense of seeing a beautiful woman, poorly dressed and poorly represented, too much make-up covering her natural beauty. Pablo deserved better. 
 I bought both of these books and really hoped they would be good.  I saw him the day before on TV.  Well the books came and I should have returned them because the ingredients are not realisitic. These are not things that I would ever have on hand.  All of the recipes are strange, I doubt I will ever cook one thing from them 
 This book aimed to sell on its claim to fame which hinged upon the juicy account of the lives of 9 femme fatale who purportedly launched the careers many great men in history. This book sucked precisely because these "juicy" accounts teetered toward tacky sensationalism; the writing no more refined than tabloid-style prose; and the manner in which the author attempted to connect the unconnected lives in a bid to justify the publication of the title was incoherent and done in poor taste. The book is an eye sore and an abomination...avoid it at all cost 
 I don't trust this author because of all the bad press over his other books. Picked this up in a bookstore and it looks like any other toilet training book. I'll go for an author with more experience in childrearing issues just to be safe. 
 Typical Feinstein ("A Season on the Brink" excepted).  Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc.  This book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long Island.  The subtitle, "Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black," is used here as a figure of speech, meaning "behind the scenes."  ("Inside the ropes" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.)  Feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion.  We see U.S Golf Association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf course.  Yet the book does not fulfill its promise.  My guess is that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis I had hoped for 
 The point that both sides miss: There is no where in any of the scouts aims, methods, programs or awards where it discusses homosexuality.  God, yes. Sexual preference, no. Just leave scouting alone.   
 This is an interesting book and the drawings are lovely. However, you don't know what you are looking at since the explanation plates are way way too tiny to read. You'd have to take the pages and blow them up to read what is drawn. Instead of 4 plates to a page how about each plate to a page. Don't buy if you are trying learn about the horse because you can't read the tiny tiny print. 
 We used this Lonely Planet guide book on a recent trip to the US and British Virgin Islands as well as Explore Virgin Islands by Pariser. We learned about both through online reviews and bought both on Amazon.com.  Pariser's book was better; the maps are easier to use. his tips on how to get along with the locals were informative. We wanted more on the ecology from lonely planet, but turned to explore virgin islands for that. All in all, Pariser's guide had more info not found elsewhere 
 I just want to slap who ever keeps coming out with these.HARD.Okay,there are some song that deserve this.To be ruined by off key 10-year-olds with annoying high squeaky voices.But come ON!They KILLED 'My Immortal'!That is a beautiful song!I'm listning to it as I write this!And also,little 6-year-olds cannot properly appreciate it!And,let's face it,'My Immortal' is not exactly a kiddie song.I mean,do you want your little 4-year-old boy listning to 'Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams,Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me,These wounds won't seem to heal,This pain is just too real,There's just too much that time cannot erase'?  Please,STOP BUYING THIS CRAP!Not only do they ruin the great songs of our generation,but they also put on some really innapropriate songs.I mean,come ON!Go look up the lyrics to 'Toxic'!That is DEFINATLY not a good song for little children.  Of corse,the only reason any child would like this is because their older sibling listens to it.Then someone should sit them down and explain why this is NOT for them.  Die Kidz Bop 
 I might have enjoyed this movie more if they hadn't gutted the book, which was a pretty good read. The best character in the book, FBI Special Agent Pendergast, isn't even in the movie, and New York City police Lt. D'Agosta is just a comic caricature of the book's character.  Another criticism of the movie is that almost every scene is so dark you can hardly see anything. If the purpose was to create a moody, scary atmosphere, they went way too far.  See if you must, but don't expect too much 
 The pictures in TR:3055 sre horible.  There is only a few good IS mechs'.  All the clan desighns are bad.  If you fight clan or IS, don't buy it 
 I, too kicked myself for falling for the marketing hype that surrounds this mediocre book. As others have noted, the text is uneven, hints a multiple authors, and is based on little more than repetitions of various ideas from pop psychology and the current interest in law of attraction systems. Feel-good platitudes abound, but little else of any depth. The book has, unfortunately, about the same level of subject depth as an average website.  On a related topic, this book is an example of a very damaging trend in the publishing industry. Publishers can be wooed into printing a book entirely on the strength of the author's "platform" rather than any qualitative judgement of quality. If you have a big enough mailing list, and you can get a bunch of friends to write good Amazon reviews (see the early reviews of this book), you can get a book published no matter how poorly written.   The bright side of this is that I now recognize the techniques used to activate this so-called platform. In the future I will not fall for it 
 The Premium Vehicle Power Charger was not compatible.  I returned i 
   I can honestly say that the D20 Modern is a playable system. There are several key oversites in the engine. With the introduction of an entirely new wealth system (purchase DC) the authors have sidestepped the complicated issues of dealing with a credit system. While this has it's advantages for the game designers, it has left players who wish to deal on a cash basis entirely out of luck. There are no real world prices listed in this book, or the supliments for d20 modern. This means that players wishing to work with a traditional money system are faced with creating their own prices. There is a conversion table listed in the book, but this table is broad in it's range.  There are several other issues within this slight deviation of the standard D20 system that leave the player fealing like they have purchase a watered down version of Cyberpunk. All in all, the system is still very playable but I am certain that many more in house rules will be in effect where D20 modern is being played 
 My son and I worked on this think for a few minutes a day for 9 days.  After dealing with countless breakages due to a design flaw (the foundation cannot support the weight fore and aft), we finished.  As I picked it up show the Falcon to my son, it fell into three pieces.  I tried to repair it and more pieces fell off.  The more I tried to repair it, the more it kept falling apart.  I am convinced that without the use of model glue, it will never stay together long enough to snap a picture of the completed project.  How a child is supposed to play with this is beyond me.  It would cause far less trauma (and a lot less money) if you would go and buy your child an equivalent number of Legos and let them use their imagination.  We've been loyal Lego purchasers for 12 years now.  I will think long and hard before I purchase another set like this one.  Do yourself a favor.  Don't buy this product 
 Sangean is known for high-quality shortwave radios.  I assumed this quality and the reviews would help me break into HD FM.  I wish I had read the last review in this section before buying it.  The only good thing about the unit is that it does give clear reception for HD stations whose normal signal is fraught with signal degredation.    When listening to quality FM (non-HD) signals that are crisp and carry excellent frequency response and separation, this unit renders it as almost monaural and AM quality.  I couldn't believe it!    For FM stations (again non-HD) that are weaker, the unit further reduces separation and frequency response to give a quieter result.  This is non-defeatable, so you're stuck with it.  My boom box sounds better.  On another note, it offers many presets, but you can't surf through them.  You must press a "Preset" button and then the number.  If you are listening to the FM2 presets, you have to use the "Band" button to cycle through AM1 & AM2 to FM1 for those presets.  Very clumsy!    The only good thing I liked is the simple faceplate for others that may want to use it.  In summary, I was going to Ebay my Onkyo FM tuner for this one.  NO WAY!  I am seriously considering returning this tuner.  Read our lips.  Verrrry disappointing if you are a discriminating listener of music.  There is a reason that the other HD receivers are expensive.  Now I know. 
 This is the first DL book I've actively debated not finishing. This book made the Jean Rabe books seem great by comparison to this monotonous tub of dung.   The beginning was slow and written with an excruciating level of detail, internal monologue, and bouncing around from past present and future in reference to Galen being a little brat and getting around punishments for his behavior.   After the first few chapters the bouncing around was ditched...thank God, but the monotony of detail and internal conversations continued or even increased.   I suffered through this until page 160 or so last night. I'm considering skipping the rest of this book or at least just jumping to the end to have closure on this crap I've read so far (something I've never done before with a book, especially a DL book!). I'd much rather read Kaz the Minotaur I think!   ~JoE~ 
 I hate the fact that this "group" has "made it" simply because some a-hole at the record company never heard of "Massive Attack." I swear I gave this album a good-hard listen: just me and a pair of headphones hoping for something new.  What I heard was a girl who has a good voice, but lends that voice to some of the dumbest recycled lyrics that I keep hearing over and over on the radio. (now, the radio isn't bad, but aren't you tired of hearing the same lyrics re-arranged to a different peice of music?) It also wouldn't be so bad if I didn't already love Massive Attack and never heard of them. SERIOUSLY go listen to "Mezzanine" From Massive Attack and tell me that Evanescence isn't HEAVILY influenced and to a point copying them. Don't just rip my review just because "I LOVE THAT SONG THEY PLAY ON THE RADIO" go get Mezzanine, sit in a dark room and just listen. You'll see that I'm right. also, the album cover? please. come up with graphics, or something. I hate ego maniacs that put their damn face all over their cover. 
 This CD is fun and musically intriguing, but not appropriate for kids... one song talks about "what can you do in a case like that but stamp on your mother, and your toothbrush, and on everything that's helpless." Another talks of being an immigrant to the country and says "and they beat me, and they banged me, and they left me on the ground." And another says "I'm a great sharpshootress. There is nothing that I can't shoot in the eyes, or the ears, or the teeth, or the fingers." Musically it's fun and goofy and intriguing, but I was appalled when I realized what I was encouraging my young child to listen to.  
 I have been a Nicholas Sparks fan and I was very disappointed with this book.  Too predictable, very depressing...  
 Interesting how Netanyahu already had "terrorism" on his mind while his buddies from Israel in the PNAC think tank were righting that the foreign policy they wanted to pursue in the Middle East (ie ethnic cleansing of all Arabs) would not be possible without "a catalyzing event like a 'new pearl harbor.') Man did that prediction come true! What insight these Zionist warmongers have! Oh and don't worry about the 5 Mossad operatives who were caught high-fiving each other while filming 9/11 as it happened who were dressed as Arabs, failed a lie detector & whose van tested positive for bombs. And nevermind the fact that Netanyahu said that it would be "very good for Israel" immediately after 9/11. (This is sarcasm, you should be concerned about this and look into all of it and more.) The towers were brought down with explosives. Read this book only to know your enemy, these guys had a plan for us and we're in the midst of it today it's called total destruction. All for Zionism, all for the Jewish state. Our government listed to Netanyahu & his friends alright, they listened all too well 
 When I bought this book, I didn't know that I would have to be able to read music fluently in order to use it. I would NOT have bought it. I am working on reading music, but in the mean time, I still want to grow as a player from the books that I buy and read. I believe that the author should have included TAB. Not only would he have reached a larger audience, but it would help players to learn how to read notation! The book does include a CD and the tracks sound nice. 
 There are almost no illustrations of the movements described in this book.  There is some good information but I think they are assuming you are already an experienced coach and have seen all these complex movements they talk about.  if you are a novice looking for some detailed descriptions of the training movements, along with pictures, this is not the book for you 
 I bought this coffeemaker as replacement for my Starbucks model that I accidentaly damaged. Unit stop working after a month. Quality and taste of coffee could not compare with my Starbucks machine which unfortunately is discontinued (I am not sure who built coffe maker for them, now they sell Kitchen Aid and Delonghi) I took my coffeemaker to local authorized repair shop. They told me that this is nonrepairable model and that I will receive replacement in 4 weeks, I even had to pay $12.50 for shipping. Its been more than 8 weeks, deLonghi customer service will not deal with customer and repair shop told me they are out of stock and there is nothing thay can do about it. Most of electronics stores have 30 days return/exchange policy and if your unit fail within this period, return it and buy something else. I did not do my homework since I did not consider coffemaker purchase to be major one but after reading horrible reviews about this product I would like to warn future customer of making same mistake 
 I found the content of this book to be excellent, particularly for older children. That is, until I got to the last page or so. As an educator of children with autism I found the ending quite disturbing. The sister in the story explains autism very sweetly to the girl, then takes the girl away from her brother to play with her herself. The book seemed to me to indirectly teach children that if you come across a child with autism it is best to ignore them because they have no interest in you. A much more appropriate ending would in fact be to have the sister teach the girl how to interact with her brother appropriately 
 "He was cringing, fighting the straps with amazing strength. His hands turned red and then white and the cords of the neck stood out like steel bands. The force of the electrical current was so powerful that his eyeballs popped out and rested on cheeks.  Finally, he caught the fire. His brain was boiling."  Shocking?  This is the description of the sufferings of prisoner being electrocuted.  In U.S.A.  In XXI century.  Taken out of context - what does it say about Americans?  Is that a true picture?  
 I know I'm in the minority here, but I found this album to be uninspired and disappointing compared to their album " A Place In The Sun ". The musicianship is fine but the material is mostly lame . Whereas 'Sun' contains at least three songs worthy of release as singles , 'World' only  has " Love Will Find A Way " . Don't expect a song by song review by me because I only listened to it once in the summer of 1978 . The  best memory I have of it is how I wished I could have returned it for my  money back . I'll very charitably give it two stars . " A Place In The  Sun ", an album by Pablo Cruise that I very much like, beats it hands down  
 Like everyone else has said - the controls on this dryer suck! If your fingers are at all wet or greasy from product, it is a struggle to flip the switches. I don't know if the ionic feature did anything or not. I suppose I'll know once I compare it to the replacement I'm about to buy.   I had the dryer for about a year...and now it's gone. As I was drying my hair last week I noticed sparks shooting out of the nozzle! Yikes. I cleaned out the filter and the sparks stopped. It lasted maybe 3 more uses before it just went dead. No smoke, no fires, just nothing. I expect a longer life from a simple appliance like this. Back to Target I go.. 
 There are many aspects of the T5 people want to count as negatives. For me I consider them annoyances but not killers. I would like to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it. More memory is always good but the T5 isn't on the hurting side. It's not a good mp3 player with the memory it has. And even if you have a 2G card with mp3's it's not like this is what you would buy for MP3s. But as far as contact information, on the go applications etc.. I would consider this as good as any other. The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die. I haven't heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die. It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not come back to even a factory state. You will have a Palm Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top.   There are a couple of fixes. If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to make it better. Or you can remove the battery and solder it back. This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for.  Until I ran into this I would have rated this a 4/5. Until this happened the device did what I expected it to do. I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi. But it has one of the fastest processors (available at that time) in a PDA. Which was a different type of cool. The bluetooth works well enough I haven't had any issues with it. You can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn't really that big of a deal.  But if you can't trust your device is going to be working the next day it really  doesn't matter what cool feature it has. This has been a very expensive let down. I don't want to buy another Palm after this experience but I am not sure what to switch to... 
 "have you forgotten" is just another attempt by a country music singer to cash in on the 9/11 tragedy...another "toby keith" wannabe who is using the incident to jump start and career and sell cds.   Someone said this song was a career risk.  Give me a break! This is the kind of song country music fans will buy, but make no mistake about it was written to start a career.  It would have been more of a risk to write a song against the war and be a country music artist.  
 these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this 
 As a parent of 3 boys who love Star Wars, we are constantly purchasing books.  We have always purchased them at Borders (or stores of the like).  This was the first time I purchased a book on-line thru Amazon.  Within ONE MONTH the binding came unglued.  This has never occured with any of the other Star Wars books we've purchased.  My boys are very protective of their books and take care of them.  We now have a book with the hard-cover off and I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and due to this do not plan on purchasing online thru Amazon if this is the quality I am to expect in the future 
 It's very good, and I only give it one star because my teacher ruined it for me.  She analyzed everything Arthur Miller wrote in it, whether the lights were to be dark, or bright, how he shift time, how the instruments played, believing symbols of all of them.  Contrary to Arthur Millers own statements which I printed out and gave to the class, that he didn't plan on anything, he just wrote.  Let people do with it what they do.  In that affect, the teacher took a great play, and ruined it with her ideas of what he meant.  
 yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that "tub thumping" is okay, even if it "gets old after awhile". that song is CRAP!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. EVER! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.  that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song) makes the strongest argument AGAINST ANARCHY that i've ever heard. proves that people who can't agree on anything can't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme.  gotta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel 
    I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.  At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was "okay to be gay", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly. I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.  Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life... 
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 I didn't think this would be a bible study book!  If you're not into reading bible quotes on nearly every page, bypass this book!  Felt like I wasted an afternoon 
 This book by Stan Larson does present an interesting story of Ferguson, a lawyer who had a hobby in archaeology. However, Ferguson was nothing more than that - a hobbyist in archaeology. Indeed, his historical and archaeological method would make many of those trained in these areas blush. Indeed, his cointribution to the Book of Mormon was minimal, if any, even when he did write favourably for its antiquity, such as the errant books, full of errata, he did with Bruce Warren.  The real "meat" of the book lies in the so-called archaeological tests for the Book of Mormon. However, Ferguson's tests are often times ignorant of the Book of Mormon, are contradicted by modern scholarship, and even ethnocentric. FOr example, bellows are mentioned as an anachronism in the Book of Mormon. However, bellows are only mentioned in an Old World context, not a New World context, in Bountiful (probably Wadi Sayq in Oman) in 1 Nephi 17. Bellows have been found in areas in the Old World pre-dating the Book of Mormon volume, so any charge of such representing an anachronism is a non sequitur.  Furthermore, "grapes" are mentioned as an anachronism. However, types of grapes have been known to be native to ancient Mesoamerica, as botanists have noted, and are referred to as "vitis." Again, the mention of grapes in the Book of Mormon is errant.  Much more could be said about the mistakes contained in this text. I would suggest one to read John L Sorenson, "An ancient American setting for the Book of Mormon" (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Books, 1985), as it deals well with the issue of Book of Mormon material culture, and in an even more scholarly manner than Larson does in this text, as did Ferguson who he cites.  I welcome sincere feedback at Robert.S.Boylan@nuim.i 
 In our opinion this book is a poor excuse for scholarship. The seminal work by Harry Oldmeadow on this same subject shows what a scholarly work should be - thorough, balanced and properly sourced. Interesting that Oldmeadow isn't listed in the Index.   This book appears to rely on hearsay and an incorrect understanding of Traditionlism to concoct a sensationlist work that is a marketer's dream but a true scholar's nightmare. 
 Everyone loves Rose, the first narrator of this story and the central character in the book.  Her mother loves her, her first husband, Sister Evangeline, her best friend, her second husband, and her daughter.  The only people with any real reason to love this woman are her mother and daughter, both of whome she abandons completely to work as a cook in an unwed mother's home for almost no pay for 15 years without a vacation or ever having dinner at home alone with her family.  She is completely unlovable in that the only feeling she ever expresses is toward her mother.  She says she misses her everyday.  So why does she never go back to see her before she dies?  Why does she never share with her the granddaughter that she took away from her?  Rose's idea of fun is to drive aimlessly, rent a hotel room on the coast, sit on the bed for five minutes, and drive all night to be home to the husband she doesn't love by morning.  It's idiotic.  Apparently this episode was so much fun to Rose that 15 years after it happened she relates it to her daughter as oh yes, it was so much fun.  Sounds like a blast.  She can't even carry on a conversation, much less show any tenderness or affection.  It makes the people around her who love her so much seem ridiculous.  Son can barely stand to go into the kitchen at St. Elizabeth's after she leaves because he misses her so much, even though she never considered his feelings at all when she named her child Cecelia against his wishes because it held such a painful memory for him, and when she left him to go live by herself in the small cottage.  Also Sister Evangeline confides in Cecelia that she misses Rose so much she can hardly bear it.  Why?  She was a humorless, inconsiderate (to put it mildly), cold-hearted bore.  Cecelia is the only one totally frustrated by her mother, as she should be, but even she accepts her behavior in the end.  It was a well written book that you thought might lead somewhere but went absolutely nowhere, like Rose.  When she leaves you wonder what new relationships is she striking up that she could not care less about now?  I won't read Bel Canto or the Magician's Assistant.  This book was foolish in the extreme and completely pointless 
 Neiwert tries to be two things at once -- a storyteller as well as an advocate for hate crimes laws -- and the result is a muddled effort. He interweaves the chapters with social science discussions of hate crimes and ongoing news of the trial. In addition, he repeats himself (especially the trial portion), and the book feels padded. The story itself is no more than a long magazine article, and the characterizations of the main two actors are thin. As a courtroom drama, the story lacks suspense. 
 This book was a reading for my 3rd grade daughter.  I have no idea how or why this book EVER won an award, unless it was for being the most boring yet deppressing book ever written.  And the illustrations were just as sad 
 This is one of those catch-all biographies that attempts to throw in everything including the kitchen sink and fails in all regards.  The author, D. J. Taylor attempts to connect Orwell's writings with his life but spends so much time on trying to find little kernels of truth in the authors mundane diary entries that he accomplishes almost nothing.  Since Taylor has no ability to write critically about Orwell's works he should have focused on the details of Orwell's life which are easier to record.  Also one gets the feeling that Taylor isn't a fan of Orwell's writing and has little simpathy for his weaknesses in character. So why write the book 
 This sounded like a good book, judging by the reviews here, but being relatively new to the Oracle world, I haven't found this book terribly useful so far.  Oracle's docs have been much more helpful and detailed. I was hoping for a book that shared the author's experience and tips and helped the reader make decisions, but this seems to be largely a command reference, covering many topics superficially.  
 This book reads like an encyclopedia of random shortcuts of keystrokes to cut down your use of clicky buttons.  I found it very difficult to just read from chapter to chapter because of the format the information is published in, an assembly of brief descriptions of tasks, one after the other.  I couldnt just start at page 1 and read to the back cover.  I'm not sure if the Mac verson of photoshop shows the shortcuts in every menu and mouse-over like the PC does so I cant speak for them.  But pretty much every function that has a keystroke shortcut on the PC has that keystroke noted.  The tips in this book were for the most part useless to me because over time, I've learned the shortcuts that were the most used by me.  I dont recommend this book to anyone but a beginner with photoshop.  The cover price of the book does not justify the few tips that could be useful.  Replace this book instead by memorizing the shortcuts as you see them in the menus and try the help function in the program itself.    EDIT:  I purchased this book because I loved the authors book titled "down and dirty tricks".  I definately recommend that book instead 
 This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion.  The character development was weak.  The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention.  If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first.  I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series. 
 Dull and inane come to mind. Consists mostly of Peabody's artificially "catty" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of Egyptian "archaeology" (...). The plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. I found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. Avoid it 
 I am lawyer from Brazil, and wanted to get real information about the green card application process (without having to go through the dry explanation in the INS website) and was completely disapointed and upset when I received this book.  It does not cover anything in depth, and wastes a lot of time talking about temporary visas, fiance visas (I thougt it was supposed to explain about greencards!), special greencards for amerasians (which is not a very common situation)...     As for what I was really interested in, which was the green card application process for work-related reasons, there is a small, incomplete paragraph and a suggestion that I find an attorney!!!! Waste of money, useless -- if you want to get a green card, either find another book, check the INS website, or hire a lawyer, this book will not help at all.  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 The only reason I wanted this CD is for Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. However March of the Toreadors immediately follows it. I see that it was arranged in alphabetical order but I wonder if it wasn't also a cruel joke. I now am conditioned to have my nerves jolted every time I put in the CD and listen to the Moonlight Sonata 
 I found useless this book. I returned it 
 I'm on my 3rd v-180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it (under warranty) for another.  Unfortunately, they have the option of sending you a refurbished model, which means that they tried to fix someone else's problem phone and pawn it off on you. This one is going to get flushed as soon as I find another phone to buy, since Cingular says it's now out of warranty and I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months 
 I purchased this book for my daughter who has loved every other Karen Katz book we've bought her. This book however is NOT about sharing. Instead, this book teaches children that they don't have to share, but just offer another one to their friend so they each have one. 
 While I didn't utterly loathe this novel, I found little to recommend in it. I read the occasional Romance Novel for diversion, and they almost always disappoint on several levels. Since this one is in the "inspirational" genre, I was hoping for a nice romance with the entertainment value of a historical drama, some romantic tension, and no sleazy sex scenes. What I got was 1) no drama, 2) no tension, and no "sex" at all... not even a stolen kiss. Somebody please buy this author a copy of "What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew...", and then perhaps her ensuing endeavors will have even a smidgen of historical flavour. The characters walk around slinging 20th century slang like "hi", "hello", and "OK" (well, the last one appeared in 1838 in reference to Pres. Van Buren, "Old Knickerbocker", but it wasn't in common usage as an affirmative until WW1). The female lead is referred to as having her hair "down her back": what?! Is she five years old?! Is she a prostitute?! Believe it or not, this is supposed to be 1839, but I wouldn't have known without reading the blurb on the back of the book. At one point another female character, who is only a few months pregnant, asks her husband, "Am I starting to show?" Excuse me? This is '39, waistlines are only just starting to come down from just under the bustline and are still very high, surmounting voluminous skirts. Think Little Bo Peep: very Dickens. Unless she's a "loose woman", she should be wearing stays (a corset), too. She's not going to "show" until about month eight, at which point she just won't go out in public. But enough on the historical gaffes.  Did I mention no sexual tension? Sorry, but I call "no way". I'm a Christian, Bible thumping believer myself, but I still have hormones. I don't care how chaste a person is, he or she is still going to have some serious "feelings" when meeting the significant other of their dreams. I'm glad the leads didn't jump on each other ten minutes after meeting, but does it have to be such a yawn festival? Does the author think nobody had "the hots" in the 19th century?The leads are so tortuously boring that there isn't even a kiss of any kind until after the wedding! Look, people "made out" in the 19th century, ok? It was done in private (unlike today), but people is people.  Perhaps the author thinks that it's "Christians" or "Believers" (as she terms us) who are free from sexual temptation. You'd think so, judging from the pompous, stuffed-shirt goody-two-shoes Christians populating this story. We can't go more than a page or so without the entire transcript of somebody's heartfelt prayer or sermonizing to either a fellow believer or seeker. Only a few pages into the first chapter, I was already irritated with the over preachyness of the writing. It's like reading a novelization of a Chick tract, complete with 20th century "Church speak" guaranteed to befuddle or exasperate anybody outside the "Christian ghetto". Which begs the question of the target audience for this book. If it's for believers, why all the preaching and salvation messages? If it's for a wider audience, with the hope of presenting the gospel to random readers, the Evangelistic jargon needs to be revised and explained. When somebody says "I'm saved by the blood!" it probably sounds like a Vampire moment to the uninitiated.   A few years ago I read an outstanding "Christian" romance (sort of) named "Pascal's Wager". I highly recommend it and would read anything by that author. Lori Wick can't hold a candle to it (pun intended). 
 Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up "bricking" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon 
 I sat through this entire film even after my wife begged me to turn it off and then stormed out of the room to watch TV in the living room.  She was bored to tears and felt that the premise was unbelievably stupid.  Little did she know, I completely agreed I just have this thing about only seeing part of a movie.  I had to finish it, even if I knew I was gonna hate it.  To me the idea that Anthony Hopkins could be a black man is so unbelievable that I couldn't even begin to concentrate on the meat of the film.  I understand that the novel is acclaimed and everything, and everyone, even critics feel that this film is loyal to that novel, but if that's the case then the novel can't be that great.  If they had chosen another actor I could have believed it maybe, I mean, I have light skinned black friends and I know they could pass for white, but when they tell you their black you can see the features...Anthony Hopkins is whiter than I am...and there's no way I could pass for black so Hopkins is out.  Really if it weren't for the excellent acting on the parts of Hopkins, Kidman and Harris this movie would have no redeeming qualities.  So here you have it, young black man looks white, realizes it's easier to just play white then be who you are, he disowns his family to live his life easy, he becomes a teacher and now in his 70's he's accused of being racist by the people who think he's white so he starts an affair with a much younger woman whos drunk husband wants to kill them both, and he does, and then his secret is exposed to this guy who wants to write a book about him.  I just had such a hard time getting over the idea that some idiot thought Anthony Hopkins could be black that I can't even see this movie for the good that it is.  I'm sorry; this review is probably so tainted it's not even funny.  For all I know this is a great movie, I mean even the premise is something I would normally really enjoy it's just so hard to get over...I'm rambling...never mind.  Like I said, I really tried 
 Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead 
 What a huge disappointment and waste of money!  Janet Evanovich should be ashamed of herself, and I'll know not to buy any book by the co-author, Leanne Banks.  The 2 primary characters fell in love way too fast and for no good reason.  The only reason this rates even 1 star is because there was some mildly amusing dialog here and there.  "Pugg" should have been named "Pigg" because he was a disgusting pig and not at all likeable.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  I can't say it enough 
 I am a big fan of Westerns.  I like old and new and I am always eager to watch something different.  This was a TNT original movie and as such my rating would be 4 stars which is to say better than most TV movies.  However, by comparison to theatrical releases this movie pales and I can only give it 2 stars which is being kind.  I loved the cast, but the acting was surprisingly bland.  The script was not bad, but neither was it engaging.  The action was weak, especially the shootout at the end which was edited poorly.  The only thing I found that the movie had going for it was an insteresting premise which halfway through the movie had already grown old.  When I see 4 and 5 star ratings and I think of all the great classic westerns, this just doesn't measure up.  Open Range, a Kevin Costner Western that is just a few years old shoots circles around this one.  I recommend watching this one first before purchasing, I wish I had 
 Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer. 
 I hope Cornwell gets professional help for whatever motivated him to author this.   Rychlak's book "Hitler, the War, and the Pope" needs to be read if you choose to read this one.   Law professor historian Ron Rychlak(nonCatholic) has shown proof author Cornwell was biased and telling lies, starting from the front cover of "Hitler's Pope".   That cover picture story is interesting and demonstrative of Cornwell's penchant for manipulative tactics to get the result he wanted. The building in the cover photo is the office of both the Weimar government and later Hitler. Go to the UK Amazon site and notice that the cover photo for the same book is different than the cover on the American Amazon site. They both naturally were the same(they both were the UK cover) when the book was originally published, but the surprise phone call by Rychlak to an American radio show Cornwell was on, not only forced Cornwell to then alter the photo, but change the inset text that described the photo. But Cornwell still apparently couldn't help himself, he still was manipulative, so instead of eliminating the photo he carefully eliminated the parts of the photo and blurred the other parts that proved it was not a visit to Hitler, but to the Weimar government - Hitler's rivals before he took power. Wow, what a disturbed jerk.  Cornwell was further forced to reprint the book in the US and change the text inside the book falsely claiming that the picture was taken after Hitler gained power.  Some of Cornwell's misrepresentations and falsifications were exposed after Rychlak published his analysis of Cornwell's facts, so I suggest reading what Rychlak has published on the web in addition to reading Rychlak's book. 
 After having bought the first edition and read numerous other Finance & Strategy texts (in addition to having graduated with an MBA in Finance), I think it's fair to say this Grinblatt book is rather superficial in its coverage of technical matters e.g. options, financial engineering etc. and poor in its treatment of real life contemporary issues e.g. M & A, bankruptcy etc. Plus I still can't see what it has got to do with Corporate Strategy. Something is still missing here....  Most of the write-up are kind of basic (i.e nothing oustanding) explanation of issues, concepts or techniques in Finance, which you can easily find in other texts with much simpler names. The title of this book is catchy but MISLEADING. Priced at $120, this is really a rip-off. I just don't understand how other commentors could give a 5-star for this "shoddy" piece of work. Reference manual for corporate boardrooms and Wall Street? Come on! You guys must be joking! No offence but is this what they'd call "cutting edge"?   Compared to classics like Copeland's "Financial Theory & Corporate Policy" or slightly less-advanced Brigham's "Intermediate Financial Management", this Grinblatt book really falls short of the standard and needs a lot of catching up to do. Hopefully, the authors will take serious note of this in their upcoming edition. Unless of course, they still want their book to be just another "appetizer" for business undergraduates....  In short, NOT worth buying. And NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER or in this case its rather appealing TITLE 
 Anil is plastic - if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country, they are hidden.  As someone born & raised in Sri Lanka, I felt the situation could have been explained MORE for the rest of the world.  And SUDDENLY this plastic Anil, who has shown no feelings, no emotion (not even surprise) stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming "YOU are killing us!" - us?  And where does this emotion come from.  No-one is even sure WHY Sailor is dead - was it accidental and meant for another, was he killed by JVP for refusing to go on strike?  Why was a gem-miner killed by the death squads? - nothing was explained.  Even the ending - did Sarath & Gamini just die - was it a dream?  Was it all just a sea bath in the Indian Ocean at Mt. Lavinia?   
 I agree with many of the other reviewers.  This book seems to have been written by a 12 year old boy.  Simplistic, almost cartoonish, plot and character development.  I found it so unbearable after about 50 pages, it went in the trash 
 This book completely ignores the most important nonzero sums of a human male's life which are the amount of women a male mates with and the amount of children a male sires. Ignoring these two sums makes the theory Wright proposes collapse. 
 My 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times.  Our version did not include the "5 ways to play" as stated on the box.  (I've requested a copy from Briarpatch.)  My 4 year old - who received the gift - lost interest after the first time he played.  Both of my boys LOVE the "I Spy" and "Can You See What I See" books.  This game just wasn't challenging enough for them 
 I recently found these authors and have been devouring the Pendergast series with great enthusiasm. Having worked my way down the list to "Brimstone", I opened the book with great excitement. Unfortunately I closed it with great disappointment. The book started off with a bang, fizzled in the next 400 pages, and a good 1/3 of the book could have been left out entirely. Much as I want to give the book three stars, the ridiculous plot just won't let me. The plot started off interesting and spooky but when the motive for the murder was introduced, it was so mundane and silly, I put down the book and laughed out loud. After that I had to force myself to finish it.   I didn't like Hayward in "Reliquary" because she came across as a tired, clichï¿½d feminist (act tough and swear like a man to get accepted).  The subplot involving her and the equally tired, clichï¿½d "Christian nut cases" was so dull it should be bottled and sold as Valium. Eventually I skipped over all those chapters as they lent nothing to the main plot. The abrupt, exceedingly premature office sex scene between Hayward and D'Agosta was unbelievable from numerous viewpoints: 1) no sexual tension had been allowed to build between them. The sex simply came out of nowhere and was thrown into our faces with all the subtlety of a gorilla at the dinner table. 2) the idea that a "by the book" female police captain would risk her career by having sex in her own office while on duty with a co-worker just didn't ring true. Oddly, the relationship was then dropped until the final pages.   Agent Pendergast, whom I have adored previously, was the only thing that kept me reading, and even he was allowed to go so far off the deep end (he deduces the entire murder motive from a piece of horsehair - Come on!) that he lost the endearing characteristics present in the earlier books. Even the attempt to introduce Viola as a love interest for Pendergast failed (they looked into each others eyes for a breathless minute - PUH-lease!). Please guys, no more romance. Stick with what you do best and leave the romance to Danielle Steele. 
 If there's one band which has given INXS a run for their money in royally screwing over their heritage following the demise of their charismatic frontman, it's Queen. The posthumous album Made In Heaven, the Ben Elton musical and Godawful appearances with piss-weak boy band 5ive have already decisively battered the memory of the `70s rock institution, with this latest piece of tosh another head-scratching addition to the list. A chiefly American line-up attempt reinventions of classic Queen tunes, proving that Metallica, Travis and Homer Simpson's versions of key Queen moments weren't so bad after all. Eleven's version of Stone Cold Crazy adds interest due to Mr Joshua Homme's additional trademark guitar fuzz, Jason Mraz offers a touch of Mercury to his delivery of Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy and the cast of We Will Rock You bring their lifeless version of Bohemian Rhapsody to the table. The normally stellar Flaming Lips similar struggle with the epic Queen hit, playing it far too safe to create anything as groovy as their White Stripes cover from earlier in the year, while Joss Stone (still in nappies when Mercury joined the great gig in the sky) seems thoroughly bored by Under Pressure as she mumbles her way through it. Josh Kelley adds a few interesting genre-hops on Crazy Little Thing Called Love and Ingram Hill delivers '39 with a country tinge, but it's too little too late. This isn't a Killer Queen, just a covers collection to send you slightly mad 
 The Osmond family's recordings have been reissued off and on for many years now, mostly in the form of less-than-brilliantly-executed Curb CD's, and have yet to be done right, at least comprehensively hit-wise.  Even after a box set, some of the hits are still not available on CD.  Unfortunately, missing the opportunity again, this piece from Universal Music takes a step backward in that quest.  Though titled "Best of Donnie and Marie Osmond", three (each of which was top-forty so we're not talking minor league here) of the seven charted hits they achieved as a duo are missing, yet two of Marie's solo hits are here.  With a total of twelve tracks, there was ample opportunity to include these missing hits instead of the b-sides and album cuts used.  To further taint the effort here, if the compilers insisted on tacking on Marie's solo hits to this compilation, then they should have used her never-before-on-CD last pop charting hit, "This Is The Way That I Feel".  Compiling these things is not rocket science and while many of the others in the Millennium Collection series are good, basic compilations of most, if not all, of an artist's hits, this one falls flat on its face in that respect.  If you have any of the other D&M collections, you don't need this one.  Beyond the faulty track selection, the execution is decent with good sound quality and all tracks in stereo.  This piece falls way short of its promise and offers little incentive to purchase 
 The book is useful as a reference dictionary of accounting and tax related terminology.  I was expecting instead a listing of deductions as implied by the title 
 Grotesquely dissapointing has a permanment address in the community of white trash cookery, belicose tras 
 Just finished Emily Griffin's Something Borrowed then picked this one up right after...What a difference! Love at First Site is extremely boring right off the bat and the writing style is so painfully unnatural I couldn't make it past the first 40 pages. Griffin's debut, by comparison, is one of the best chick lit novels out there--very engaging with strong characters and lots of romantic suspense. Even if you like British chick lit authors as I do, don't bother with this one by Jane Moore 
 I have previously enjoyed all of Suzanne Brockmann's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction. I have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances, I really hate it. What a yawner and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated 
 I just had to counter the person who gave this 5-stars. I'm sorry, there is just no conceivable way to classify this as music. First time I heard it I was waiting for the punchline but it never came. I wish i could give it 0 or negative stars. 
 I LOVE Elizabeth Berg.  While this book was not her best, the story of the people about whom this was written was really amazing.  I just felt the book was boring, and I think it lacked Berg's wonderful prose and poetry on life.  I think she made one reference to life being like fabric on a sewing machine, slipping out of your fingers, or something like that.  I always love her comparisons like that, and this book did not contain much where I said "Wow - she is SO right!"  I also don't like books from a child's point of view.  I'm 41 and want to read from a woman's point of view.  If this is your first Elizabeth Berg book, do yourself a favor and go read something older by her.  She really is wonderful, and I look forward to her next novel 
 This book is a good buy if you live in California, Washington, New York or Floridia or if you are Jewish, elderly or disable or any combination of any of the above listed. I live in Illinois and there was NOT a lot of information for people living here(well not a lot of info. that one who lives here doesn't already know about). If you have the chance to get this book from the library before you buy it, I would suggest that you do so, then you decide 
 eh.  i was dying to read this after geography club (that book rocks) but this one....like i said...eh.  it was campy.  sigh.  i guess campy is is a bad metaphor considering that we are talking about gay kids at camp, but i can't think of a better one.  the only good part was the love triangle between russel, min and a bisexual fellow camp counselor.    the burn victim metephors were too much.  i mean, come on...burn victims facing a forest fire????  how imaginative.  let me guess...russel saves the day?  oh, that's right, i forgot, i read it. 
 I listened to "Piece of Mind" religiously for almost two years.  It never left my disc changer.  "Concious" has two or three notable songs.  But it does not have the consistency of "Piece of Mind."  She seems to be aiming for commercial success.  She does not take as many risks with this one and there is too much filler.  
 Don't waste your money. After 18+ months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life. Instead of updating to a newer phone, accompanied by a new 2-year service agreement, I opted to purchase a "new" battery. Waste of money! The new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means I must re-charge nightly. That was the same predicament I encountered with the original battery - nightly re-charge. 
 Versailles by K. Davis represents a stream of Marie Antoinette's consciousness and very often I got lost. This fascinating character could not be captured in 200 disjointed pages...some prose, some dialogued in the format of a play and some babble. I found the book annoying and put it down forever after 144 pages 
 I love love love this movie, but you have to make sure you get the VHS version (where the VHS cover is the cast riding in the car.) Lucky for me, this is the one I own. By mistake, I purchased the "wrong" version for a friend and we sat down to watch it together. The music in the DVD version is TERRIBLE compared to the original (don't even get me started on the c.d. soundtrack.) Whoever made the blunder of re-doing this for DVD re-release needs to be fired 
 i bot the book and later subscribed to its Bigtrends newsltter service and i had the worst experience ever in my whole trading career. I wrote to them several times for problems i had in its service and i received no replies. They charged me upfront for thousands of dollars and no refund despite cancellations after two weeks.  This is one newsletter that i would not recommend...trust me ! there is no customer service at all ! 
 THIS IS THE WORST SONG I LISTED TO IN MY LIFE  IT SOUND LIKE A BANRE 
 I have always enjoyed Johansen's books but they are getting pretty predictable with the female protagonist and the male protagonist at odds with each other, building into an obsession and her finally succumbing to his charms. Its the same story with her other female protagonists as well. Other than a little different type of killer, these stories are as redundant as a Victoria Holt gothic novel and I gave those up many years ago for the same reason 
 Like much of mainstream American music, Hootie & The Blowfish have found their groove and settled in a little too well.  The songs all sound nice, but each bleeds into the next much too easily.  I would mention standout tracks to try, but when songs barely deviate from their comfortable formula of an easy tempo and the same damn three chords... Close your eyes, point, and try a sample song.  If you like the thought of 12 tracks of it, you'll be quite pleased with Looking For Lucky.  As for myself, I think I'll look elsewhere 
 Giving you a brief rundown where I stand, I thought Part 1 was pretty good; part 2 had some interesting things about it; I didn't much like Part 3; part 4 started to pick up the pace again; part 5 was surprisingly good; I think Part 6 was arguably the best; I didn't like part 7. This 8th chapter was a little better than part 7, but that is not saying much. The story begins with Jason being brought back to life with the help of electricity. (This reuses the technique from Part 6, but it doesn't bring back the same impact.) Jason claims his 1st 2 victims and then makes his way to a boat full of teenagers heading towards New York. Here, the story starts to lose credibility. At least Part 6 made sense when he headed back to Crystal Lake: "Jason will return to the area that's familiar to him. No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him." (So, in this 8th chapter, why does Jason go out of his way to board a ship heading for New York?) I know some people thought it was interesting to see Jason aboard a ship, and that it added something to see Jason's potential victims trapped on a ship. I admit this is a valid defense for the movie, but my question is: "Why did Jason go out of his way to board this ship in the first place?" Moving on, one of Jason's possible victims is a fairly well developed character (Rennie) who has a tragic past with water, and has hallucinations of Jason. Alright, I admit this is one interesting thing. Rennie's uncle Charles is not exactly the nicest person. (But unlike Dr. Cruise from Part 7, at least Charles has some redeeming features. At times, his concern for Rennie seems genuine; when Sean's father is killed, Charles takes a moment to offer a bit of sympathy; and at times, he is concerned over the safety of others.) Another interesting character is Sean (the son of the captain). He wants to please his father, but feels he will be unable to become the captain that his father is. However, becoming the captain his father wants him to may be the only way to save at least a few of the people on the ship. Alright. Another redeeming feature. Moving on, there is the typical high body count, but 5 people manage to escape to New York City. Unfortunately, they run into 2 thugs who rob them and run off with Rennie. (Another redeeming moment for Charles is at least he shows discretion in trying to rescue Rennie.) Naturally, it isn't long before Jason arrives in New York City. Another problem I have with this movie is: "Why does Jason go out of his way to hunt down these 5 people in a whole city?" At least the previous movies made sense. Early in Part 2 we learn that Jason will take revenge on anyone who enters his territory again. And in Parts 2, 3, 4, 6, and even 7, at least Jason was staying in his own domain attacking anyone who happened to be there. To be sure, in Part 6, Jason did attack some people away from the camp grounds, but at least he was on his way back to the area that was familiar to him. Moving on, there was one other element I had to admit was somewhat redeeming. We all know Jason is a brutal killer, but in one scene he is portrayed as almost heroic when he unwittingly saves Rennie from the two thugs that kidnapped her and were trying to rape her. (Interesting twist I admit.) I'll admit it was comical when 2 of the last 5 people screamed for help because they were being chased by a murderer, and a waitress could only say: "Welcome to New York." And of course, in a typical Friday the 13th fashion, 2 people manage to survive the massacre and come out alive. I'll admit this isn't the worst Friday the 13th. (That honor is shared between Parts 3 and 7.) I'll conclude by saying that this 8th chapter does have some redeeming moments, and you may find it to be an interesting twist. But you have to be willing to swallow some things that aren't consistent with the rest of the series. If you're willing to do this, then you will probably will enjoy it more than I did.   
 Hammerfall is one of the bigger names out there in the power metal world, and this cd sounds pretty much like the previous 5 albums. The only dofference is that they have gotten worse. I write this review to the two groups of people out there: The exisiting Hammerfall fans, and those trying them out for the first time. For already existing Hammerfall fans such as myslef, I strongly urge that you do not buy this cd, unless it goes below 3-4 dollars on amazon. For those looking to try Hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first time, go ahead and get this one, because Hammerfall are by no means bad musicians. They can all play very well, but this cd lacks refinement and creativity. Start here and work your way up to the better Hammerfall, which you will no doubt appreciate more. Hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over and over, if you know what I mean. All of their songs sound relatively similar, but this cd marks one of the lowerest points in their career 
 This was my first -- and last -- Cat Who book.  I bought it because I needed something to read at the beach, but found it so inane that I went for another swim instead.  Having spent money on the book, I felt obligated to eventually finish it.  I kept wondering when I would discover the plot, but alas, the book ended without one.  I had hoped to read a mystery story, but the only mystery -- the body found on Qwilleran's property -- was never developed.  Another reviewer called this book a pastiche -- a quite appropriate word.   Want to write a book like this?  Here's how...  Take a small town newspaper, cut out stories at random, then stick them together.  Throw in a rather silly single male journalist who spends his days wandering in and out of other people's lives, writing corny sayings and then attributing them to his cat (I thought Koko was supposed to be smart!), eating in restaurants, and traveling between his various properties 
 Soft core porn masquerading as art, I didn't even make it through the first half hour of this film. Lola's cute, but it's still not worth the effort 
 Like other readers, the book grabbed me and pulled me, dumbstruck, into Lucinda'a life. I thought her boss was hilarious; I could feel her excitement about leaving to live in Prairie City. I could actually SEE every character, hear their voices; I could smell the fields and taste the wine. But I left Lucinda and company the day Mason killed the kittens. Lucinda says, everyone knows you cannot save an hours-old kitten... Of course you can, I mean it is possible.  I worked at an animal  shelter and did so myself. I understand the work involved but there are people you can call to help, especially if Prairie City was as involved in social issues as Lucinda would have us believe. So, I never finished the novel, only read the ending after the kitten incident. There were strange things overlooked like the fact that Mason's daughter still wore diapers and slept in a crib at age four and that Mason thought deer would be interested in Lucinda's left over hamburger.  Alot of what went on seemed phony and forced. Yet, I loved the last paragraph and the realness of Lucinda's letdown about her life. And I believed that this place of pain was a springboard to a more compassionate life 
 Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to.  I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care.  Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation.  just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared.  Lithium, anyone?  I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up 
   Maybe I am naive, but I think if a book promises total self-confidence, it ought to deliver.  This book does not deliver.   I admit, any book making these kind of claims would have a tough time delivering on them, but the main reason I am disappointed is that the ideas espoused in this book are hardly original.  Instead, his ideas range from cliche' statements lifted straight from Dale Carnegie ("be a good listener", "let the other guy know you are impressed with him") to the purely metaphysical, such as "whatever the human mind can conceive, it can acheive" (now, pardon me for just a second while I use my mind power to get out of this wheelchair).   For somebody with absolutely no self-confidence, these tips are good to start out with, but for most people they will simply be common sense.  A reader should expect a lot more from someone who has a Ph.D. in the subject. 
 I'm a big fan of young adult fiction, but this book was a total disappointment.  It was written from a 15-year-old's perspective, but felt unreal (and I remember being a 15 year old girl pretty well).  Her world seems to consist solely of one-dimensional, good/bad parents, step-parents, and neighbors.  Her character contradicts herself and is pretty unlikeable.  I just really couldn't really get behind the plot, which is full of improbable dramas.  The issues of race and sex feel forced, (again) unrealistic, and simplistic.   The book just wasn't written well and wasn't even mildly entertaining.  Also, there's some silly graphic designing with upside-down text (don't turn the book around, it's just repetition) and a really, really, really bad choice of font 
 I purchased two units--one for our home and one for our vacation home.  Within a few days, the unit at home was no longer making good crema.  The water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses.  I'm sending both units back and buying another brand.  If they had worked properly, I'm not sure I would have like them even then.  The design of this unit is "odd".  I've had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird.  If you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew, the grounds and steam explode all over.  I also suspect that the thermostat is broken.  It allows the water to boil--which does not make tasty coffee.  Overall, I hate this unit.  I'm going back to shopping 
 I have the Smart Shelving and Storage Solutions book by Proulx and from looking at the Table of Contents of this "new" book on line at Amazon, I believe that many if not all of the projects in both books are identical or very similar.  Most of the photos in the Table of Contents of Best of Danny Prolux Storage & Shelving are the same as the ones in Smart Shelving and Storage Solutions.  I'm sorry that Mr. Proulx finds it necessary to reissue an old book under a slightly different title.  I for one will buy a different book 
 It takes a few attempts to get through this book. I read it through about 3 times before I could understand what the authors point was. It is more of a documentary then anything else. Perhaps he could have ellaborated on the  myths and ledgends, as well as zodiac references to the pyramids. Other  than that, it's an interesting read 
 I ordered what I thought was matcha tea powder. a comment on the page said it was SLIGHTLY sweetened, no specific nutritional info was available when looking to order. on the info when the tea arrived was a calorie count of 393cal/serving, and ingredients which include corn syrup solids and partial hydrogenated oils. not what I was expecting from a green tea powder. would NOT recommend 
 This book is a very old, text style, research paper from 1927.  It is very difficult to read, and rather boring.  It offers a lot of information that the reader can obtain in newer more interesting books.  Don't waste your  money, buy another book instead 
 Director:  D.J. Caruso Cast:  Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, Kiefer Sutherland, Gena Rowlands, Oliver Martinez, Tcheky Karyo, Jean-Hughes Anglade, Paul Dano. Running Time:  109 minutes Rated R for violence, gore, language, nudity, and a scene of sex.  It's no crime to emulate that which is successful. Hollywood 's entire history, for better or worse, is based on studios, producers, directors, even actors, tapping into that which is au courant and using to their own best advantage. It's only when a moviemaker so blatantly rips off another that a hew and cry goes up about cinematic plagiarism (re: Brian DePalma's unabashed love affair with all things Alfred Hitchcock, so vividly on display in such films as "Carrie", "Dressed to Kill" and "Body Double") Even then, while those films can be accused of being rip-offs of their superior progenitors, at least they are good rip-offs. DePalma's brand of obsessiveness appears to have afflicted director D.J. Caruso with his sophomore effort, the new suspense thriller, "Taking Lives", starring Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke and Kiefer Sutherland. Caruso's work reeks of so many other latter day suspense classics (such as "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs"), yet he doesn't appear to have learned his lessons well from the masters.  Jolie is a special agent for the FBI who is called to Canada to help with an investigation into a series of killings that appear to be connected. Jolie's character, we are told, has a special affinity for this kind of work. She's the type who garners clues as to the psyche and motivations of the unknown killer by lying down in the site where a victim was found. Ostensibly, she has some kind of extra sense about serial killers, something known to the Canadian Chief of Police, a former comrade (and possibly lover) of hers when they trained together at the FBI, and a trait that some other, highly chauvinistic Montreal cops (i.e. "Unfaithful"'s Olivier Martinez) don't buy into. Her investigation leads her to a woman who tells police she has just seen the son she thought died nearly twenty years, a young man she admits is very dangerous, a shaky eyewitness to the most recent of the serial killings, an art dealer played by Hawke, and a suspicious and mysterious man played by Sutherland. The police believe they have zeroed in on the killer, who has some connection to Hawke, so they use him as bait, but as is the case with these movies, all is not what it appears.  Director Caruso borrows heavily from the look and feel of such films as Silence of the Lambs and Seven. Much of Taking Lives is shot in dark, dank basements or closeted rooms, shards of light penetrating through cracks in the walls. Dismembered and/or rotted bodies tumble from secret hiding places, dropping into frame right on cue for the maximum on the scare monitor. The problem is, we've seen all of this before, and most people get a weekly dose of this kind of ghoulish forensic foray on television with CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, so the scare tactics never really initiate the same fright sensibility.  The all-star cast does their best to rise above the pedestrian screenplay, but even they are hamstrung by the script's mediocrity. Jolie, putting in perhaps the most mainstream performance of her career, is sensual, sexy, tough and determined, the quintessential female heroine in the mold of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling. Unfortunately, her character has too many vestiges of Foster's, with the exception of the eroticism that simply comes with being Angelina Jolie. Hawke is all nervous ticks and twitches that almost give away too much, while Sutherland, on hiatus from his heroics in TV's 24, gives perhaps the film's most subtle performance, seductively menacing.  "Taking Lives" has everything it takes to be a first-class suspense thriller, but somehow falls short, particularly in the film's climactic moments. The denouement is nowhere near as satisfying as one hope for, the suspense long since having been played out so the life is taken out of "Taking Lives" 
 `Anything Else' reminds me of Woody Allen's earlier masterpiece `Annie Hall' in more than one way - a love romance in New York City, an aspiring comic writer, funny one-liners, jazz songs, and most of all, the choice of the hero/heroine who might or might not leave the city. The difference is that `Anything Else' doesn't achieve the level of humor and pathos of `Annie Hall.' Perhaps the film's soulless touch might reflect Allen's own feelings about the city and filmmaking itself these days, and also explain this strangely weariness of the film that is very disappointing.  Jason Biggs plays Allen's alter ego, young comedy writer Jerry who really wants to write a serious novel. He struggles to make his dream come true for all this incompetent agent Harvey (Danny DeVito) and his frigid girlfriend Amanda (Christina Ricci) who refuses to sleep with him (for six months). Perhaps some viewers would find these characters unlikely or worse, unlikable - and Jerry and Amanda are all living in a nice, clean room together in New York City, and afford to hear Diane Krall singing and stay in a hotel (single room, $200) - well while we are watching these annoying and implausible characters, another irritating person arrives. It is Amanda's mom Paula (Stockard Channing), who 'tries' something new (here white powder) ... like in 'Annie Hall.'  This formula of vintage Woody Allen comedy with eccentric characters might have worked in the 70s and 80s. Actually, there are some funny jokes from Allen himself, playing Jerry's mentor David Dobel, but the film itself, especially the first part, is slow and boring. Fast and snappy dialogues are not to be found, and the character of Ricci, who fails to show the charm of a real coquette, is only irritating.  Actually, the casting itself is the real problem. Jason Biggs is not convincing as struggling Jewish writer, and neither is Ricci as whimsical heroine. I know it is too much to expect from them the chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton, and what is more embarrassing is that Ricci is seen prowling in her underwear, as if compensate the lack of that credibility of romance.  `Anything Else' is definitely not meant for those who are going to watch Woody Allen films for the first time - in that case, he or she would never come back again -- nor for his devoted fans, who prefer his films with romance, humor, wit, and insightful observation about life. It took nearly three years for the film to be released in Japan where I watched it, and now I know the reason for the delayed release 
 My mother and father read this book and it enflamed them against the doctors who were trying to convince my mother that she needed to do something about her Stage II breast cancer.  She was scared to death by what she read.  Perhaps literally.  While she was scared, her cancer progressed to Stage IIIC.  We're not sure she's going to make it.  She received three opinions regarding recommended treatment from some of the best hospitals/doctors in the U.S.  Then the cancer spread to her breast bone area.  She is finally following doctors orders, including chemo, and her tumors are shrinking.  We pray it is not too late.  I'm sure this book has some useful information, but my mother only showed me the scary bits--the things that made her wait.  Too long?  Who knows.  Beware 
 Typical twisted scripture, just like the reviewer Terry J. To try to apply the scripture in Matthew about the blasphamy of the Holy Spirit and calling Benny Hinn a scam artist, it is clear why people like Terry are followers of Benny Hinn. Like most of Hinns followers, they are sincere seekers but have not come to know Jesus, mainly because they put Benny Hinn ahead of Jesus. their lack of any bible knowledge and their abundance of Hinn knowledge is a deadly combination. Seeking signs and miracles is what Jesus calls an evil and adultress generation. Less of Benny...alot less..... and more of Jesus ....thats my advice to anyone who is seeking to become a true follower of Christ. What would Jesus do ???? He would Puke on Benny Hinn and his limos and jets and $1000.00 white suits.....wake up america !! Jesus said many false prophets would come in My name, even performing what seem to be miracles, but they will be false......He said follow ME !!! NOT PREACHERS AND EVANGELISTS !! Jesus dosent need to heal people through Benny Hinn...His sign was ALREADY GIVEN..HE raised from the dead, Jesus said that would be the ONLY SIGN HE would give !! wake up , your salvation is in danger !! Jesus said many will come to me and say "Lord,Lord we have performed miracles in your name...and Jesus will say...depart I never knew you" !! IS THIS YOU, BENNY HINN FOLLOWERS ??? SOUNDS LIKE IT. DONT BE AN EVIL GENERATION SEEKING SIGNS !!! SEEK JESUS ! 
 I ordered two of the items above in error.  I did not think the first order was submitted properly so therefore a second one was ordered and came from Antonline.  I have been trying since Dec. 19 to return the wide angle lens and adapter to them.  I am 71 years old and not computer savvy.  I just wish I could get return labels and my account credited.  They are still in the original packing as received and never been opened.  Thank you for being interested. I was informed by them that my time had expired.  I do not believe this to be true, or does your opening web page not apply to them. 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 Pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought; he mistakes child abuse for some form of "real" child rearing.  I just read his interview in the Guardian UK.   Although it has been years since I have read this book, it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when I think about it.  I have read philosophy from classic to contemporary; I have lived in Japan and practiced Zen archery and Zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of Western AND Eastern philosophy yet Pirgsig, to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon. This is proof that Pirsig remains deranged.  Moreover, in the Guardian UK interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered; Pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son's murder. Pirsig is a perfect example of someone with Narcisstic Personality Disorder.  Pirsig's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother.   If you are one of the poor souls who finds something "deep" in this very large pile of verbal manure then I think therapy would be money well spent 
 This first novel, sadly, reads like one.  The prose is so lacking in polish that I really thought I was reading the work of a high schooler.  As far as the story....predictable and rather hard to believe.  Please note: I love Italy and cycling, so I thought this would be right up my alley, but, among the many, many books written by Americans who try to capture the essential essence of Europe, this one fails to satisfy.  Just one man's opinion 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 This is overall an excellent cookbook.  It's simple, easy to follow, and has good recipes.  Not great but good.  That being said, this is NOT a book for the absolute beginner.  It assumes that you know a lot of basic terminology and technique, which is really stupid considering the title.    The book is marketed for people who don't know how to boil water, and yet on the very first page it tells you to fill a saucepan with cold water and immerse an egg.  A SAUCEPAN?  I don't know about you, but when I was a beginning cook, I called that particular item "a pot" -- the word saucepan is correct, but you'd need to be a culinary sort of person to know that a saucepan is not a pan at all, that is, not an object which is wide and round but only an inch deep.  A novice cook sees the word PAN and thinks of a skillet\spider\frying pan.  Most people do; it's an understandable error.    I gave my sister this book and asked her what she'd do when confronted with the instruction to fill a saucepan with cold water and immerse an egg.  She went into the cupboard, took out a 14" frying pan about half an inch deep, filled it with water, and stuck the egg in.  The egg was about three times as high as the sides of the pan.  My sister isn't stupid, she just doesn't know that a saucepan is actually a small pot.  Nobody who buys a book titled "How Long Do I Cook a Three-Minute Egg?" is going to know that!  After this, the book goes on with such instructions as, "dice the vegetables finely" ... um, dice?  What does dice mean?  Oh, it means to chop up?  How was I supposed to know that?  Into what shape do I chop?  How big should the shapes be?  How thin is finely?  The book says nothing, so if you're unfamiliar with a fine dice, you're screwed.  After that, here's the book telling us "allow to simmer for half an hour" without ever bothering to mention what simmer means.  Is it high heat?  Low?  The same heat I was cooking on before?  Does it mean there are bubbles in the liquid?  Again, no explanation whatsoever.  As I stated, this is a great book, but I cannot stress enough how it is NOT FOR BEGINNERS 
 Note to readers: Both of the reviews below were obviously planted by the publisher or some other party with an interest in selling this book. The content is identical and they were probably written by the same person (or computer). I'm an impartial reviewer. I'm familiar with Charlie Cutshaw's work and bought this book largely because his name was on the cover. None of his style is evident. He probably did nothing more than edit Val Shilin's punctuation and grammar. The writing style is identical to that found on Shilin's website -- slightly archaic, stilted, but grammatically-correct  English. Although Shilin is described as a "close associate" of Kalashnikov, I think his job title is more likely PR flack for Izhmash Arms. If you've seen Shilin on TV, you know he speaks English fluently, makes an excellent presentation, and tries hard to come off like a regular American kind of guy. The content of this book is pretty thin, with lots of unnecessary and redundant references to the brilliance of M. T. Kalashnikov. My softcover edition runs only 186 pages with large type and many photos. My interests run to the history, development, design, and nomenclature of Kalashnikov firearms that can be legally owned in the U.S. Much of this book is devoted to arms unavailable to civilians, e.g., submachineguns, general purpose machineguns, grenade launchers, and so forth. It's interesting, but not very useful. There is no "inside" information here besides what Izhmash wants you to believe about their firearms. If you are an AK owner interested in technical information or the history of your rifle, you can do much better than this book. 
 I would normally support my asian sistas but The Dim Sum of All Things was pretty hard to swallow. Yes, Mrs. Wong-Kelter has exceptional writing skills being a 4th grade Spelling Bee champ and all. But I did not like her main character, Lindsey, a narrowminded, judgmental, hypocritical, self-aborbed 20 something receptionist who spends much of her days obsessing over her so-called "Hoarders" (white boys with asian fetish) when she herself is a Hoarder of all things white including boys. She even has the audacity to be angry with Michael (her 1/4 chinese, white boy crush) for his "lack of cultural knowledge and self-admitted distance from his partial Asianness" (256) while poor little Lindsey finds it hard to escape her Asian identity and has spent her whole life trying not to fit the typical Asian stereotype.  If you want a coming of age chick lit, this is not it. Lindsey still has alot to of learning to do.  If you want a juicy romance. Forget it. Her relationship with Michael is slow to develop, then ends abruptly. We still don't know much about him.  The only plus is there's no doubt the author is funny and great with words but bottom line there was NO PLOT whatsoever 
 I can never forgive Mary Calhoun for her book _Audubon Cat_.  This book is a glorification of a cat while it hunts birds.  As a bird watcher I was highly offended, and as a father I found it very awkward trying to explain to my child what the owl was going to do to the cat it caught 
  McKenzie offers a fun and popularized account of the life of David.  However, the text he produces, far from being scholarly, often reads a bit like a tabloid account of King David.  Deconstructing the book of Samuel, a Herculean and important task, has been accomplished elsewhere by serious scholars who offer very deep reconstructions of this most fascinating and contradictory character.  Readers looking to explore the subject would do well to look for Professor B. Halpern's seminal work, "David's Secret Demons."  While not as breezy in style, the book goes far deeper in uncovering its subject and will offer the reader far more food for thought.  Therefore, if looking for an easy read, pick up McKenzie, but those with a serious interest in King David should put the time and effort into a more serious work.  Please, take a look at Halpern; you won't regret it.  
 Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See "The Sacketts', "Conagher", "The Shadow Riders", or "The Quick and the Dead". This is far less a believable Western. Few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern, not authentic. Sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie. Not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters I would want to see developed 
 Shallow characters, plot uninteresting, interactions not convincing at all. In my eyes, Kellerman's best trait has been always the depiction of the anti-urban American landscape and way of life. His detective plots (decent at most) were just the vehicle fot this depiction. But in this novel not even that subproduct is achieved. As some other reader pointed out, the novel is little more than a series of "drove there-wore this-ate that" sequences that leave us wanting. Stephen Cannel plus clothing descriptions 
 I felt for some of the families, and wanted to shake others, despite my sympathy for their plight and the author's seeming admiration for them. The real disappointment was the author's poor writing and lack of any thoughtful insights or understanding. Save your time and money. 
 I absolutely love Gaelic Storm and was really looking forward to this latest release.  However, when I played through this album not one song caught stuck in my memory.  Usually there is at least one tune that you find yourself humming but I can't recall a single tune from this collection.  I decided this might very well be the last CD I'll ever purchase.  I'm making the switch to an all electronic music collection and will be more selective before purchasing an entire album collection again.  For their next release I'll sample each song but if nothing catches my ear then I'll pass 
  should of written these years ago. They are wack, plain and simple. If it's on MTV or VH1, you know it's commercial. They can't rap, they are just another of the Down south's ABC rappers.  
 Black Stone Cherry's CD is the best album that I have ever bought! Every single song on the CD is awesome! I love it! I clicked on five stars but for some reason it is showing 2...THIS CD IS a 5 all the way!! 
 All things considered, this performance is far less impressive and interesting than Gould's. Counterpoint lacks, very quiet and smooth playing, no flagrant and uprising dynamics shifting. No take offs, no surprise. Ideal as muzak, in elevator or restaurant. 
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my fiancé. I looked all over for a money clip/wallet that had an actual clip - not just the magnetic clip. So needless to say I was thrilled when I found this one online. After my fiancé opened it up, he put his money in the clip. The clip is located in the middle of the wallet so you have to get creative and fold your money more than just in half. After using it for a few weeks, the pin in the clip fell out. He was able to fix it, but I would not be comfortable carrying money around in a faulty clip. 
 Sturdy enough for the price, but no power.  Replaced original battery with a new duracell.  Still fuctioned like the battery was drained.  Like I mentioned before, what do you expect for the price 
 I like Susana Palazuelos, I enjoyed her meal at Izote in Mexico City...and have used her recipes, but I have no idea what she was doing for this book.  In my opinion, this was done when her vision was still quite immature.  My main complaint about her recipes is that they are completely Creole Revisionist... in other words they are done from a very Spanish / Euro perspective... the Herb, Chile & Spice combinations have been extremely simplified & you really do not get to understand & appreciate the true genius of Mexican Cuisine.  Its like a Spaniard revised all the recipes.  Truly dissappointing.... it should be embarrassing to here that Rick Bayless's books are a bit closer than this one 
 If you're one of those people who paid money for the book or spent the few hours reading it when you could have been shampooing your hair or some other trivial task, then yes, be mad, feel cheated and confused.  However, if you're like me who came upon this book that someone threw away, you might not be so angry.   Flip forward to 1999, Rosemary wakes from a 27 year coma to find her son, Andy, is the most popular fellow in the world with the ability to bring together all people.  He has no religious agenda other than a "can't we all get along" umbrella that has  succeeded greatly on a worldwide scale.  When it's discovered that our Rosemary is the Mom of the most beloved person in the world, she gets thrown into the arena of celebrity too.    If you look at this book as a whole, it's not particularly good but if you can look at some of the premises, some are kind of interesting.  The ending which at first left me feeling cheated actually took on more meaning when I reread it.    If you come across this book and have nothing to do for about 2 hours, not a bad read...otherwise not really worth your while 
 I will usually read and accept anything, but this book is just so beyond fact for even realistic fiction.  I could have handled this book a lot better if there was no "Frankie".  The character Frankie is just too unbelievable.  I work with "talented and gifted" children that are Frankie's age (8 years old) and not one of them is even remotely this advvanced.  If Frankie was say, 12 or 13 I could accept her maturity, her dedication to her music and so forth, but this is not even believable to anyone who has a child or works with them.  It would be tolerable if Frankie was not the center of the book.  They spend more time about Frankie this and Frakie that, then on the main plot of the book.  This is the 3rd book that I have read or at least tried to read from Iris Johansen and it will be my last.  I just don't like the way she writes or her main characters.  Evertime I buy another one of her books I am always hoping that this will be the one that changes my mind.  Oh well, another book to donate 
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 Interested as I am in the subject matter, I was very disappointed in this book.  It would be better labeled "Meditations of Malinche," as the book is overly heavy in giving us the interior thoughts of this historical figure.  And these hemorrhage in rhetorical questions.  What I most missed was that the novel failed to make the larger than life characters and events of this period of Mexican history come alive in three, palpitating dimensions.  The language often turns lyrical, poetic, symbolical and/or abstract, removing me from the events narrated instead of immersing me in them 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 The description of this dvd led me to expect a movie like "Musa" or "Warriors of Heaven and Earth"--I'd have even been happy with a movie comparable to "Crouching Tiger"--this movie isn't up to the standards of any of these movies though.  More of a farce than anything close to an "adventure"-the scenery is wasted with a lame plot that drags on and makes the movie seem about twice as long as it really is.  Perhaps if my own expectations had been lower--I wouldn't be so harsh on this movie--but compared to "Musa" or "Warriors of Heaven and Earth"--it's defintely sub standard. Different strokes--as they say--perhaps you'll enjoy this movie--I didn't! 
 The Gotan Project were going to perform in Sydney, Australia in January. I had never heard of them, but loving tango music, I decided to buy this recording to test the music before booking for the live performance. And what did I hear? An unimaginative electronic rhythm beat, recorded too loud in comparison with the rest of the instruments, a colourless female singer, an outstanding bandeneon player (whom you could hardly hear over the electronic beat), works that have hardly any tunes - just a change in harmonies, with frequent overtones of other tango composers. Terrible! The only 'reasonable' piece was the last one by Piazzolla from the film 'Sur' - but the performance by the male singer on the 'Sur' CD puts this the dull female to shame. Needless to say, I did not book for the live performance, and gave the CD away to a person I do not particularly like 
 Somewhere, in a fake Latin American country, Irene and Francisco meet and fall in love in the midst of a military dictatorship.  They discover murderous plots surrounding numerous characters that at first seem inconsequential but become very important.  Unfortunately at times the plot is slow moving and uninteresting, but the overall take on the book is pretty good.  I wouldn't read another Allende book for pleasure though.  
 This is possibly the most miserable, gloomy film Timothy Dalton has ever made.  He plays the King of Piedmont, who develops an inexplicable passion for a rather tiresome French countess.  She, however, is devoted to her rather wet husband and wants nothing to do with the King, which shows from the beginning that she has deplorable taste.  However, her husband's family want her to give into the King because he is making everyone's lives a misery moping about, and when in the end she realises even her husband wants her to give in to him, she agrees to become the King's mistress.  She proceeds to revenge herself on her husband's family by having them banished to their family estate, but keeps her husband around to act as a lackey. Although the King is crazy about her, she still insists she doesn't love him, until in the end he loses his temper and gives her a black eye.  While I don't in the least blame him, I feeel it would have made a more interesting scene if he had walloped her on a different portion of her anatomy.  She persuades the King to get involved in a war with France, then gets ill with smallpox.  Even after he has risked his life nursing her through the disease, the ungrateful bitch still doesn't love him, what a cow.  Then she runs off with her wimpy husband, and the King is reduced to sniffing her underwear.  It all ends miserably for everyone, in the pouring rain (it never seems to stop raining in Piedmont).  I have no idea whether this preposterous film is based on true events, and if so how accurate it is, but the goings-on in Piedmont make the English monarchy look positively sane by comparison 
 Some passages in "Hollywood Babylon II" strongly echo "Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries," an obscure pulp paperback by John Austin, written in 1969-1970.      "The girl's head was frightfully battered but that was the least of it" ("Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries," Page 82, Black Dahlia case).      "The victim's head had been bashed almost beyond recognition-but that wasn't the worst of it." (Hollywood Babylon II, Page 127-130, Black Dahlia case). 
 I was very disappointed to see that the cards all say Season's Greetings or Happy Holidays.  On the box it says Christmas Cards so why dont they say Merry Chistmas?  I think it is shameful.  We have take  Christmas out of the season and it is misleading it say Christmas Cards on the box and there is nothing about Christmas inside.  i would not buy these for  anyone else 
 Sorry, but this is both an unimportant work, and pornographic (when every chapter revolves around one sex scene, I think it is safe to accuse a book of being pornographic).  Understandably, it has been written that this book was intended to be exploitative, and di Prima wrote it because she needed money.  Great.  I hold nothing against writers doing what they need to do to make a living.  If I recall correctly, Stephen King got his start writing articles for Playboy.  With all that said, however, I think it is also important not to hold a book to unrealistic expectations, simply because of the author.  Porn, porn, porn.  Let's see: chapter 1, sex with Ivan.  Chapter 2, recollection of the first time she had sex with Ivan.  Chapter 3, sex with Robin (a man in love with Ivan).  Chapter 4, Sex with Tomi (a female friend).  Chapter 5, Tomi has sex with Tomi's brother.  Chapter 6, Sex with 4 other women.  Chapter 7, sex with Tomi's father Serge.  Chapter 8, sex with young Jack and some guy with big ears while runaway girl watches.  And so it goes, through all the chapters.  So, if you're looking for a "spank" book, then check it out.  If you're looking for a book about the beats from a woman's perspective (as it is boldly proclaimed on the front cover), look somewhere else. 
 I wouldn't recommend this product to a person with long hair like myself. After using this so called "Instant detangler" my hair was more tangled then ever. In my opinion any cheap hair conditioner from a drug store will do a better job 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 For the last 2 years I have listened to about 1 audio book per week and this takes first place as the worst of the lot. The exercises in this audio book are trivial and insulting. Save your money 
 pretending that 3-6 never happened (don't we all wish that!) this flea bag starts with ms.curtis hiding out as the head mistress of a private school(with a false name what kind of back ground check did they use on her) and still living in fear of her brother michael. well as you can guess he's back and still a little pissed off that she became a star and he has had to do all these bad sequels.    nothing new here and nothing worth seeing (but at least we do get to see jamie and her late mother janet (playing her "pyscho" role once again) act together for what would be the last time).  just a waste of time but i hope it helped put ms. curtis's daughter in collage, as that is the only reason i can think of that would get her back into this mess 
 I used to be a big proponent of Netgear.  Not anymore. First off, after reading the package on the VPN box, I believed the software client was included, but no.  Once I figured that out, I bought the software, which costs more than the router.  After a week of hacking, I finally got the software to work, on one out of 4 machines.  One machine hard re-boots if you try any kind of network activity once the VPN is connected.  I've disabled everything I can think of, it just won't work.  It won't work with Vista either, no word from Netgear on a date.  All other VPN software has to be un-installed, so forget using one machine to connect to a Netgear, Watchguard, Cisco, etc. vpn.  Very frustrating software

 Once again the publishers with the So Called "greatest selling cd in the history of Kids cds" has done it again.

 I was more or less forced to buy this product because I had very precise size requirements and this product fitted them.  I was very disappointed by the quality of the product for the cost.  It comes in about 19 different pieces, all of which are a hollow plastic polymer.  It is fairly lightweight, which could be good or bad depending on what you plan to do with it.  At the $200+ price, you'd think they would include a shelf, but they only give you a stencil to make it yourself out of 'shelving material'.  My biggest complaint was that I was missing four of the pieces and had other extra pieces when I received it.  I got bounced back and forth between Amazon and Suncast's customer service before I got the right people at Suncast to send me replacement parts (which took over a week to arrive).  On top of that, they didn't even send me the right replacement parts!  After another phone call and explanation, more parts were sent.  If I keep the extras I have, and make a couple more calls, I may have enought for a second shed.  Ugh.  Directions are ok, but they'll make you scratch your head as you look through all the similiar looking parts. Especially when they don't send you the right pieces 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 Ok i really only liked her singe Unbelivable, My Baby, Thank You, and Instigator was OK. The truth is her voice is pretty bad its a lot like Britney's. Sorry but Kaci can't sin 
 Cruver opens his book from an ethical high horse, but his own actions make me wonder who he is to accuse others of greed. He has shown he can take the low road himself, by:  -- scheming to continue getting paychecks even though he was no longer earning them; -- taking advantage of delays in shutting down the program to provide employees with free computer; -- attempting to take out of the company the program he and his team developed; -- spending his job-hunting time burning "free" CDs of downloaded music. (By the way, Brian, if you are listening in, I read a library copy of your book, so you have a reader for which you have received no incremental royalty.)  The unfortunate thing is that, to many of us, there is nothing wrong with taking advantage of an out-of-control benefits programs and downloading CDs instead of buying them. The differences are subtle, perhaps. But you should not steal from your employer, even if your employer has been underhanded. Under oath, before Congress, most Enron executives took the Fifth, implying that that they had done wrong and knew it. It seems to me that Cruver has done wrong and may not know it, which is even more tragic.  Ethics? I think Cruver has a lot to learn. Greed? He knows a bit about that, as a victim and as a perpetrator. 
 I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this book. This is one I won't pass on to or recommend to anyone. The messy dialogue itself is a reason to skip this one 
 Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C, the battery discharges quickly and won't take a full charge.  I've removed the driver, with no change.  The next step was to do a hard reset of the Tungsten C and I'm hoping it will take charge.  I'm taking this keyboard back for a full refund 
 A good book, but not the best 
 We're fans of the GeoTrax series, expecially the GeoMotion pieces.  However, the Roundhouse was designed very poorly, if at all.  There are several design flawas which cause major frustration to the kids, I'll just explain the 2 main ones: 1) The roundhouse has 3 tracks leading up to it; two for it to pass straight through and one road which is perpendicular.  If the train exits through the perpendicular road, since the roundhouse track is facing that direction, it cannot came back around and enter through the straight road; the same is true if it exits via the straight side.  Furthering this problem is there is no manual crank to rotate the roundhouse track to the correct port, so even if you wanted to manually turn the track to accept the train, you can't.  The train gets jammed up and the kids get frustrated. 2) Many of the kits, including the main set include additional cars aside from the lead engine.  They are to be attached behind the lead.  You cannot use a train with any length if you want it to fit in the roundhouse - all cars must be removed otherwise the track gets jammed up when the roundhouse tries to rotate and the other cars are attached from behind on non-rotating track.   The conecpt may have been good, but the implementation was horrible and makes this the worst toy my kids got last year.  Furthering the problem, is that I can't take it back since it doesn't dissasemble 
 If you are a really hard-core NC&BS' fan (as I was until recently) you already have all those songs spread over tens of compilations and singles. If you don't have them, you never were a NC&BS fan. That is the fact. My opinion about this record is, that is released just for milking of some newborn fans. A shame on you, Mr. Cave 
 I ordered this book but didn't notice that it was an E-Book. How can they charge the same price for an E-Book? Personally, I think the Acrobat Reader sucks when compared to a real paperback or regular old HTML. Anyway, I figured I'd try to download it since I'd placed the order. WOW, there is Adobe DRM and MS Passport to deal with. Way too much trouble, I just called Amazon and cancelled the order. Maybe the content of the book is OK, I don't know. If I were an author I don't think I'd let them offer my books in PDF form just yet 
 Ordered this because it was suggested by Amazon as a book that might be of interest. This because I am so very fond of David Petersen's writing. Kerasote can't hold a candle to Petersen! He does not enlarge his subject to include any of the larger insights or issues, of which there are many imbedded in the subject of man and nature. From Melville to Petersen, we have struggled to describe and comprehend our relationship to society and nature. Kerasote adds little to the discussion 
 Cool Rules has to be in the "Top Ten Worst Books Published In 2000" list.  Whatever made the authors think they could write about this subject?!?  This book is definitely un-cool 
 I bought this a while back and began finding problems with it right away.  1) The trimmer cannot operate on A/C power alone.  This means you can't plug it into the wall and use it.  Instead, you have to charge the battery, then unplug it to use it.  2) About 2 weeks after I bought it, the beard trimmer attachment broke.  The little tabs that hold it at different lengths snapped off so you can only use it on the shortest setting, and you have to hold the attachment on with your hand so it won't slide off.  Clearly, I'm not the only one who this has happened to.  3) The nose trimmer has very dull blades. I don't normally use a nose trimmer nor do I really need one, but I have a cheap one that I got in my Christmas stocking that I've used a few times.  Out of curiosity, I tried the attachment that came with this trimmer and was introduced to a new kind of pain.  It was pulling at the hairs but not cutting them.  I contacted the a representative at Norelco to see if I they would send me a replacement beard attachment or if I could purchase just that attachment.  They directed me to their service centers who wanted $10 for just that attachment.  Including shipping, it would have cost me almost what I payed for the whole set.  My advice:  pay a little more for something sturdier.  That's what I plan on doing 
 I suppose it's alright if you like overlong musicals focusing on maniacal, manipulative mothers 
 This book should have been a hard back and it isn't! I will be returning it as the order was incorrect 
 This book is little more than a meandering list of obtuse, random literary references on the word "Manliness". I must admit that after the first couple of chapters I could not force myself to press on and read the whole thing. It is as boring as reading a train schedule.  I did skim the book to see if the rest of it follows the same pattern of random references with no interpretation. It does.  I did read the final chapter to see if the book comes to any conclusions. It does not.  The idea for the book is interesting, but the book itself is full of padding and fill 
 Disappointing self-help/literary guidebook that came utterly lavished with positive reviews; The New Yorker said of the book "Curious, humorous, didactic and dazzling...It contains more human interest and play of fancy than most fiction." Maybe I'm missing something or was just looking for something else, but it seems to me that Alain de Botton's book is nothing more than a banal self-help book that is more eloquently written than the other works in this dubious genre. Botton doesn't offer the reader much in the way of literary analysis or explication, rather, he merely uses the life (and scatterings of the work) of Marcel Proust to launch into his mediocre prescriptions for living. Surprisingly, little is actually said about In Search of Lost Time, the author prefers to inundate the reader with scatterings of anecdotes about Proust's health problems and social life. There are a few sections which are worthwhile, such as the great "what if it could have been another way?" conversation between Proust and James Joyce that reads like,   "PROUST [while taking furtive stabs at an homard a l'americaine, huddled in his fur coat]: Monsieur Joyce, do you know the Duc de Clermont-Tonnerre? JOYCE: Please, appelez-moi James. Le Duc! What a close and excellent friend, the kindest man I have met from here to Limerick. PROUST: Really? I am so glad we agree [beaming at the discovery of his common acquaintance], though I have not yet been to Limerick.  VIOLET SCHIFF [leaning across, with a hostess's delicacy, to Proust]: Marcel, do you know Jame's big book?  PROUST: Ulysses? Naturellement. Who had not read the masterpiece of our new century? [Joyce blushes modestly, but nothing can disguise his delight].  VIOLET SCHIFF: Do you remember any passages in it?  PROUST: Madame, I remember the entire book. For instance, when the hero goes to the library, excuse my anglais, but I cannot resist [starting to quote]: "Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred..." (pg. 112).   There is also some interesting discouragement from Virginia Woolf upon reading Proust's great masterpiece,   	"I detest my own vocabulary. Why be always spouting words? [...] Take up Proust after dinner and put him down. This is the worst time of all. It makes me suicidal. Nothing seems left to do. All seems insipid and worthless." (pg. 187).   Unfortunately however, How Proust can Change Your Life is ultimately an overstated, dressed up self-help book with many useless suggestions about how you should live. It is not substantive literary criticism. For the latter, I suggest you seek out the work of Edmund Wilson.     
 This is yet another cookie cutter writing book. Very little in this volume was new to me and the author's attitude toward certain types of writing, such as contemporary literary fiction, was more than a little insulting. Perhaps he can include a chapter called "Don't Insult Your Readers" in the next edition.  If you've never read a writing book before, this one has some practical advice in it, but you can get this type of information elsewhere 
 These authors were brave trying to write a lasting hardcover on technology that dates faster than sliced bread. Sure, the information is comprehensive and tries to cover all technologies, but in such a general way that those of us with more than a skerick of knowledge will get bored quickly 
 This movie is NOT for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird.  Sure, there are plenty of plot holes, Reeves is in it so don't expect an academy award.....however the plot is very interesting (again filled with tons of holes) but I watch a movie to be entertained, not to be a film critic or to analyze everything.  Overall, if you like weird movies like "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" this movie is for you, if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how "true to life" it may or may not be.....well just skip this one 
 I wish that everyone can get the informations he need easly especialy that improve the humanity.I'm veterinary medicine doctor work in poultry ,broilers,layers and parentstock.Always searching for the update informations.I found Amazon a good source of information for books.I love reading books, I used to bay and read at least 2 to 3 books in a month. When I'm searching in your sites sometimes I found myself puzzled which book to read or to get .I have my own library that provid me with many basic sciences and diferent subjects,dictionaries.I believe that the man must keep on reading and reading to the last day in his life.I do believe that the man is what the books he read and still reading.The books man raed is the masterkey in his life ,it will open new windows in his life.Man put part of him in each book he print 
    I have read this book several times. Each time, I grew more and more puzzled. I thought...I thought this was supposed to be about writing!  It isn't. If you're looking for Brenda's personal philosophy, this is The Book. If you want advice on how to write, this is a terrible book. The only good side could be that she encourages writers who don't see themselves as good writers, or writers at all.   Other than that, the book is so many murdered trees. Brenda spouts the whole garbage about truth being truth if you think it is true. Her school is the type that shrinks from approaching the technical aspects of writing. Or telling some people that their piece of writing is junk.    Basically, she tells you what you want to hear. All is good and nice, a few mildly interesting stories, and no relevant advice on writing. I kept getting this nauseated feeling while reading it.   Snore.. 
 Was rather of a long story and sometimes hard to read as it doesn't get to the point quick. But I did get one good idea from it so there was some value in it for me 
 While this book may be interesting to the history buff I caution all seriously wanting to learn the history of WWII and the campaign in Italy: BEWARE!!! It isn't as though author Botjer does not have good style. On the contrary. However, there are minor inacuracies in basic historical facts, the research that was done is sub-par, and it is quite out of date. There are more recent compilations on the Italian Campaign that are more thorough than this. As an academic work it is unnotable. This was written as a high school report, there was nothing new. Also, the research of primary sources was severely lacking, and the secondary sources were not much better. Overall, as a historian Botjet should have utilized more resources and done a better job writing a history on these campaigns 
 I have to say I agree with some of the other reviews here, that this collection of poetry by "Rumi" is in reality modern American poetry by someone drawing only very loosely on Rumi's work. It is rather a stretch to call it a translation! If one were cynical, one might think the large number of books from this "translator" indicates merely a money-making exercise.  Much better collections/translations can be found, like Maryam Mafi's and Azima Melita Kolin's, but I would personally recommend Juliet Mabey's Rumi: A Spiritual Treasury. This is not only a gorgeous book to look at, but more importantly, both its selection and English rendition demonstrate a deftness of touch that make you think you are reading something very close to the original sentiment. A rare achievement 
 In the immortal words of Gene Autry: How can anyone be right, when everybody's wrong?  Mr. Garea's (Amazon's Spotlight review) thoughtful, well written critique on the Heisenberg portrayed in Mr. Rose's book is "compleat" (yuck yuck), and there is nothing I need to add.  Mr. Rose's slashing attack on Mr. Heisenberg is too simplistic, fails to take into account the impact of the political, economic and moral collapse of Weimar Germany on the German people, and plays too heavily on what Mr. Rose sees as 400 unchanging years of Germanic totalitatian culture.  Heisenberg's harshest critics, the Nobel Laureates Lenard and Stark with their Newtonian cause & effect "German Physics" (as opposed to "Jewish Physics" ie relativity & disputes about quantum mechanics a la Einstein and Niels Bohr), they were the ones falsely tied to a vision of Germanic Culture.  Not Heisenberg.  Where I part ways with Mr. Garea is in Mr. Garea's tounge in cheek portrayal of a Werner Heisenberg qua James Bond (maybe not Sean Connery or Roger Moore--more like a Timothy Dalton or George Lazenby) from Thomas Powers "Heisenberg's War: the Secret History of the German Bomb."  Whatever else he was, Mr. Heisenberg was no smoothie--a common denominator for Bondness.  However, I am convinced by Mr. Powers's thesis that Mr. Heisenberg did retard Germany's development of the atomic bomb.  No, Heisenberg did not "fake" math calculations or create false evidence, but as Mr. Powers carefully documents, Heisenberg did work hard to create a false impression of the feasibility of creating an atom bomb.  Of the different opportunities that Heisenberg had for pushing development of a German A-bomb, none could have been as fortuitous as the June 1942 meeting with Albert Speer.  Speer had just been appointed Hitler's honcho to get the economy on a war footing, and develop some answer to the allies increasingly relentless and unanswerable bombing missions.  Additionally, the Nazi regime needed to do something about the military reverses at Moscow.  If Heisenberg wanted to build an atom bomb, Speer was ready to fund one.  Instead, Heisenberg gave a deliberately obtuse presentation about the atom bomb.  Heisenberg was well aware that a reactor would create the fissonable element 94 (plutonium), but instead spoke generally of "transuranics."  This conscious fogging of the science intentionally left a false impression on Speer's science advisor, a physical chemist named Lieb.  After the meeting, Lieb (incorrectly) believed that only U-235 could be used for a bomb, and that there was no viable way to separate U-235 from U-238.  Heisenberg knew better--plutonium could replace U-235--and how much fissonable material was needed for a critical mass: about the size of a pineapple.  Finally, Heisenberg told Speer that perhaps a working reactor could be built in 1942, but a bomb could not be built before 1945.  These dates are key for two reasons.  First, the dates are outside the parameters that Speer needed, and second: they were also damn good guesses.  Mr. Fermi created the world's first sustained chain reactor in Chicago in December, 1942 and the US blew up the first bomb in July 1945.  Finally, if Heisenberg really wanted to go all out on a German bomb, there was Speer ready to write the big checks.  Instead, Heisenberg & his people asked for piddling amounts of funding to continue basic research--so small that Speer promptly lost interest in atom bombs.  The importance of this June 1942 Meeting, and the difference between what Heisenberg knew and what he told Speer is lost on Mr. Rose.  Heisenberg did consciously retard German developments of an A-bomb, if only by deliberately creating several key false impressions--not exactly the stuff that wins hearts of Ursula Andress, Jill St. John or even Sophie Marceau, but it still counts.    Nevertheless, how should we account for Heisenberg's inconsistent actions both during and especially after the war?  Mr. Powers suggests several reasons, but I do not believe he gives enough creedence to Heisenberg's (and most Germans) fear & distrust of Soviet Russia.  Many individuals in the West initially excused Nazi excesses in the name of restoration of the economy (if only taming rampent inflation), and creating a bulwark against Stalinism.  One of Heisenberg's key co-workers was a (now former) communist sympathizer who returned to Nazi Germany after two & a half years in a Soviet prison, with a forced bogus confession of being a Gestapo-Trotsky-Bukharin spy.  Something needed to be done about Stalin.  Moreover, post WWI Germany featured seemingly endless rises and collapses of Governments.  At the time, it was not unreasonable to believe that Hitler's thousand year reich would be replaced in next year's coup by the Christian Democrats, or the Weirmarcht would throw out the Nazis, and continue a secular (as opposed to Nazi racist paganism) military dictatorship.  The post WWII alibi of the "good germans" was not only that they "didn't know," but that "someone" needed to stop Stalin (not to mention the crap about building the autobahn, but we digress).  Finally, Heisenberg's seemingly inconsistent statements after the war are probably a combination of his foolish pride (OF COURSE he could have built a bomb--if he REALLY wanted to), and his awkward speaking style.  This last point is more of an impression--but Heisenberg was a physicist, not a politician or a public speaker.  He could talk about science with exactness--but outside of that realm, he left much to be desired.  In short, I am convinced by Mr. Powers's arguments and the breath of his documentation.  Mr. Rose needed to pay closer attention to Powers's book, and the documentation used by Powers.  As a final note on both this book and Mr. Powers's book--indeed, since Heisenberg's death in 1976, any book about Heisenberg--an important source as to Heisenberg's postwar views is the 1967 book "The German Atomic Bomb," and a battery of extensive personal interviews, all by David Irving.  Mr. Powers merely cites this source--an undisputedly important source--without comment.  Still, as a historian, there is no question that Mr. Irving's reputation has taken a beating.  See, for example, "Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial" by Richard J. Evans.  Mr. Irving has recently been sentenced to three years imprisonment in Austria as a "holocaust denier."  What all Mr. Irving's personal beliefs, credentials, and current legal woes add to the discussion of Heisenberg's activities from 1939 to 1945, I do not know.  I have no idea what Mr. Irving's views were in 1965-1967, when Mr. Irving extensively interviewed Heisenberg and wrote his book--and if Heisenberg was aware of those views in giving such time and access to Mr. Irving.  I only mention this as an additional piece of the Heisenberg puzzle that may (or may not) mean anything.  Be that as it may, the bottom line is: Read Powers's book, and not this one.  And Amazon is damn lucky to have thorough reviewers like Mr. Garea 
 This novel was intriguing and fast. The plotline was engrossing, and the insiders view into a law firm illuminating. It was a book which IO felt unable to put down. The aspect which I dislike, however, is the unrealistic characterization.  Yes, I understand that corruption often reigns in our modern world. But surely the author could have used some remotely scrupulous characters. Few of the main characters have a semblance of fidelity (Carolyn, in particular, appears to have slept with the entire law firm), and none are properly content. Most men are divorced (in Rusty's case, marital relations are so weak that he can hardly be considered an exception), and all seem to have a penchant for activities considered by most to be morally illicit. Barbara was actually my strongest hope for sanity, but the ending deprived me even of that (I won't disclose the details). If this is a realistic portrayal of our modern world, then there is no hope for humanity. This major flaw, in my mind, was not sufficient to nullify the novel's advantages, but severly detracted from my rating. 
 "Sudden Death" is the second Andy Carpenter book that I've read(I was introduced to the series last year when I read 'Bury the Lead'). As with the previou book, the charaters are inteesting, well-developed and quirky without being too annoying.  The plot is the biggest problem with 'Sudden Death'. There's a lot of build-up, but very little payoff. This won't stop me from reading other entries in this series, but Rosenfelt needs to tweak things a bit. Some of the similarities to Robert B. Parker and the 'Spenser' cast are rather obvious here. Maybe Rosenfelt needs to work on finding his own 'voice' and motivation for these characters, rather than simply emulating what others have done before 
 Sounds exciting, but actually, well, boring, mostly because the author  fails to distinguish between two very different claims:  first, that  boredom, the state of mind, didn't exist until recently, and second, that  it wasn't talked about much until recently.  The first claim would be  exciting and bizarre, but the argument at most supports the second 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 I am an avid reader and could not make it through this book. His other books were so good. I could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be. In applying some of the recommended techniques, my 11 year old daughter, Emily, thought I lost my mind. Thank goodness things are back to normal. We are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice 
 This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money 
 If your body has no problems with insulin insenstitivity and you have terrific will power, then maybe this plan is right for you. but i whole heartedly disagree with his claims that certain foods with high fat content are unhealthy. ie nuts, avocados, fish oil, even butter (gasp!) he also says that eating meat in excess will cause it to rot in your intestines causing your skin and breath to smell! I've never heard of this phenomenon, I refuse to believe it, and physiologically it doesn't make sense. the only reason I gave this book one star is because of his advocation to "whole foods" which are unprocessed. contrary to what one "anti ornish" reviewer said, it's in my opinion that a huge part of the obviously unhealthy average american diet lies in the fact that heavily processed foods are bombarded with partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives. Many people in Europe eat daily by riding their bike to a local market, and preparing food that would otherwise spoil in a day or two. AND THAT IS A GOOD THING! the less a food is injected with man made hormones and chemical preservatives, the better off you are eating it. Long story short, if your protein needs aren't large and you don't have an insulin sensitivity problem, then you may lose fat  and become a bit healthier on this diet. otherwise, just make an effort to eat foods in moderation. it's as simple as that! cut out as much sugar and trans fats as possible. (no one ever needs those and in my opinion they aren't hard to live without.)and don't eat any more than you need to, to reach satiety 
 Unless you're extremely fluent in advanced mathematics, calculus, etc., this book is not for the faint of heart.  For those of us who never got past shop math - forget it.  The formulas and calculations are enough to knock you out or at least put you to sleep. I'll give it a re-read again, but first drive through, just blew me away - sorry, math was never my strong point! Overall - 2's the best this rates for non-mathemeticians 
 Any sound psychologist would want to "shape" the lives of girls as well as boys,to shape them into adults,but this writer wants us to see girls and women as eternal children,who need over  protection,never need to face real challenges,or real life. He doesn't seem to realize many girls need coraling in not only  boys.Instead he sets up a system where expectations are low for  girls,so parents might put less effort into a girl's education, aspirations and talents.Speaking of talents,he believes females and males have very distinct differences in the talent pool. Males analyical,females emotional intellence and verbal. How can a parent help their girl along if they believe she doesn't or shouldn't excell in hard science and maths. His obvious mysogamy is only too noticable,he doesn't want girls to excell or even try their hand in areas he feels are more  easily understood by boys. I have never read such a harmful book in my life.This psychobable will only prove how he is determined to work against females and trap them in small areas of achievement. Poor book,poorly written,works off of spotty brain research and sterotypes 
 This book is a classic example of why PBS should have its taxpayer life support plug pulled when they employ a leftist to give us his "unbiased" view of the world on "News Hour."  His fellow leftist and plagiarist, Goodwin, I guess is the "balance" for his views.  This book is so much nonsense that I don't know where to start in pointing out its complete abandonment from any semblance of journalistic honesty.  But if you are a Kool-Aid leftist, you will love this book. If you have more than a fifth-grade education, you will wonder why you wasted your two dollars to buy it. 
 This pair clearly knows what they are doing, but who in their right mind would spend millions to live in a bad derivative of Dorothy Draper and Sister Parrish? Their use of clashing patterns and brilliant color is one step away from a nervous breakdown. In a vigilent attempt to get press (and boy have they), they have masterminded an attention getting style that has kept them on the forefront of shelter magazines for two decades, yet they are clearly the laughing stock of thier peers. Pity they could not do something original AND liveable. Now that would have been brilliant 
 There are highlights here besides the well-received Yo That's A Lot Of Body with solid (though not amazing) New Jack Swing tracks such as Straight Down To Business, Cat-Thang, and World Party. Unfortunately, most of the other material is pretty cliche and boring. It's a worthy enough purchase suited for low prices 
 Caution, Spoilers Ahead  This is a really awful book--one of the few truly laughable works of recent so-called "hard"science fiction.  While there are a lot of unrelated sub plots (with some admittedly interesting scientific "what if's,") the real plot line is simplistic, preposterous, muddle-headed and just downright offensive.  In Baxter's hypothetical near future, people of the future somehow reach back in time to create a bunch of super intelligent children whose mission (we find in the end, after countless red herrings) is...wait for it...to destroy the universe!  But, these kids are not the bad guys, because (in Baxter's view) the "heat death" of the universe is somehow intolerable to the human spirit.  Thus, by destroying the universe ("It's the wrong universe!" exclaims one of the children) a new one with different physical laws will be created in its place; and even though everybody in the old universe dies a terrible death, it's ok because the new universe will somehow recreate the human mind and we will all live happily ever after in a universe that is eternal, set free of the horrible laws of thermodynamics.  This is about the loopiest idea for a science fiction story I've ever heard.  It also puts Baxter squarely in the camp of the "we-are-the-only-intelligent-life-in-the-universe" crowd.  As you may know, there are two lines of thought on extraterrestrial intelligence:  "we are alone" is one; and "we are not alone" is the other.  The math and statistics of each is camp points, not to a right or wrong analysis of the data, but rather insufficient data.  It's an argument tantamount to the existence of God, with both sides stridently arguing their obvious correctness.    In any case, this novel is pure drivel, with an idiotic premise, and an idiotic conclusion. 
 I found this book to very misleading compared to the back cover notes and the reviews on Amazon.  The book deals very LITTLE with deep sea creatures and is mostly obsessed with man's journey to the deep sea (i.e. subs, the Navy, boring self-obsessed scientists, rovers etc.)  I found it very boring 
 My driveway patrol worked okay for a few days then stopped sensing cars as they drove past. Does anyone know what I can do to get it working again 
 I paid 300+ dollars for a NEW Magellan GPS less than a yearand a half ago from boat Us and they have already declared it obsolete. If you expect any support DO NOT BUY Magellan. 
 My husband and I did not bother finishing this book. We skipped around to different chapters, as the editors suggest, in hopes of finding something erotic. The editors clearly had lofty aspirations for this book, but their  intentions fell short of what they managed to achieve. Unfortunately, most  of the stories were poorly written and laughably ridiculous; a bad  combination. You can get mediocre erotica on the 'net for free. Don't waste  your money 
 i don't know why but it is an ugly dress. it doesn't look like the pic. maybe it's my shape (i have wide angular, shoulders) but it is very high on the chest which made me look a little granny-like 
 OK, 72 pages of cliff notes for a 144 page book?  That is absurd!  Night is a classic work, filled with vivid metaphor and intensely emotional characters.  You could get a third of the way through it in the time it would take to BUY the cliff notes 
 The CD is great!!! The legendary Johnny Cash comes thru loud and clear on this CD. However, it took Amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails to them. Their attitude of "just wait a few more days and email us again" was both insulting and annoying. Thank goodness this wasn't a Christmas gift for someone. 
 With all respect to Mr. Hawking - this book should never been published. I'm not blaming him, but all others who are responsible it went to market.  Let me explain a little bit  Most of buyers of this book, are buying based on Hawking reputation from "Brief history of time" (which is excellent book). What we have here - pictures which doesn't have any relation with text (at least not valuable and are far to big - taking space in other words, you'll not buy book of 60 pages for 35 USD), changing from one subject to another, explaining the basic things somebody who is reading such a book should already know (spin - 2 pages) and then jumping to complicated things (M-theory - mentioned in 1 row) without explanation. Some jokes and comments I don't understand.  I bought this book 6 months age and came to approx 1/3 of book (poker between Hawking, Newton and I think Einstein). I didn't have nerves to read more ... this is first book in my life I didn't finish.  I never thought I'll write review, especially not like this and especially not for book of Mr. Hawking, but I felt cheated. There are so many other excellent books on same thematic, try them, forget this one.  But anyway, my 3 year old son was extremely happy by disintegrating this book to more then 1000 small pages ... lucky him.   
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 Despite buying four copies of 'Call to Action' for my development team, reading it through twice and making copious notes - I can't recommend that you read it.  It's not that it's bad - it's just not that good and I have to believe there are better books out there.  'Call to Action' describes itself as 'both a step-by-step, how-to manual and a treatise on the true nature of conversion'.  In my opinion, it fails to deliver on either count.  There's no doubt the authors know what they're talking about but, ironically, in a book dedicated to the process of communication, they fail to communicate either a cohesive overview or a detailed 'how-to' of the subject.  There's a facade of structure and some whizzy acronyms like 'AIDAS' and 'MAP' but very little flesh is laid on those sketchy bones.  The introduction identifies the main cause of the problem - the book started life as a collection of disparate web articles interspersed by 'top-tips' from marketers 'in the trenches'.  The articles themselves give the sense of having been shoe-horned into a structure simply for the sake of it.  The 'top-tips', more often than not, are completely irrelevant to the theme of the article they're paired with.  As a reader looking for greater understanding of the subject and some concrete next-steps, this discordant content yields as much confusion as clarity.  On top of this, the numerous typos, misquotes, repeated quotes and printing errors confirm that insufficient care has been taken in the preparation of this book.  It hasn't even been professionally proof-read, let alone purposefully written.  So how come I purchased four copies?  The first half of the book does contain some exciting ideas such as developing content based on the persona of the visitor and planning precise conversion scenarios from the home page to the conversion point for each type of visitor.  The second half of the book is mostly padding and pointless repetition of the ideas in the first half.  I purchased the other copies of the book after reading the first half and expecting the second half to follow in a similar vein.  All things taken into consideration, the book reads like a series of adverts for the authors' consulting services rather than as a 'how-to' or a treatise on the subject.  Other authors quoted in this book are:  Roy H. Williams, Jared Spool, Tamara Adlin and Jim Sterne, and I'll be checking out their writings in my continued search for genuine 'how-to' content.  The Eisenbergs could have made this book more effective and much simpler.  They chose not to write for their audience and, to my mind, that makes them guilty of the same sin they condemn online marketers of - focusing on themselves instead of on their customers.  The Eisenbergs make the point that content created for offline advertising rarely translates directly to the web.  This book is proof that the reverse is also true 
 I wouldn't buy this unless it's an emergency, because it's one of those chargers that reports errors, and makes your phone start beeping non-stop when it's done charging.  I don't want this because I like charging at night, the other chargers don't do this (I guess what it does is it starts fluctuating power from the wall, like switching off, when the battery is fully charged..so it beeps as if it's being plugged in over and over).  When I first got it, I was trying to carefully plug it into my phone--and I didn't want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger.  It wasn't going in smoothly and it didn't match up or seem to fit inside at ALL.  So I went a day without a phone and I did more research to see why the heck they'd lie that it fit my phone.  Finally I got fed up because I couldn't find another charger ANYWHERE where I live and I tried forcing it.  FINALLY it fit!  But I had to shove it in.. who knows if it was damaging my phone.  But it was charging so I was happy (my cell is my only phone.. so I was cut off from the world).  Then I tried getting it out and couldn't figure it out!  I had to jimmy it off, and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secure itself.  I was able to put it back on, and finally learned a routine so to speak, for taking it off, but it's cheap.  It's very cheap.  So, the charger works, but it's very hard to use and it isn't convenient at all.  I don't recommend it unless it's an emergency.  For me, it was 
 Mr. Newell uses an entertaining style to make his points, and the overriding philosophy he espouses hasn't changed, but strategies and tactics have!  He doesn't seem to have recent real-life experience with  data analysis or online efforts. The biggest successes are derived from a  combination of academics and street-wise, hands-on tactics 
 It takes better than two hours to find out if the faux legendary pianist 1900 will go down with the Virginian when it is blown up at sea after being taken out of service.  And it is two completely wasted hours.  Hard to say what is most annoying -- the omnipresent voiceover, the philosophical twaddle that rationalizes why he never leaves the ship, the philosophical twaddle when he almost leaves the ship, the bad acting, the farcical piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton, the fleeting love story with a young passenger who looks like Amelia Earhart confused about why she's on a ship instead of her plane. The movie is splendidly photographed -- give it that much.  I watched it because of the director's earlier Cinema Paradiso.  He is a far better cinematic teller of memoirs than of fables.  
 I went into this movie not expecting anything special. I had read the reviews and got a mixed feeling. I decided to go for it... I wish I hadn't. I couldn't even finish watching the movie it was so bad. Characters popping out of nowhere and having no purpose. Almost each and every scene could be given an award as worst scene in any movie if that award was given. I had read that some of the scenes were beautiful. All right, I suppose, the scenery perhaps... but the acting was awful. Even if I like an actor I try not to be bias and Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek are not bad actors, if I remember correctly. This was laughable. Sutherland's role had no purpose. It was well acted, but it meant nothing.  The story didn't work; it just didn't flow well. I felt almost... tipped while watching it because everything was off. No one is seriously offended and then swoons over the one who did the offending; not in a matter of a few seconds anyway. The story moved so fast and was so crooked that I called it quits before I squirmed through anymore of the Razzie worthy scenes 
 Even as dedicated of a Radiohead fan as I am, I really don't care much for this album. I say thank goodness for "Creep" because we may have never heard from them again (or at least not in the same way) if that song had not become as popular as it did 
 Galactic decided to go with a big-name producer named Dan the Automator.  Dan the Automator took an amazing, explosive, quirky funk sound and gutted it of any soul it had.  I'm sure these songs sound good live, that is without Dan the Automator's overproduction and mixing (Drum machines over Stanton Moore?  For shame!  The horror!).  The album itself is flat except for a few high points - "Paint" is good, "The Beast" is funky enough, "Never Called You Crazy" is good, and "All Behind You Now" is a great song, or would be live.  That's about it.  The rest of the album varies from so-so to outright boring, and considering the amazing amount of talent Dan the Automator had to work with in Galactic that's a crime.    Crazyhorse Mongoose and Late for the Future are both far superior records 
 I bought this book hoping it would give me basic information on color mixing, brush technique and composition.  It did not.  The book has some beautiful examples of the author's art but gives very little information as to how he got there.  It is not a step-by-step instruction book.  Mr. Greer does not tell how to handle the acrylic medium as for as how to mix and apply the paint to get various results.  If you are a beginning landscape painter looking for basic instruction in acrylic painting techniques, buy another book.  If you have the basics down pretty well then this book may be for you.  The author is a good landscape painter but not the greatest teacher 
 I thought this book was going to be like the first one - a 5 star new trilogy to give some air to the series - the thing is that it is full of small deviation from the plo trying to cover a minimun of pages instead of providing a good story. Be smart, keep the first one - 
 I really love the genre of memoire, and I do read a lot of them.  This book, however, failed to meet its mark with my on several accounts.  I felt that her spiral into addiction was really self indulgant at times, and that it just led to nothing for the book.  I think, really, this would be a much better short story than a book.  Her beautiful, yet redundant writing, about how long her addiction lasted, the brothals she served, her views about it, really made me wonder what the author wanted the reader to carry away from this.  I think that is the really self indulgant bulk of the story.  Maybe if there were more of a resolution at the end, it would make up for all of the beautiful gore she presents the reader.  I doubt it though.  Frankly, I'd have liked to know more about her loving family that really helped her and stood by her throught all her trials.  I think a memoire from their point of view would be more productive.  I felt mostly sickened by this sad account of herion addiction and sprial and love affair with prostitution.    If this would keep a person from trying herione, then it's worth that.  But as a well rounded, quality memoire, there are so many better than this that have more to offer. 
 This is a pretty good read by an exceedingly arrogant businessman who seems more often than not to forget that he failed and, moreover, is clueless why.  His knowledge of business is about 50th percentile.  His knowledge of government is at best 10th.  Lots of 50thth percentile businesspeople make it.  If you're naive about government - as Mr Kaplan surely was - about the best you can do is whine about that mean old Bill Gates while your company goes belly up.  Read it and weep -- or laugh 
 These pillows end up being cardboard wafes when laid upon with your head, even when you have all four on top of each other.  This deal was too good to be true 
 Ted and Elinor have been married and experiencing fertility problems.  Like most couples that are trying to have a child of their own, there are alot of emotions that both partners cannot understand.  Elinor is feeling completely useless and wonders why this is happening to her- and becomes ( understandably) wrapped up in her feelings, and well as her disappointment with her body that she is unable to conceive a child with her husband.  After failed attempts for IVF and other complicated fertility tries- she becomes very emotional and sad.   Ted- just withdraws from his wife and meets a woman- Gina and starts an affair.  Gina has a son that "falls in love" with Ted and he mentors him. Elinor finds out about both Gina and her son and Ted's extreme interest and sort of "completely distances" herself from Ted and everyone.  Now my problem with this story is this- yes, going thru something in a marriage such as infertility is terrible- The woman who goes thru 98% of all the tests, drugs- hormones- feelings on an extended level needs to be comforted more than her husband.  We know he loves her- but................. to have the author then have Ted have and affair and she has a child- I thought just would "stab" Elinor in the heart- then to make matters sadder...........Elinor becomes pregnant and again looses the baby.......  Well at that point- I just lost all hope for a possible happy ending and I finished the book- but wow- I think I needed some chocolate to something that would brighten up my day and my mood.  Talk about SAD  :  
 This book is slanted, negative, and disappointing. Unfortunatley, the author's political views and negativity permeate every paragraph of the book.    On page 6 she states, "I got sick right away.  Everyone does." She said that within days her chest felt bruised and aching from the job of staying alive..."  You get the idea.  Stay away from this book.  I love Afghanistan, and can't imagine why people have liked this book.  It is not the Afghanistan I know 
 I'm not usually so critical, but I was utterly disappointed in this book. The title is misleading. The '45 plans' mentioned in the title were not plans at all. They were at best 'general arrangements'. While overall dimensions were given, most 'plans' barely mention materials of construction and certainly didn't include an actual bill of material. Some of the illustrations were little more than crude, badly proportioned hand sketches.  I guess I expected more from someone who felt they were qualified to write a book. I would have to guess that this is the authors first book. Apparently the publisher wasn't paying any attention during this project. A synopsis of the book might read "throw some scrap material together and give it a cutsie name...I'll include it in my next book!! 
 I bought this hoping it would cure my busted Superdrive on my G4 iMac but when connected via the Firewire it would freeze any program I was using to burn cd's or dvd's.  I thought it might have been a messed up product so I returned it to Lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted.    I then thought it was my computer, but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old iPod and even worked when connected to my Lacie external HDD.  Finally figured that the product was defective after I purchased the Sony DRX-830 dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire.    This product however worked when connected on the USB port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless 
 me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films. And we do really like The Thin Red Line. But this was a real boring piece of film making.....The whole film was just one huge poetry reading and I prefer to read poetry from a book.....It just doesn't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by George Lucas.Even the battle scenes were just poetry readings..........Watch Thin Red Line instead if you are interested in this director's work...That film is a masterpiece....This isn't 
 one of the last of the biblical epics, this was a bomb in its initial release, and deservedly so.  the movie doesnt know whether it is de mille or italian realism, and most of the sequences (adam & eve, tower of babel) are either laughable or langorous (george c scott & ava gardner as abraham & sarah).  yet stuck in the middle is a fine half hour sequence of the story of noah, with director john huston casting himself in the one strong sequence in the movie: replete with the right mix of humor and awe.  that half hour isnt enough to recommend buying or renting the dvd, but if you can catch it on tv some day, its worth a half hour of your life. 
 This book was cute to look at, but completely useless. Seriously, who would do half of these silly ideas the author spouted? Dressing in your finest for dinner at home? Wearing a fancy silk robe? Using velvet curtains in the doorway, instead of on the window? Come on. By the tenth idea, I was bored to tears and regretting buying this book. Goodwill, here it comes 
 This is just one of those dvd's you wouldn't mind renting for family night with the kids. It's not scary or entertaining except for maybe (emphasis on maybe) She Bear. The reason this may be considered funny is because it's so lame. Like one of those B-movies that is so badly done that you can't help but laugh 
 Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of "Company" (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word "concert" or "soundtrack" in DVD title 
 A supposedly compassionate human being who boasts of a dog changing his life and then opting for the death of the dog...it is mind boggling to me, I can't believe it....but it is selling his books and I think it is cruel to the reader.  The world has enough tragedy, we don't need this 
 I bought the Cables To Go USB KBM Switch to replace a D-Link KVM that had failed.  This Port Authority KVM has neat features (auto-switching, switchable USB hub, auto-conversion of USB on all connected PCs to work with PS2 keyboard and mouse), but it delivers a poor image on my VGA monitor.  My HP f2105 plasma display's image is fuzzy and has ghost images.  I've not yet determined whether the poor image results from the KVM switch, itself or from the KVM-to-PC cables that accompanied the unit.   Either way, I wouldn't purchase this product again 
 I returned this camera after trying very hard to like.  Picture quality (movie or still) is totally unacceptable.  I did not even get one good still picture.  Forget about indoors video or still.  The falsh and video light are useless.  The overall quality of the camera is low. 
 Product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery.  As of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card.  How would you rate my review 
 I read Diana Palmer for a easy no brains love story this was not it. To many plots and relationships going on and not enough on the main couple. I give it 2 stars because its Diana Palmer 
 This book gets to the heart of what really constitutes a book review.  Does a book get X stars because it is grammatically correct?  Because the reader happened to like the subject matter?  Because the author is adept at using descriptive adjectives?  I don't really have an answer to that general question, so let me just say I gave the book a low rating because of the effect it had on me.   Frances Mayes obviously knows how to write well technically.  Nobody needs me to tell him that.  The problem for me was the way the author conveyed her choice of subject material.  She soon began to sound quite self-indulgent and self-absorbed with this "pert orange rind", that "meandering back road", this "raised fork" and that "riotous bougainvillea".  It felt eventually like I was reading about someone  partaking of a huge buffet of the senses.  Interesting for a short time, but for over 400 pages?  The book became numbing and repetetive.  Perhaps this is the result of patching together the various vacations she took over the 5-year period and using the same formula to convey the impressions of each one consecutively.  I would have enjoyed the book if it had been about 250 pages shorter and had concentrated on just one geographical location.  And if there had been more of the "location" described, and less of Frances Mayes' perceptions of it.  It really seemed as if she was writing for an audience of one; herself.           
 I was sent the first edition of this book even though a second is already out and has been for years.  Not disclosed that this was older edition 
 This book is reassuring of how common are the conflicts between parents and their adult children, and provides sensible explanations of the feelings of adult children. Ms. Isay also empathizes with the parents' legitimate feelings of hurt. But the solution suggested by this author is basically for a parent to bite their tongue,  control their facial and body language, and  pretend,  lest their adult child be offended.  This advice does not consider the tension and underlying rage that can build up in a parent that is also contending with all the issues of advancing age, to say nothing of the phoniness of the resulting "relationship".  The subtitle of this book should be "Stepford Parents".  I found it depressing and disappointing 
 I didn't care for this book and returned it. My child is only 3 months old, and I didn't find much for her here at all.  Lots of the text is devoted to nursery rhymes and songs.  The rhymes you can get from other  sources.  A lot of the songs are obscure, and there's no music. Not too  useful!  In addition, I found that the manner in which the text was  arranged didn't make the book user friendly. Games Babies Play is a better  choice 
 I will be brief.  The book has no scientific or logical foundation.  I will not bother to denegrate shamanism, but would say that while avoiding Western-centrist thinking may be meritorious, abandoning logic and sound evidence does the argument no service.   The author's professional identification crisis is amusing, and his abandonment of methodology makes this a good read for "Visionary Shamanic Trance" and "Chills & Thrills" (see reviews/personal testimonials below).  I have to think that your average English major with a leaning toward mysticism will think this book "far out," while any person who is serious about science and/or logic will only be seriously annoye 
 Not sure why the disk was so low quality.  The picture was fuzzy and sometimes pixelated.  I cleaned my dvd player and tried it again.  still the same problem.  so i tried it again on my other dvd player on a different tv.  still the same problem.  SG-1 is a wonderful tv series and would recommend the series to all sci-fi fans 
 I dislike purchasing books that offer more in the title than they deliver.  I would have preferred more specifics in this book than narrative generalities.  B/W photos were poor.  The promised section on booth design left me with more questions than answers. This book offers nice filler information, but if you're looking for nuts and bolts, look elsewhere 
 an amazingly bad movie. eddie murphy (who was funny in the 80s) manages the near-impossible: he makes jerry lewis seem sophisticated. now dont get me wrong; i love stupid comedy -- when its funny. murphy never convinces an iota here in the role of the HUGE professor klump. there is scads of humor to be mined in the struggles of fat people to fit into the normal world (take my word, i know about THAT) -- just recall oliver hardy's girth getting him stuck in a doorway during his attempt to escape bogeyland -- but murphy is merely contemptuous and nasty. well, contemptuous and nasty in a comedy i can accept, but it better be funny. this movie has a high spot on my list of the 10 worst i have ever seen. 
 I bought this expecting a little in depth step by step, but essentially it just says; "these are some of the programs and this is what you can do with them." ...it only skims different program's abilities to help an artist be productive. I was hoping for a good reference book to have by my side while using my wacom. But, rather, it seems going to the various online tutorials would have been a better choice for me.  And a good chunk of the book is dedicated to things other than lessons on how to use tools on your computer to be productive. there are far better books on how to prepare, write for, and publish your comic/graphic novel than this monstrosity. Plus it's entirely in comic form...not good for reference what so ever.   all in all extremely, I can't emphasize this enough, EXTREMELY disappointing 
 If you like unimaginative phony crap you'll love this book.  The proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable.  An antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers?  A DIURNAL and TERRESTRIAL mammal that for some God-forsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind?  Primates that don't evolve to fit man's niche, but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels?  The thing has got nonsense written all over it.  The "future animals" proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody, please find Mr. Dixon a liguist, and FAST!  Some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature's plausibility.  A vortex? A posset?  What jerk scientist of the future is naming these things?  Can he please be institutionalized?  I admit the pictures were well done and pre-teen children would probably enjoy this immensely.  I know I would've when I was 10 or 11, and there's nothing wrong with that, it's just that Dougal Dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids, chains of evolution, and ecological niches, but then converts to unscientific baloney around page 30.  All in all, I just don't think it's cut out for people over the age of 12 or so, unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures.  But in that case, why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution?  Why not pick up a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures?  I find that books intended to showcase the fantastic, do much better outside the realm of (somewhat-boring) science 
  I waited for quite some time for this book to come out, but I ended up  being a little dissapointed.  I love Loretta Lux, but I know this is not a full compilation of her work and I feel like many of my favorites were left out.  Maybe she's saving them up for "Volume 2" 
 I think the story wasnt that great.I didnt think it was very good because it was only about mainiac magee running away and him beating every one in all the sports 
 I borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read. It is the first Barr book I have read.  I did not like it because of several reasons.  First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much.   One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter.   Second, it was so mundane for a mystery.  The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.   Someone needs to give me a book of Barr's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk. (By that I mean words one would use in professions of integrity.)  
 It's rare you see such gushing praise for an essay collection, more impressive is the average length of these Amazon reviews.  It seems the reviewers like to look at their own words as much as this author does.    I didn't like this book for a simple reason.  There are better things to read than varied complaints and woes about changing times.  Sure, sometimes it is good but these lopsided views.... he is as focused on discontent as he is verbose.     If that sounds good to you, buy this book..... most people have stuff to do 
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 Sobibor and Samar are decent movies. Pacific Inferno is not worth the money, even if it is included with the other two 
 On the cover of this book is the warning:  "This title may offend some readers."  It wasn't the title but the language used by the writer which is offensive.  She is apparently from Georgia, a Southern state, but her resentment and low view of the wealthy and educated people show her status in life.  Even though it mentions such Confederate generals as Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate states at the time of the Civil War, (and Abraham Lincoln, the President of the United States at the time), the only thing about Dixie is the theft of a diary purportedly written by a Civil War madam.  It reminds one of the movie IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL which also takes place in Georgia what with two murders by a prominent collector of antiques.  Our investigator is a 'has-been' with the police department and now cleans houses for a living.  She is crude, calculating, and not very professional.  Not at all what I thought I was getting into, but a slight diversion off the path of knowledge.  At a recent talk about Nathan Bedford Forrest, a UT professor called him white trash, which I refuted most vociferously as he not only hadn't done his homework; he had Forrest as being from Memphis, and he was born in Chapel Hill, TN, (not too far from Shelbyville, home of the Tennessee Walking Horses), who proved to be one of the most brilliant officers and calvary tacticians of that war 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 I thought that this book would be enlighting, but it proved other wise. I began to read this book and felt myself bewitched, until something snapped in me and I said to myself "What kind of book am I reading!" I stopped reading the book and will never pick up another book written by Liz curtis Higgs: which is a shame for she does have talent to write books. Now I will tell you what i found in this book which is offensive.  In the beginning it says how the pregnant woman puts all her trust in God, but yet believes in silly superstition. Another thing is how Jamie falls in love with Rose just for her looks; that is not true love! - The father doesn't love his daughter's, just wants to marry them off. -Rose even says that she is not ready for marrige but yet goes against herself. -Jamie is Rose's cousin, but yet wants to marry her.(You are not allowed to marry family!) -Leana, for some reason falls in love with Jamie, how? Who knows. - If Jamie really did love Rose, he would of waited for her to come and then marry her, no matter what. But instead he asks Leana to take her place, which is the most stupidest thing ever, in other words he is not married to Rose in the eyes of the true God. - Leana commits the sin of adultery (Before doing this, she was asking for Rose's forgivness : if you know what your about to do is wrong then don't do it! - Her father threatens her, if she doen't get married to Jamie then she won't get married at all, as if Jamie was the only man on earth...   There is no romance in this book only stupidness, if you want true romance then read books by Dee Henderson or find another author who rights true romance. Don't waste your time on such useless books that only damages your soul and mind. You my just ignore all the wrong in this book, but if a person continues to read books such as these, it will be engraved into your thinking,and then you won't even see the sin in it, but accept as right.   
 I remember when Saturday Night Live did a spoof of Irene Cara from Fame singing the theme song from the movie as "Same:" "Same!  I sing the same song forever."  Maybe Peter should have gone that route instead of this album.  I just got through listening to it, and have decided he should never have left Chicago.  Sure, it's a nice, slick adult contemporary recording, but it's also the same exact song with different lyrics eleven times in a row.  Sometimes he duets with two females who sound exactly alike--Crystal Bernard (Hee-hee-hee, gimmie a break!) and Ronna Reeves, whose unique vocal style even manages to get the authenticity sucked out of it here.  Even his remake of the beautiful "Happy Man" from his Chicago days is reduced to an extremely unattractive entrail of itself.    So why 2 stars instead of one?  Production quality is key here, and it's nice wallpaper music for wallpapering by.  Beside that, it's Peter, and at least his voice is good.  Other than that, this is a lackluster piece of offal that I wasted under ten bucks on.  My second and last solo Cetera album, I suggest you steer clear of this album unless you find 11 versions of one song entertaining.  
 Alright. So I had intended to see this movie upon its release way back and just really never got to it. A week or so ago it was playing on Oprah's Oxygen network and I was very happy that I would finally be able to see it. Overall, it was alright. So then it was on again the next day and I couldn't stomach watching it again.  It may be called Brown Sugar, but the plot moves slower than molasses. It is way too predictable and sweet, with very little substance. It wasn't even all too interseting the first time around and I couldn't stand seeing it a second time. There's a reason why these movies are on TV, people. No need to purchase the DVD. As soon as I saw it once, I had gotten my dose and wanted no more 
 i am very displeased with this purchase because i have not received this book bought and paid for with the other books that i purchased and bought.  if i do not receive any response as to why i have not gotten this book, i will file a complaint with the BBB, Consumer Protection, and Federal authorities 
 There's some medical information which you could find on the internet but it is disconnected by any theme. Also, the author claims that it is proved that high carbohydrate diets cause insulin resistance and diabetes.(pg76) He obviously hasn't read "The China Study" by T.C. Campbell. Nor has he read "Mastering Leptin" by B. Richards, otherwise he would not recommend snacking as a way to lose weight. There is a lot of information about drugs and supplements for serious illnesses which may not be useful to the reader looking for the hormonal connection to weight issues. For that read "Mastering Leptin" and "The China study" 
 The reviews for this product are excellent and I was so excited to upgrade to HDMI switching.  The first unit received had a loud hum in the audio and HDMI from my new Sony player through this unit created an extreme blue cast on the video.  I returned the unit and another was sent to me.  This unit had no hum in the audio but the blue cast was still there when using HDMI from the Sony DVD player.  It was not the DVD player because when I hooked the HDMI from the DVD player directly to my TV everything was perfect.  I am very disappointed in this unit.  As for Amazon, they have been great in responding to my problems, getting a replacement unit to me and then refunding my purchase.  I give Amazon 5 stars 
 Cabaret extraveganza that takes much of it que from Madonna's Girly Show way back in 1993, not a bad effort but i prefer the Girly Show, ironically filmed in Kylies homeland! 
 Hated it. Read 45 pages. Aimed to read 75 before throwing in the towel, but couldn't make it that far. Not funny. Not clever. Not even especially entertaining. 
 i have read 5 graham greene books and this is by far the lamest of them. this was conceived of first as a hollywood movie, and it shows. the book is not much more that a silly, corny thriller (just what hollywood orders over and over and over). there is very little character development involved, & the the sense of place (vienna after world war ii) could have been given much greater depth, as well. this is simply a plot being rushed onto the big screen ( a half-baked, lame plot, at that) to make some cash. pass this one by. 
 Turn of the Century is so boring and slow moving that it's not worth reading. In the first half of the book, literally close to nothing happens. Added to which, Anderson makes the book so convoluted it's like a badly executed Altman ensemble drama. It's impossible to keep track of all of these characters and formulate a good idea of what they're actually like. Added to which, the highly trumpeted 'Tom Wolfe' style satire in the book is so blunt and obvious that one wonders how many made the connection between Anderson and the esteemed writer of 'Bonfire of the Vanities'. Bottom line: boring, dull and pretty stupid really 
 Much of what Tetlock writes about is trivially obvious - why anyone would believe that political "experts" actually are experts is a mystery in itself.  I expected a more polemical and combative work designed to destroy the obvious sham value of "expert" political opinion.  I couldn't even be bothered finishing the book it was so tedious.  This is not to say that others might be excited by Tetlock's insights.  Peter Haggstrom BONDI BEACH AUSTRALI 
 Agreed, the fan IS there, but I must admit they are actually singing well in the actual Solesmes style (based on these samples).  I have heard superb chant and frighteningly bad chant.  This is not as bad as it gets I assure you.  Try to find something from a Seminary or Monastery 
 I normally don't write reviews for books, but I had to for this one because it is so bad, as many others have said. I too am a Gibson fan. But I want the time spent reading this book back, I feel it was so wasted.  I almost put the book down, but instead I foolishly hoped Gibson would somehow tie all the scattered, half hearted events together in the end. As many have said, you never find out what this "nodal point" is. The payoff NEVER comes.  You don't get close to really any of the characters. You want to get close to Rydell, but there is not enough of him there. There is WAY too much jumping around.  And there is way too much of "look at what a clever writer I am" by writing incomprehensible "creative" prose.  I don't know why some writers - even great writers- fail to grasp the most important point about writing: It's the STORY stupid.   This book is a chain of events that are disconnected, unfinished and unsatisfying. Read some of his earlier works, sure, but don't pick up this painted mess, regardless of what the so-called reviews on the cover say 
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 I loved Sherbrooke Bride. I felt Ryder deserved an equally fascinating heroine and storyline. Instead the characters are flat, one dimensional drones. Sophie, the heroine is useless. The plot was thin and Coulter, obviously struggling for ideas, just fluffed most of the chapters with nonsense. I get the feeling she was in a rush to complete the trilogy and her heart and usual talent did not surface with this piece of writing. YUK. I'm generously giving her two stars because overall I enjoy this author. I couldn't wait for Hellion to end and had to struggle to finish it. Usually her pace is great and her novels are page turners. Disappointing 
 I got this book at chapter 11  knowing nothing about java wanting to learn it. i read it and am tottaly lost. it is stupid. it is just a book posing to be a turorial when its not. its just junk to copy out of the book that doesnt even work. so make sure u dont get it 
 This book is crap. If you want to read 254 pages of contradicting theories backed up by little to no fact, this is the book for you. The one interesting and revelatory thing that I did pick up from this book is that the work produced by modern physicists is largely insubsantial and speculatory. The theories presented to explain space and time are no better than those created by those ancient Greek thinkers and philosophers who happened to have been proven wrong about things, or perhaps those of your average back-alley lunatic. These physicists, who should more likely be called sophists, simply pull from their anterior regions fantastic, thouroughly imaginitive structures to apply to the workings of the universe, simply because they truly have no legitimate answers.   Seriously, I'm an average guy, though fairly well educated, and I'm telling you, if you're the snooty, self-important type of intellectual who likes to make up smart sounding stuff (yeah, I said "stuff") just for the sake of sounding intelligent, and would like to read this book simply for the sake of self-indulgence, then you've found the perfect read. Otherwise, steer clear of this long, boring, and incredibly redundant pile of feces 
 This slender paperback has a lot to offer in the food category, which is the main point.  The recipes were more gourmet and ethnic than I expected, with a lot of new dishes.  Even if you choose not to cook them in a tabletop/toastr oven, they're nice to have around for only 1-4 servings.  As for the books toaster-friendly side, I'm not so sure.  The authors give few special techniques or safety tips, a must for an appliance notorious for being a fire hazard.  Also, most small toaster ovens are hell to clean, making it questionable whether you'd want to broil a lot of greasey things like hamburgers in them 
 The Riftwar was a good saga.  Pug was good.  Tomas was good.  Arutha was good.  Everything was good.  Then Feist came out with this series...  Anyone who wants to know the plotline for this one just save yourself the money and read the Atlantis attacks comic books by Marvel, the Eternals by Jack Kirby, and the Fantastic #337-340 and then you'll easily see where Feist stole this storyline from.    A dreaming Mad God that influences a world around him, that's buried under a mountain, whose thoughts become reality?/A dreaming Black Celestial from a race of space gods who is buried under a mountain and can control reality around him and is trying to destroy the universe?  C'mon, I can't believe I'm the only who has seen this.  Everyone takes ideals from someone, hence Tolkien syndrome, but to couple it with this sorry book(ie a stupid book where a stupid Pug that throws fireballs but can't dodge them and can't time travel like in other books and can't deal with a minor demon captain)insults the people that made the Dreaming Celestial(KING KIRBY) and the Eternals.  If he was gonna steal ideas, he should have made the entire book worthwhile.  In this book, besides the old guard, Erik is the only guy we really care about.  Characters that were developed in the two lackluster books before are killed off before they have a chance to sign and we're left with characters like Miranda, whom we don't reall any thing for at all.  All in all, a very poor effort in the Serpentwar saga.  Feist gets an A for stealing storylines and an F for originality.  I'll stick to newer guys like Simon R Green, Aaron Mccarty, and Ferrenzano for new takes on fantasy/sci fi. 
 I was very disappointed with this CD.  Dean and Frank sound drunk throughout most of the CD and the audience detracts from the songs 
 With all the hype that this book got, I expected much better. As a basic matter, the book does not hold together.  The book cannot figure out if it is a general book about Cohen's strategic leadership theories, or a book about civilian-military relations.  Because Cohen is inconsistent in his aims, the book disappoints.  In the end the reader is left with some disconnected essays that may be individually interesting, but which don't support the overall thesis.  To give one example, while Ben Gurion (one of the four examples the author uses to illustrate his main thesis about civilian control of the military) may have been a great wartime leader, he was not attempting to control a professional military that had inculcated Samuel Huntington's (or Jomini's) theories about military-civilian separation.  The Ben Gurion example just does not fit with Cohen's theory, as interesting as it is to read all about Ben Gurion's terrific library and unusual personality quirks.  I read the paperback edition.  The best material was relegated to the appendices, another sign of poorly-thought-out and poorly edited book.  Cohen admits to having rushed this book into publication, and it's obvious.  He should have called this a collection of essays on leadership, and left it at that. The "grand unifying theory" he attempts to put across fails miserably as technical matter, along with being inconsistently argued 
 I feel so bad for PD James and so horrible for disagreeing with other readers but this novel was sub-par at best. It was incredibly predictable and very poorly written given PD James' talent. I gave it 1 star because I know she is capable of so much better! But as they say, every author has one bad book in them... this means I can enjoy all her others.. 
   I've seen MIB I numerous times.  What I'm trying to find out is this....what was the name of the song that Tommy Lee Jones had on 8-track? I know it was by Elvis, but I cannot figure out the name of the song.  Any help out there 
 In the surmountable aspect of Public Relation, no other device is poorly used, yet has the potential for greatness than Advertising. Advertising is, in all points of fairness, an extenstion of Public Relation... a broad yet clear message of what the company is, what the company sells, and what the company can offer you.  For these schmucks to ever think that advertising is not an extension of PR, or to think that it is not useful and "dead", shows how much they actually know about the business of Marketing. Advertising is a model vehicle for brand recognition, brand strength, and brand longetivity.  Any "advice" in this book is ultimately a reflection of their own personal greed... of course they want you to think advertising is dead and that PR is king.. because they are in the PR business.  Do not buy this book... it will be a waste of your valuable time, and it will ultimately doom you to failure 
 Talk about over-hype from reviewer #1!  This "manual" is thin on substantive content, with TONS of whitespace & whitepages to stretch it out to ~125pages. The documentation of the code should be available as a PDF with files on MATLAB's file exchange or on the publisher's website. Save yourself some $$. 
 This book may be clean and lack 4 letter words but  the writing style does not challenge the reader's mind. Plot is thin and the style is too monosyllabic for me. I prefer books from which I learn at least one new  word 
 I hated the baby bargains book but this one is WORSE. My pediatrician gave it a hands down and his only comment was "a few authors trying to make a buck." They obviously have no research in this book because they recommend products that are not even age appropriate. These authors have little credibility in my eyes and according to other reviewers, it seems the same. I was never a bargain shopper, really, I mean who is unless you have to be! But, if I was, I don't see this book as a bargain. 
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 I just want to let everyone know right now that this is not a good biography.  I'm all for the Bio that only concentrates in the career of the person in fact I prefer it to reading about their personal life.  but this book was just horribly self- indulgent and     un interesting to read even if you are a big fan of Johnny Depp's work.  so I would recommend saying away from this one cause there are plenty better bios than this 
 I would like to thank all of you here for alerting me (us) to the fact that these episodes are not in their original state and not in order. I love B&B, however, the more I love something the more I INSIST it is an original. Will pass until a release with integrity comes along 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 I agree fully with "A music fan" above ... this and David's self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work. I love most of Talking Heads music but don't rate Remain in Light highly like most fans do 
 i don't why anybody liked this book. the story line wasn't bad it was just that is was way to vague and not enough interaction with the characters. i mean there is hardly any conversation at all 
 This is an easy read... But you have to hash through a lot of common knowledge about the Bulls to get any interesting tidbits about Jackson.  Sacred Hoops gives you much more perspective into Jackson than this book does.  The author teases the reader with an opening story about how Jackson smokes two cigarettes and drinks a beer before he talked to the Bulls after a game... A great bit of informaion, but many true Bulls fans could have picked this up the the local papers or sports talk shows...  The author gets most of his inside information from Tex Schram, Johnny Bach, and Skip Schaefer.   The majority of the book is a general chronicle of the Bulls 8 year 6 title run offering few insights on Jackson.  If you followed the Bulls, read Sacred Hoops, the only 'fresh' information comes from the last two chapters about Jackson's year off and some information about Jackson's first year with the Lakers.  It reads quick, but do not expect learn any new in depth information about Jackson 
 I was not expecting this book to be nearly as funny as the Worst Case Scenario series, but even with low expectations, this book left me completely underwhelmed.  If you've read the WCS books, don't buy this one, its not even remotely amusing.  The scenarios are interesting to imagine, but the "tips" this guy gives do not have the same "over the top" humor that the WCS books have.  In fact, the introduction says "open the book to any page and you will find it so funny you will buy the book."  Not true at all.    One of the things that made the WCS books great is the illustrations.  This book features an old balding guy in every illustration (is he supposed to be the author?).    I only purchased this book because an Amazon 3rd party seller had it for 70 cents, which still seems like a rip off to me 
 I bought this book and read it; simply because the author is my ex-husband's therapist.  As with many self help books it touches only the surface of the problem and does not delve deep into what is truly happening and with a persons thoughts, actions, patterns and integrity.  People are not the same, we are all different, and therefore the thought processes are all different. What drives our actions and thoughts come from the many experiences we have had through our lives.     A formula might work for a short period of time, but the basic problem that needs to be addressed is not being addressed.  Therefore the basic problem is being ignored.  When it is ignored more often than not it will come up again and with a vengeance.    Many things that happen in our lives need to be recognized and understood with a professional who has "our" best interest at heart.  This is not found in this book.  The formula the Hendricks have put together is a quick fix with the problems still there and not dealt with. Therefore masking the issues.    So, I do not recommend this book.  I do recommend seeking out professionals who will actually work one on one or in a group setting directly with you, dealing with your issues.  This formula is just that a formula.  None of our lives fit into a nice neat little box.  But, it sure sells books.   
 I bought this book because a reviewer said it would teach people with Asperger's syndrome how to make and manintain eye contact. It doesn't. It just says you should make and maintain eye contact, it doesn't teach you how.  This book only tells you what society expects of you, so if you already know what society expects of you, but just cannot figure out how to do it smoothly, don't buy this book. If you already know stuff like, "pull up your pants before coming out of the bathroom", don't buy this book 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 I was given this book by my old English teacher, accompanied by high, exhaustive praise. But upon reading the first paragraph, I could tell this wouldn't be what I had set my hopes on. It truly is possible to get a generalized sense of what you're getting into with that first introduction, and what I found on that first page of Shanarra was an over-drawn, clumsily written length of description.  It honestly did not get better as the book went on. Pacing was a foreign concept to Brooks, apparently - hugely important moments happened within a few pages, sometimes even a few paragraphs, while you could spend double that following characters as they walked along. Transitions were sloppy, sometimes even using the word 'then' for lack of anything better, and I found that I was anticipating most of the plot 'twists' when they were first being hinted at. Deus ex machina should have been the catchphrase of the novel, and I will not flog a dead horse by going into how many things were ripped directly from Tolkien.  Shanarra is for those who found Lord of the Rings tiresome and tedious. For the rest of us, let's turn to other masters 
 I think Afghan Whigs is the worst band of all times after Cheap Trick.Someone said to me that this album was the best by them,did he drink some bottles of tequila before 
 As many of the other reviewers have said, Michael Baigent seems determined to make the most of his current Da Vinci Code-related notoriety. That particularly shows through in this book, which unfortunately is just a really lousy read. Baigent has showed previously (Holy Blood, Holy Grail) that he is actually capable of writing in at least a relatively compelling style, even if his contentions are fairly implausible. The Jesus Papers could definitely have done with some of this style - it gets so far off track in many places that its main contention (which is still basically the same as what he presented in Holy Blood, Holy Grail) is almost entirely forgotten by the reader. This is a pity - even though I don't believe for an instant that Jesus somehow survived the crucifixion, I was really interested to see how the story would be put together, and I was sadly disappointed by this effort.  Much of The Jesus Papers retreads some of the same ground covered by Holy Blood, Holy Grail, but without nearly enough detail presented. It then gets severely sidetracked via a brief history of Judaism in Egypt and a discussion of theurgy (where Baigent appears to think he's invented the entire concept that ancient religions purported to involve direct communication with the gods), to end up with a story of Baigent's cave-crawling adventures in Italy. Some of this stuff might have been moderately interesting in its own right, but a lot of it (particularly the bit in the caves) doesn't seem to connect to the main story in any logical manner. The other really frustrating thing is that every important document mentioned is either just tantalisingly out of reach, the subject of a government and/or Vatican conspiracy to hide it from view, in a language Baigent doesn't speak, or a combination of one or more of the above. The "Jesus Papers" themselves are mentioned only briefly, and of course the contents are untranslatable by the author, so they don't actually prove anything at all.  The other complaint I have - and a couple of other reviewers have mentioned this as well - is Baigent's tendency to entirely dismiss the validity of anything written in the Bible, unless it can be bent around to appear to support something he wants to say, in which case it is clearly a reliable primary source. Sorry, you can't have it both ways.  Either way, The Jesus Papers really isn't worth the time. If you want the full theory, read Holy Blood, Holy Grail instead. If you want well-written Biblical scholarship, pick a book at random and there's probably more in it for you than The Jesus Papers provides.  
 All this book does is tell the same spells over agian that are in the Players Handbook like Ivisibility or wish of Polymorph other so please don't waste your time with this boo 
 Yeah, ummm Disney, ya went wrong ONCE AGAIN!  This soundtrack only has three new songs as followed: Dancing on a Cloud (Demo) (Only really new track which is already on the DVD)   Beautiful (On Jim Brickman's The Disney Songbook CD)   Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes (On Disney Mania 3)   So if you already own the original soundtrack, Jim Brickman's awesome Disney CD, Disney Mania 3 CD, and the Cinderella Special Edition DVD... PLEASE skip this CD. Thank you! : 
     To start off. As a response to other reviewers referring to Marx's work, it is neither "simple minded" nor "myopic" any more than modern economic theory espoused by the Austrian and Chicago schools, even though Marx's historical insights may be naive at times. If you read anything past "The Communist Manifesto" (which was a political propaganda pamphlet and should be seen as such) this would become more obvious.       Turning to MacKinnon. She is a perfect example of how Marxism (I'm not talking about Marx here) got a bad name. From reading many of her law review articles I noticed an underlying tone of anger and hatred toward males (note how similar her arguments are to those of racists and mysogynistic men). This combined with her legislative attempts to severely limit 1st amendment rights through a pornography ban in a moral crusade to "save women from themselves" makes one think that perhaps  MacKinnon should have been born a 19th century man, where many of her arguments would hold more weight. Although she may claim to be "Marxist" or "Freudian" or whatever convienient label she identifies herself with to prop up her bankrupt theories , she is one of the most conservative and unenlightened thinkers in feminism today. Read forget about MacKinnon and read Simone De Beauvoi 
 If "Havoc" was Anne Hathaway's "all grown-up" vehicle, she needs to check the engine.  Hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as Bijou Phillips and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this drivel.  Hathaway and her friends, the "PLC" as they call themselves, are products of upper-class Palisades in California.  Bored with their seemingly bland lives, they adopt the "gangsta" mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize.  In truth, they're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable, snot-nosed posers.  We've all encountered this type before.  You see them at the mall wearing the most expensive "Rocca" wear and and "FUBU" even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing.  They think that they have no identity of their own, so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be.  In this tale, Hathaway's group has a run-in with a Latino gang.  Drawn to these outlaws, Hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an all-night party.  Hathaway then returns with one of her friends (Bijou Phillips), and the two take the downward  spiral into supposed gang life.  In the end, however, something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang.  Their actions cause a number of things to occur.  The results of those actions are status quo for their social status.  Although the film is pulled down by a lot of over-acting (Gordon-Levitt seems to have channeled Jamie Kennedy's "Malibu's Most Wanted" character, B-Rad), the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed street-tough Latino gang headed up by Freddy Rodriguez.  First of all, I'd think that a real gang would have taken out the "PLC" without flinching.  Secondly, had four "innocent" little girls actually made it into the gang's party, I'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance.  Instead, Rodriguez backs off on the posers of the "PLC" and seemingly falls for Hathaway's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang.  Full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie, "Havoc" is a dud.  Unbelievable, uneventful and definitely a rental 
 I find the mostly 5 star reviews of Adam Bede rather puzzling. I am a great of lover nineteenth century English lit, and have enjoyed the other three Eliot books I've read--Middlemarch, Silas Marner, and Mill on the floss, the latter being far and away my favorite. However, had I read Adam Bede first, I may not have bothered to read other Eliot works.   Eliot's talent is indisputable. The other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose, and many of those strengths are present in Adam Bede. What disappointed me most about this work were the characters. Each was far less complex than I have come to expect from Eliot, and I found the saintliness of Seth, Adam, and Dinah boring, almost irritating. It was hard to care about them. I also found, despite the explanations Eliot provided, that Adam's love for Hetty and Dinah's change of heart about marriage was implausible.  What sealed my opinion of this book was Adam's forgiveness of Arthur. After the devastation Arthur's actions caused, it would have been superhuman to forgive him, let alone regard him as a friend. When Arthur asserted that he suffered more than Adam, I could hardly believe that Adam did not recognize yet another expression of Arthur's massive ego.  Despite the book's strengths, this flaw, together with one-dimensional personalities of the main characters, relegates Adam Bede to an inferior status among Eliot's works.  
 While this dictionary does contain a lot of entries, it is English to Arabic only; there is no Arabic to English.  It does however show the short vowels, though the script is a little frustratingly small.  I took it back once I found out it was only a one-way dictionary.  The Arabic Practical Dictionary by Hippocrene is much better (though it doesnt' show short vowels however) 
 Less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition, this book more aptly excerpts the author's personal conflicts with human relationships.....a one-on-one wrestling match with the Self with no spectators and no judges. The book is a good read for academic analysis, but not so fun for venturist philosophy 
 An excellent release .... just don't buy this version. The Century Media release with the Bonus Tracks contains audio that appears to have gone through some kind of lossy audio encoding process (i.e. encoded to MP3 then back to PCM) before being sent to the manufacturing plant.  Avoid this one, check out the other versions and make sure you receive the full audio spectrum that you paid for. 
 Im comparing this album to social distortions self titled album so of course it is not near as good.  If you are going to buy this album make sure you listen to this BEFORE you listen to social distortions self titled because if you dont your gonna hate it like i did...honestly i wouldnt even buy it.  the songs are so-so but i think they could have done way better.  only two stars for me 
 After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house.  Aha, I thought, the story begins.  But alas, not much happens.  Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be.  Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no.   Danielle Steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them.  The story of the grandmother's life in the house would have been tremendous.  I think maybe she had a Visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly, because she did not put any thought into this one.  Where was the editor on this one?  It was a bummer.  Virgini 
 Purchased the item, arrived defective, replacement was also defective 
 I would have given this book no stars if I could.  My Bible study group and I went through Ransomed Heart and loved it.  I can't believe how disappointing this book is and I would not recommend it.  Mr. Eldredge hides his anger (barely masked), arrogance and deceit in this book.  Do not buy it 
 In "God Knows", Joseph Heller attempts to tell the story of King David through arrogant eyes.  Rather than finding David intelligent or witty, I just found him annoying.  In a long book, this is not a good thing.  The story seems verbose while lacking the strong social commentary of Heller's other works.  The attempts at humor made throughout the book missed the target for me because the characters were beyond my liking.  While I did find the occasional snicker on some pages, I found myself wishing for the pain to end.  The endless jokes about circumcision were almost as painful as the operation itself.  I have enjoyed Heller's other books including "Catch-22" and "Something Happpened".  To me, this book just missed the mark which may be why this is not one of his better known works.  Others may enjoy this book, but it is certainly not for everybody 
 A graduate program had the audacity to use this as a text.  I would say this is a solid community college level text, or perhaps an intro to communications text for a 4 year course.  Most definitely not a graduate course level text.  Don't expect to gain any particularly new insight into communication if your grad school assigns this text, although you could probably expect an easy A 
 Attempting to fit a subject as enormous as World War II into one single volume of history is no mean feat. Whether Mr. Leckie's book is indeed the first such endeavour is open to debate - it may well be the first American one-volume history, but by declaring his book a "first" without reservation, Mr. Leckie rather sets the tone for the entire account: This is a short version of World War II seen from a purely (and chauvinist) American point of view. The account furthermore suffers from factual inaccuracies, as the author makes every effort to belittle (or indeed ridicule) especially the British from Montgomery to Churchill, demonize the Germans and generally overlook the decisive effort of the Soviets. But even if the reader accepts the book as a history of mainly the U.S. war effort, the narrative is unbalanced by the excessive attention given to the island-hopping campaign in the Pacific. Mr. Leckie is, I believe, a former Marine himself, and his loyalty to his old corps is touching - but damaging to his credibility as a writer of history. The number of individual marines portrayed, the detailed decriptions of their weapons and equipment are completely out of proportion in a one-volume history of a conflict of this magnitude, especially when taking into account that - in the larger scheme of things - the campaigns of MacArthur and Nimitz were little more than a side-show. The only decisive contribution to the outcome of the war provided by the island-hopping was the securing of forward air bases from which the air offensive against the Japanese mainland - culminating in the dropping of the nuclear bombs - could be staged. Such bases might just as well have been secured in China had the Americans used some of the ressources poured into the Pacific to support the Chinese war effort. Still Mr. Leckie allows the Pacific campaign to outshine even the monumental American effort in Europe. Only in his description of the Yalta conference does Mr. Leckie achieve an objective evaluation of the American contribution to the war - and its sad aftermath. The author deserves praise for his severe criticism of how President Roosevelt and his entourage allowed their biases and idiosyncracies to cloud their judgement at Yalta, thus condemming half of Europe to communist tyrrany. Generally, however, the book seems in a sense oddly superflous: It is too subjective and selective as well as too factually flawed to be of use to readers who want to gain insight into the history of WW II by reading just one book, while it falls far below the scholarly requirements of those who wish to study the conflict in detail 
 The batteries that come with this charger we're not a problem for me.  In fact, I was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine.  I was however, disappointed in the charger.  The charger requires that all four AA batteries be in the charger for it to work.  You cannot charge just one, two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted. Also, there are a maximum of two slots for AAA batteries and when they are in use none of the other AA slots are usable.  Given the price of NiMH batteries, the charger works out to be about $2... which is about what it's worth at best. 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 This pendant looks great in the picture but when I received it, it looks like yellow glass, doesn't look like a crystal at all. I'm very dissapointed 
 this subwoofer is weak, very weak. My computer subwoofer did a better job than this. When the bass was heavy, the subwoofer cannot handle the bass, the air blow out from the subwoofer make noise rather than giving a solid bass, abd it ruin everything. 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 This product just doesn't have much variety.  My baby's both are completely bored in it, and have only used it a handful of times.  They are 5 months and 1 year.  She like noise makers and squishy toys, but these are all hard, boring toys ... at least to my kids 
 The book contains a chapter with advice on teen sex that is written is such a way as to authorize it as okay.  It doesn't encourage abstinence as a first choice. And it doesn't provide enough (or any) information on communicable disease.  I decided it was not appropriate for my for my 15 year step-daughter as guidance during her first year in high school 
 When I was a psychology major, Szasz's views made for intersting conversation.  Having been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and later having worked as a mental health advocate, his views are punitive and cruel.  How sad that fascinating often outweighs truth 
 I connected all the cables as instructed, but it doesn't work, the light is not on. So I return it to Amazon 
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 Save your money and buy a beatuty product instead.  This book is very repetative and has not much content.  You can find more and better info on the net.  In my opinion produce is much too expensive to be used as beauty products.  I would rather eat it.  I do not feel like putting milk on myself, lemons everwhere, drinking diluted vinegar, scrubbing with coffee grounds.  Yeah you cover up dark roots on your hair with eyeshadow. If you heard the promo on TV about what was in the book that is about it that is it not much more info.      In case we did not get it the first time they keep repeating the same thing over and over and over again 
 Oh, my word, this book is simply terrible. We read it in my English class during my senior year of high school, and I absolutely hated it. I read it merely for the sake of my grade. It was difficult to visualize half the book, and the parts I did understand were just horrible. I hated how the boys shifted to such barbaric behavior on the island. And the author's writing style, no offense, was awful, with a capital "A". I sure was relieved when my class finished the book, and I made a vow to never read this book ever again, if I could help it. If you haven't read this book yet, then take my advice and stay far away from it. Don't waste your good money on such a shoddy product. 
 This book is terribly repetitive and trite.  There are 3, maybe 4, pages of material that are worthwhile.  I am sure it is just a rehashing of the same thing that Zelinski "writes" every 3 or so years when his funds start to draw down 
 The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character.  It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene.  The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars.  The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story.  Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to "tighty-whities."  They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one 
 Although Speaker for the Dead is a decent story overall and does have some great sci-fi elements, like relativistic space travel, I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as Ender's Game. I thought of it like Return of the Jedi if the rebels spent the whole movie pondering the social behavior of the ewoks.  Of course we're not talking about Star Wars or movies here. Speaker for the Dead was just a peculiar departure from Ender's Game, which is one of the best novels I've ever read. I almost felt like Card decided he didn't really feel like writing another sci-fi novel, so he went with a biologist drama instead 
 Basically a recital of accomplishments and events, with next to no detail about most of them.  The only thing he really goes into depth about was his trial before the King's Bench.  Also, it appears to be writtin almost on a 6th grade level.  Not impressed at all 
 I like almost all of Lifetime's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best. The name bring "obsessed" was not what it should have been called, the lady was dreaming and had an illness. This movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through, this movie was not what I had expected. As I said I like almost all of Lifetime Original Movies but I definitely wan't be watching this one again.  
 What is this novel, The Marble Faun, that so many have said they "just simply must read" before travelling to the continent?  There seems to be some confusion about it, not only in my mind, but in the minds of others as well.  I know, at least that the publishers have had their questions.  Why else would they be unable to agree on a title?  Even though they may have agreed to publish the book, the British publishers spoke their mind at least and changed the author's title to Transformations.  After publication I'm sure they had wished that they had changed more than that.  It seems that the publishers also had to search for a selling point for the novel.  The prose alone could not carry sales, so they have added photographs and made it "the great travel book of our age".  Of course, I dare say people are buying the book more for the pictures than for the story itself.  The anticipation of seeing the piazza where Hilda's tower stands has intrigued the reader more than the murder, and the characters' subsequent transformations and loss of innocence ever could.   The story itself, centering around the actions of the four characters seems long and confused.  The characters float between scenes acting as they would anywhere else; the changing backdrops seem to act only as a way of keeping the travelling reader's attention.  Although Hawthorne makes sure you see that the four characters do in fact change (in such chapters as "The Faun's Transformation"), the characters seem to be simply caricatures, over-exaggerated looks at one type of person.  This is also accentuated by Hawthorne's use of epithets - such as "The Sculptor", "The Dove," and "The Faun".  Because of this the book has the air of being a presentation of four friends' romp through Italy, rather than being the intricate tale of four characters' lives and relationships.  One may wonder why Hawthorne chose to publish the Marble Faun in one volume rather than serially, as is common for his contemporaries.  The answer to me seems clear.  If a reader were to ever put this book down, he would not have the heart to pick it up again 
 I settled down for a nice read on what I expected to be a good, thoughtful expository writing on the sermon on the mount.  The book dove right in, beginning with the Beatitudes (great), but the waters seemed to be muddied by references to "metaphysics", "scientific Christian thinking", and focus on miraculous healing through some "special" prayer skills (I personally agree that God heals in response to prayer).  By page 30, with references to "reading rooms", I finally (duh) figured out that I was reading a book promoting the denomination and agenda of Christian Science.  I even skipped ahead to familiar but troublesome passages in the Sermon, looking for some insight from Fox.  I found nothing useful or especially insightful.  Now, of course Mr.Fox certainly has every right to publish what he wants, but I felt that his Christian Science message was in this case hidden in the Trojan Horse of a book on the Sermon on the Mount.  It seemed to not be the forthright way to present his position.  Fox is certainly on to something in refuting the dumb old western Christian religious systems, but still misses the mark in my calulation.  Theologcally, I belong to no denomination and am open-minded in the extreme, TO THE EXTENT, that propositions are within the bounds of the canon of Scripture.  I think that what I read in a few dozen pages of Fox does not nearly meet that test. 
 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.    Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.    Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film.   In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)  The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better 
 I hate country music....I bought this as a gift for a friend 
 Albright has certainly accomplished a task few dance history scholars have: she gives us a comprehensive approach to dance from a variety of theoretical perspectives.  However, I find her narrative style elliptical, and I also find fault with her seemingly overzealous application of theory.  Albright applies many of the theorists currently en vogue in academia to dance study, often with great results.  On the other hand, the variety of rubrics she uses obscures the most important part of her study: her point of view. Her pairings are stimulating, and certainly evocative.  Yet what results is a good amount of speculation, not firmly grounded in rigorous historical/cultural research or in choreographic analysis.  I found each chapter glittered with fascinating ideas and concepts which could have been better fleshed out. Albright presents those interested in applying theory to dance with an interesting challenge: how can dance theory change its reputation from being a field of dilettantism to a field of scholarship?  I think the first step is to set out a cohesive analytic frame from the start of a study, rather than throwing a hodge-podge of post-structural/post-colonial theory to bat against a corpus composed of two hundred+ years of history and thousands of works 
 I like to find movies in which current "stars" were not yet household names.  I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in such recent films as 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing' and this plot line of one of her earlier films, sounded humorously entertaining.    Kate plays an orphan, Flora Poste, who goes to live with your long lost cousins at Cold Comfort Farm.  Flora likes organization and finds very interesting ways of making her cousins see their true paths in life (often leaving the farm to do so), while simplifying and keeping her life organized.  She's a very charming control freak.  The film has a true, understated British humor and charm with many great one-liners, but I can't say that I found the film to be "hysterically" funny, nor worth the repeat view.  I strongly suggest Greenfingers (Clive Owens) and Saving Grace (Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn) as alternatives in the category of "not yet a household name". 
 First I quit buying books with Ludlum's name on them, then I quite reading them . . . that was years ago and this mess brings it all back.  I received the Bancroft Strategy as a birthday present from my daughter who takes gift-giving very personally, so I had to keep it.  The only reason I give it 2 Stars is because I'm still reading it, waiting for two DeMille books I ordered to arrive.  The stuff in this book is just plain D U M B.  Definitely don't waste your money, and don't waste your time, unless you have a good reason to do so, like someone else's feelings 
 Another badly-researched fantasy. Wolfe may understand the principles of modern, Neopagan magic (she seems to) but she clearly doesn't understand the basics of Celtic Pagan symbolism. Misleading and innacurate 
 As "Everyman" opens, the main character has already passed away.  From here, the plot moves back and forth in time to see how his life has come to this point.  This includes three unsuccessful marriages and strained relationships with offspring.  Ultimately, "Everyman" concerns how quickly life can pass us by- how death can come and people can be ill even when they feel they should be young and healthy.  And that's just not fair.  Quote: "My God, he thought, the man I once was!  The life that surrounded me!  The force that was mine!  No "otherness" to be felt anywhere!  Once upon a time I was a full human being."  I honestly cannot figure out what it is with folks and this book.  I did not find it to be interesting, nor the characters compelling.  Although I realize that the point could be made that in titling his work "Everyman" Roth is insinuating that the main character is actually representative of any man (who might not be a good man at all), I cannot find this convincing considering that I am unsure of whether the average man early has passionate affairs with European models thirty some odd years their junior . .  . maybe they do.  The virtue of this book is in its look at how an average man reflects on his life and death, but this man is not "average" enough for that to be pulled off here 
 National Geographic Magazine is famous for their excellent photography; it is the very reason I picked up this volume. However, Wide Angle: National Geographic Greatest Places failed to live up to my expectations. I was underwhelmed not only by a large portion of the images, but mostly by the poorly executed concept. In a title that clearly implies these are the greatest places featured, I felt the chosen photographs illustrated some lackluster locales. Furthermore, the organization was too loose. The book could have benefited from better formating not only of its categories, but of the photos themselves, which are often stretched in an unflattering matter.  
 I am a doctoral candidate and basically this book is not telling me how to write my dissertation and complete it giving 15 minutes a day to the writing (let alone the research) but really how to overcome blocks and start writing. Haven't we all been there, done that already?  To me, this book didn't offer anything I hadn't already read, figured out or been taught. Perhaps it would be a good book for procrastinators, but not for me 
 Janet Evanovich has become a much better writer since writing this book....I prefer her Stefanie Plum series and hope she doesn't give up on them. 
 I have to say that I am not familiar with any of the old Shaft episodes, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of Shaft prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed! The acting is about average with the exception of Samuel Jackson who carries out his performance very well (as always), and Jeffrey Wright who really steals the show as Basquiat, the gangster.  Regarding the plot, it is weak; the chances that the character, Walter Wade Jr., would provoke and then deliver as he does are way beyond "slim!"  The desperate need to demonize what W.W. Jr. represents gets tiring after the first 1000 or so movies!  Enough is enough!  The same applies for main characters with "chips on their shoulders!"  Let's move on please! As for having Vanessa Williams (who is GORGEOUS!) play in this film and not have a single nude scene (in this R Rated movie!) with her is such a WASTE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. 
 I have the Bad Cats book and love it, that is why I bought the calendar. I did not realize the pics were in black and white. If I had known that, I would not have bought it. Like another reviewer stated, they should have put that in the description. I would not recommend this calendar. Hopefully next year they will make the pics color or they wont sell many 
 I found this one to be very predictable! I don't ususally come up with the ending until very close to the end. But, with this one, I figured it out right off the bat! It was too easy! It was an okay read, but very easy to figure out 
 I was so offended with this book. I agree with Bruce in regards to the conservatives and how they shape our image. But to put blame on the activist and the more eccentric gay people is just ridiculous.  I was both an activist and eccentric and let me tell you I fought for my rights every day of my life.  I am proud of this struggle because I never compromised myself to fit in and appear normal....and I know my example has played a small part in changing this world for the better.  Those so called mainstream and normal gays are enjoying life because of people like me.  We fought the fight while they sat back and pasted judgment...how dare they.  The reason the activist and eccentric gays appear to shape the gay image is because they are the brave souls! If you want the world to know that we all aren't that way then get your normal, mainstream ass out of the closet and do your part.....how can you expect the people to know that not every one gay is eccentric and an activist if you guys are always hiding behind closed doors in fear. In my opinion you normal wannabees are the real threat to gay freedom 
 Well written, as always, but no originality, too many 'deja-vu' and just too unrealistic 
 I find the entire story to be contrived.  I know of many people who work in the area of psychology, psychiatry and mental health. Personally I have a degree in Psychology and currently work in the field. There is little evidence in the book that would be a grounds for so many years in institutions! My feeling is there is more illness than is being relayed, classic Sociopathic symptoms come to mind.I fear this kind of diatribe aimed at institutions will hurt the field of mental health and I believe it will harm the gay population as well for allowing fiction to be exemplified as actual experience of a young lesbian woman as I highly doubt she was institutionalized for being a tom- boy. There are too many true and terrible stories that need to be recognized, not this false memoir 
 First, beware, this book is largely about the towns surrounding Yellowstone.  It has 30 pages on Grand Teton, 90 pages on Yellowstone, and 180 pages on areas outside the parks.  The entire Yellowstone section is lumped into one item in the Table of Contents which means that to find say "old faithful" you have to either check the index or flip randomly through the book.  Lastly, the lack of detail was appaling.  For example it said only that Canyon has "various stores and eating places."  Such as?  A place to get a sandwich? A place for a nice dinner? A store with a good selection of camping gear?  No way to know until you get there.  I skimmed this book before I left but I was in Yellowstone for a week and barely opened this book because I found it so frustrating.  
 This is anything but an even-handed approach to the issue of trauma, particularly in the case of repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse. The principle reason I have given it more than one star is the fact that while the author ignores one side of the debate (except for the purposes of setting up a what Logic 101 would term a "straw man") he does quite well in covering the bases (and more) on his own side. Were one to this book in conjunction with another, the arguments of which were equally biased yet well stated, one might have a decent basis on which to form an opinion. A good example of a similar pairing might be to read Lenore Terr's "Unchained Memories: True Stories of Traumatic Memories, Lost and Found" along with Elizabeth Loftus' "The Myth of Repressed Memory." Neither are quite as unbalanced as this particular work but perhaps this may lend them more credibility 
 I brought this book to Paris along with 4 others, and although had high hopes, I found it frustrating.  It didn't provide enough choice within a geographic area, and with respect to our one "big night" out, led us to a disastrous, expensive disappointment.  Alcazar(p. 51) had miserable service (she had billed it "exquisite") and a meal that had to go back.  We did much better following Rick Steves' recommendations, and our own noses.  If it's the third or fourth book on your list for Paris, as it was for us, save your money and the aggravation of carting the hefty thing around.  It's not worth it 
 This is the worst finance book I have ever seen. For a book used for a MBA finance course it is not very helpful at all. If you are not a finance genius this book is definetly a no no. The examples leave you clueless and the theory is very general. Dare to try and solve the unrealistic sample problems at the end of the chapters, and a lot of the solutions in the solutions manual are WRONG! The professor who taught the Finance class, who has been in the field all his life and has a doctorate degree in finance admits this book is garbage and not appropriate for the MBA; beacuse of this we did not even use the book for his course. This is a very expensive and huge book and so not worth the price. I learned nothing 
 Whenever I read a book and find obvious errors that I know about, and I am not even an investigative journalist, I wonder what else is wrong about it.  Ms. Nasar, it's Jacob Wirth Restaurant in Boston, not Jack Wirth and the law firm was Choate, Hall & Stewart, not Steward 
 The jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap-stick sight gags. I normally wouldn't have bought a movie like this but I needed it to make my Johnny Depp library complete 
 Somewhat disappointing - too general.  I probably will not ever open it again 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 Anderson does have an insightful grasp of the male psyche, but her tight focus on what women can do to make men happier (and in turn the women will be happier for making their men happier) neglects to even consider what women can do directly to make themselves happier.  There is too much "wait at home til your man comes home and have the kids all ready with their hands washed, and make sure dinner is ready when he is... if he's not ready, give him space, etc."  There isn't enough respect for a female's independence.  In 2006, there is nothing wrong with your man waiting until you are ready to see him, or conversely, for him to make himself ready when it's convenient for you even if he's not ready yet.  This is not the 1940's-- men and women can live and compromise, and this book focuses too much on a return to old world ideals that are no longer possible, relevant, or helpful in a modern society.  But like I said in the intro, there is some useful insight into the male psyche, if you can get past the nauseau of the women should stay at home and clean theme.    
 John Wiley & co owes me a couple of pages full of errata or, at least, my money back. (I note there are, at this time, 23 used or new copies of this book) Books on options strategy and management with plenty of FX examples are few and far between. The only thing good about this book is that the chapters are bite-size. I'm only about half-way thru the book, but if I can expect a similar number of errors for the rest, then shame on John Wiley for allowing this book to publish before extensive editing.  Two handfuls of errors may not be much, but 79.95 is a lot to pay. Lucky for me I have a pretty strong grasp of the basics, but what if a beginner interbank trader got a hold of this book? It's surprising that someone of Nassim Taleb's eminence would lend his name in editorial reviews of this book 
 I too read the TA for Tots to my 3-5 year-old 30 years ago.  She loved it a lot so I've been looking for it again, this time for my grand-daughter.  Even though the title is different from the original one I knew, I purchased it and  read it as soon as I received it.  Bottomline: this story is _not_ the original one and I don't like it at all.  Other than showing stereotypical Happy Prince and Princess fairy tale characters (which I can live with up to a point), I saw bunches of red flags when I got to the evil witch, drawn with a full-blown ugly face "who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan".  Unhappy because there are so many happy warm-fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies.  Without enough warm fuzzies (we read earlier) it puts people "in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die".  Ouch.  So instead of embracing the wisdom of old women, here we have another story that villifies them (OK, I'm a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all).  No, it's not funny, and there is no way I would introduce this book to any child.  The book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are, as the original book did.  Too bad, for using images of "warm fuzzies" and "cold pricklies" is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children.  I am returning the book. 
 In the begining of this book its was adventursum and kept you on the edge of your seat but I started to get board around the middle and had to put it down. The story line of this story was interesting and exciting in a  mysterious sort of way but really isnt worth reading. If I were you I would  skip the reading of this boo 
 I thought I was going to see something of Roy Orbinson.  It was only in the title of the name.  I could not watch it when it became vulgar with offensive material.  It is too bad to have a good story with great actors lowering its potentially good quality with such degrading vulgarity. There are better ways of getting this aspect of the story across with such depiction.  Silly me, I should have checked the rating.  I "assumed" it safe as it would involve our beloved Roy Orbinson.  I was sadly and horridly disappointed and cannot in conscience recommend it to anyone at anytime.  By the way,I destroyed the tape in good conscience.  Watch at your own eternal risk 
 I usually enjoy Anne River Siddons, but this book just left me unsatisfied. I thought the twist at the ending was just silly (with Paul and Fig). I have to say this is my least favorite of Siddons' books so far 
 I will not try to say that I asserted the painstaking, analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of Heidegger. More than that, I have no interest in doing so. It is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being (existence), and my reading didn't lead me to any other conclusions. So as I said I have no interest in reading this a second time, further, deeper, or slower.  Being and Time is chock full of invented terminology, to the extent that Michael Inwood was able to profit from his publication of A Heidegger Dictionary. Whatever you might think the word "world" means, for instance, is not what Heidegger means, and he will explain that to you throughout the duration of an agonizing 40 pages or so. This is the case with his entire vocabulary. If there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by Heidegger, I would not bring this up as a crticism.  Beyond the unventilated, severely sober, and utterly uninspiring character of Being in Time, I also call attention to the futility of it's project. If Heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being, perhaps more than 2000 years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him: that there is no question of being.   Why is "the question of being" so problematic? Because it is unanswerable, maybe. Or if it is answerable, we're not in any position to answer it. "Being" implies some kind of unvarying stability that just doesn't make sense. And if you posit an idea that is so concrete, so constant, you can't just bend it to make it fit reality. You've already betrayed your questioning. Truth, including the truth of being, is a local phenomenon. Truth is not always and forever true - it's true when it's true. But Heidegger wanted an everlasting truth, a dogmatic anthropology.  Worse than the general uselessness of his project, and the toxic dregs left in his wake, Heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an intersting or thought-provoking way 
 This is an OK CD. Not one of his better efforts. The best song on this CD, Boats To Build was of course not written by Jerry Jeff but by Guy Clark. It is very dissapointing to see Jerry Jeff's lack of original songwriting in recent years. His best stuff has always been songs not written by him but atleast he used to write a decent song once in awhil 
 Janet Evanovich has become a much better writer since writing this book....I prefer her Stefanie Plum series and hope she doesn't give up on them. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed reading Nancy's book, and it sounded as though it would be the perfect answer for my fitting problems. But, when I tried to utilize her techniques, nothing fit at all. It was a big disappointment 
 This is one of those books that is so bad you don't forget it, because it is so misguided and pernicious.  Freire thoroughly misreads Hegel and doesn't much understand Marx.  It astonishes me that it is still in print: it has the dated quality of a mid-1950s Soviet textbook on Marxism-Leninism and more than a whiff of the arrogance of the messianic monsters who end up as Communist dicators. And the translation is lousy 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 I have owned two books on "places to live" -- this one on retirement and another on general living areas, thus I have a good basis for comparison. This book on retirement is mostly anecdotal and insufficient to make an adequate factual comparison among the various cities and towns. Why did the editor leave out the average cost of living for several of these cities, for example? My other book had numerical ratings for all sorts of critically important categories like weather, access to colleges and universities, health care and hospitals (public and private), public transportation, indoor and outdoor recreation, the arts, state sales taxes, state income taxes, property taxes, housing costs, general cost of living, etc. The editor of this book includes some of this information but it is not consistent and not in any type of graphical or rating form so it is impossible to compare the various cities, which is what we are inclined to do if we are choosing some place to retire. Another caveat: I think every book on retirement should have big bold letters printed on the cover, in red: WARNING!! NEVER COMMIT TO A NEW CITY UNLESS YOU RENT THERE FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS!! Based on just a few vacation visits to our chosen retirement town, plus information from this book, we spent two months renting, found and bought a house and have regretted it ever since. The glowing and gushing tales quoted about city and town life from every corner of the country in this book can be countered by equally dark tales of horror (we have more than a few about Whidbey Island, WA). So do you see why I think those human interest stories that fill the book are truly useless in helping you choose your final destination? I also lived for five years in Ojai, CA, one of the editor's favored towns, and I wouldn't want to be buried there, much less step foot there ever again. What is one woman's hell is another's paradise. A book of dull yet solid statistics would have been much more useful, in my humble opinion. Oh, wait, I have just the book you need, easily ordered from Amazon! Try "Cities Ranked & Rated" by Bert Sperling and Peter Sander, 2004. No meaningless subjective blather from gushing residents, just the facts, ma'am. Try it, you'll like it 
 Sister of My Heart is one of my all time favorite books--I love everything about that book and that is why I was so excited to discover the Divakaruni wrote a sequet to it. But after reading it I wish I had not. Yes, it was nice to have so many of the questions, left over from the first book, answered but this book ruined the characters for me.  My review of it has nothing against Divakaruni as a writer, she is extremely talented and gifted but I hate where the story ended up. I also hated that I no longer cared for the characters. Overall I found it to be just ordinary and almost forced.  As far as this book is concerned I would have liked to be left in the dark 
 McCann wrote a rich, detailed and realistic depiction of Cromwellian England.  She has an eye for detail that made me really REALLY want to like this book.  Unfortunately, the main character is a self-obsessed whiner who constantly sabotages himself.  I wanted to like him, and I wanted to root for him, but toward the end of the book, I had a hard time seeing his story through to the end.    This is an excellent book for people who like endings where little is resolved, and who like having to read the last chapter three times in order to figure out what happened.  It's also good for people who enjoy dark, cheerless tales with their protagonists self-absorbed and incapable of moving past their mistakes.  I don't want to be too harsh on the book, but it's just not my cup of tea 
 I have read 2 other chem book and found this book is my least favorite. 
 I bought this book at the recommendation of my favorite magazine...Good thing I used a gift certificate and didn't waste my own money.  I gave it 2 stars, but maybe it's worth 2.5 stars-just for the effort. It does have some good ideas, but for the people like me, who love to organize but just don't have the space, it's not that useful. I was expecting more ideas about how to use the space I have. Unfortunately, I usually have better and more creative ideas than the author. Another major "-" is that the book talks a lot about throwing stuff away; well, what I have to say to that is that I periodically do that anyway, and I still am space challenged. That's not the solution to every problem 
 Biting, cynical, accurate ... but not that funny.  Try Dave Attell's "Skanks for the Memories" for more laughs or Patton Oswalt's "Feelin' Kinda Patton" for better political and edgy comedy 
 Was not helpful in starting, had to have someone show me. Wouldn't recommend the book 
 This venture into the murky waters of historical speculation and machine-consciousness debates does tell you a few things if you are unfamiliar with Turing and Wittgenstein (otherwise, don't bother reading it). But while Turing's viewpoint is clearly stated from the start, Wittgenstein's is only done justice at the end. The other three characters in the book could be merged into a single one without any loss, and in general the entire book's message could be condensed in a few pages. Which would be pages worth reading if you like articles in easy-reading popular science magazines (which I have nothing against, and indeed subscribe to) 
 Well, the title and all the editors' reviews made me buy this book without hesitation. But now I know better. This book offers very few insights into the world of prostitution and sex industry. Some stories on the side are very uninteresting. And it keeps the climax building it and when it's time to reveal it, it's wrapped quickly in the last two pages leaving sooo many important questions unanswered. So basically what is written is not as important as what should have been written. I don't recommend 
 Boney used to be the man, but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him. Anyone who thinks this CD is good should listen to his older stuff like Seduction, Trust, or Backbone. You will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential. Cmon'Boney lets get back to multi-dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of. Peace 
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 2 1/2 stars  For the most part many of these songs demonstrate the colder, more distant aspects of pop songwriting, however warm the "vibe" would have us believe, with their autopilot musicality and predictable tunes. On the few songs that do feel more inspired then the generic majority, it is definately possible to see future pop majesty this band is capable of achieving, albiet it in a watered down farmiliar way to anyone who has ever picked up an older Belle and Sebastian album, whose shadow will hopefully prove underwhelming on future releases.   
 Before you buy this book, please take note of the problems which have come from it.  1. The Bancroft Prize which this book won in 2001 was withdrawn in 2002 due to the fact that Bellesiles "had violated basic norms of acceptable scholarly conduct" during the time when he researched and wrote the book.  2. Bellesiles was employed as a professor of history at Emory University until he was forced to resign due to "unprofessional and misleading work" that he put into this book.  3.Bellesiles said in an interview with a National Review reporter that he used "San Fransisco records from 1849-50 and 1858-59", but when the reporter confronted him with the fact that those documents were destroyed during the Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906, he claimed that his memory was bad and told the reporter to check some libraries, when she did, they did not have the documents either.  In conclusion, this book is a fabrication, and anyone who has studied the history of the United States military from The Revolution to The War of 1812 to The Civil War knows that the majority of units were militia, made up of citizen soldiers who armed themselfs, due to the culture that didn't love guns, but saw them as useful tools, and quite often at that. But Mr. Bellesiles does not want you to know that, so that he may infleuence political opinions 
 I think this book is worse than the others written by Savage-Weiner, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately, most reviewers never bothered reading this book.  On page 2, I am reminded why I hate this guy. Observing "while I'm no military tactician," he forgets to point out he was dodging the draft picking flowers in Hawaii while I and others were serving in Vietnam. He then states, "we still had to fight the real war, a guerrilla war--something our nation does not have the stomach for." Oh, please dude, people like you and your followers don't have the guts to serve. Like on page 10, where he forgets that people like Ted Kennedy at least served in the Navy during WWII. You may disagree with his politics, but at least the Kennedys had the guts to serve.  Skip ahead to page 172 (you ain't missing much) for more of his idiocy on Vietnam. He states, about the Vietnamese, that "in the sixties, no one really knew who they were." Well, he didn't, but 3 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War did. That's what happens when you sit out the war of your generation. He also erroneously claims that Vietnam "was a civil war." At the time of the war it was considered communist aggression. Conservatives of the sixties, like me but not him, knew about the communist threat. This is also the same page where Savage-Weiner claims "Iraq was not a civil war." Where have you been lately?  The "Afterword" really says it all. On page 203 he claims, about liberals, "for far too long you have lived in a cage where liberal ideas--and only liberal ideas--are expressed." He is really talking about himself and his followers. At least liberals, by definition, read and review all points.   For all those who hate "liberals," I would like to remind them that our Founding Fathers were the liberals of their day. A real Patriot of our Revolution (one of my real ancestors in Virginia) would have burned his house down and sent him packing on his big honking yacht.   
 These knuckleheads define 'failure' as honesty, integrity, candor, having standards, and 'swinging for the fence' in terms of striving for excellence. All of this turns people off and intimidates them. It's true, I see it everyday in the work world.  But H.L.Mencken was generations ahead of them when he observed, in the 1920s, that real success in the work world only requires gross incompetence & the teachery of a snake 
 Of all the books written on the Reagan administration, this one may be one of the worst.  Poorly written with excessive attention to detail that makes the story plod, it makes one wonder if Frances Fitzgerald was a one hit wonder.   Fitzgerald's portrayal of Reagan as out of step with reality - starting with the book title and included throughout its content - is less of a description of reality and more, I suspect, the blowing off of ideological steam.  If you despise Reagan and think he was a dunderhead this book will do more than reinforce those beliefs.  If you want an intelligent and useful discussion of the Reagan Administration and its foreign policy walk right past this one 
 The only reason I finished this book was to find out how Abbie wound up incased in ice. I found the characters and the plot annoingly predictable. The wimpy dissatisfied husband who runs off because he just isn't satisfied with the Mrs, the stoner, hormone possessed son who transforms into the hero/clean-cut law school student, Ty the lovesick puppy dog who never gives up on his "true love" even after she landed him in prison and destroyed his family only to cap it off by returning to him pregnant by the man that was responsible for the pain and suffering which he and his parents endured. Lest we neglect Abbie--- the spoiled rich girl who wreaks havoc in the lives of all around her. After years of anti-social behavior she is changed after being slapped around and sexually assaulted by her baby's father---- yes, suddenly she decides to turn herself in for the sake of the baby. Please! I was very disappointed. There was potential for an interesting story but the impression I was left with was that the author couldn't be bothered with the effort required to create it 
 I bought this gizmo to watch and listen to streaming audio video direct from the internet. I listen/watch a large number of programs on internet radio stations, international TV news and from the US network TV websites. The PR says that you can listen to all formats and cannect up to the web with OPERA. They do not tell you that OPERA on Archos can not do the simple function of streaming.  What kind of WIFI Media Player can not direct stream from the web? Archos! Even Palm can stream and it is not a Media Player.  You are going to spend over $500 before you are done and tech support is either nonexistant or not helpful.  Save you money an double check that it can do what you want it to do before buyin 
 no friends this is not the wonderfull music man you may have heard on the previous cast albums or in the film. While there are some wonderfull things on this album that make it worth the purchase such as the dance music on several numbers, The Pick-A-Little reprise, and a few others. But when it coems down to it the album is inferior to the orginal. Im not referring to the gentelman who portrays Harold Hill or the lady who portrays Marian as they are both marvelous. But everything else lacks the smooth flow of the orginals. Forget the revival and get the original 
 I have the "Journey of Dreams" CD by Ladysmith Black Mambazo.  It is delightful, swirling, singing music by a group of men from Africa.  I liked it so much that I bought another CD "by" the same group called the "Gift of the Tortise.  A Musical Journey Through Southern Africa".  Most of it consists of a lady talking- not singing- about the animals, places, and people of Africa.  In a couple of places ordinary children are heard singing in the screechy, ordinary way children sing.  Every ten minutes or so, a muted male voice sings briefly in the background.  There seems to be a big difference between what the producers of this CD consider artistic freedom and what I consider a bait and switch rip off.  I threw the CD in the trash 
 I thought this book had a lot of potential, but turned out to be a long-winded lament of Scilingo. It lacked a comprehensive historical overview of Argentinian politics, which would have placed the Dirty War in its proper context. Not useful for first time readers to modern Argentinian politics. Its not even a story of Scilingo himself. I found it a  bit clums 
 I bought this book thinking it was another great chick lit, especially given Sarah Jessica Parkers review.  I rarley put a book down before finishing it, but this was so slow it was painful.  Don't bother! 
 I bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it, so I thought I might like the Alps chair too.  I was wrong. It's very light weight, but it's a lot longer than my other chairs, which made it more difficult to carry and transport.  The arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings, one of which broke the first time I used the chair.  The next day, three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points, throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless.  Save your money on this one 
 I really wanted to give Superman Volume 3 a full 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality control of the DVD release is poor, hence the 1 star rating.  The DVD set I purchased skipped at the Green Lantern episode.  The replacement I got also skipped at the same place.  In addition, the two-sided disc format with which all three DVD volumes have been released is a damage prone format.  Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but at this point I'm not sure if or when I'll try my chance at buying this set again.    The lack of quality control is too bad, because Volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series.  If you are fortunate enough to get a DVD set free of defects, then you are really in for a treat.  Bruce Timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to Superman as they did on Batman: The Animated Series.  Of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain Darkseid throughout the series.  It finally gets put front and center in several episodes of Volume 3, and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale.  I felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story, but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series 
 Now White Sox is World Series Champions again, it's time to bury the eight men forever from our memories 
 Mr. Koch's "Axe Prowess" makes him a dangerous man to any potential Guitarslinger out there and with his merciless and irreverent assault on various genres of music, he's got no worries about being forever "Radio-Free."  G.K. also has a unique sense of humour, which is almost a pre-requisite for anyone wanting to survive in the music business with their sanity intact.  The thing that bothered me with this CD was, that it was overkill in tongue-in-cheek, hence the lower rating.  I much prefer G.K.'s earlier recording, "The Grip," which contained better tunes and a good balance of humour and great playing 
 I used his book as an MBA student 15 or so years ago.  Now as an adjunct professor, I am using this newest edition in my undergraduate classes. Although my observation may be biased, the book is a bit too encyclopedic,  a bit superficial in coverage, and fails to excite the students.  I wish it  were more up-to-date 
 Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11."  Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption."  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.  If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel "Mission Accomplished. 
 I absolutely agree with this review: "You will NOT get your moneys worth..., February 26, 2006"  We bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours.  We have the sable color, which I see is not sold this year... but I digress.  We have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it.  My biggest complaint is the steering.  The front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we're not on a smooth surface, it feels like I am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they don't rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards.  I am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so I can get where I want to go.  Shopping is a joke with this stroller because I cannot get it to navigate the aisles easily.  The shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which, really, doesn't seem like the best way to keep a child's shoulders restrained.  It ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt.  This is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger, this got on my nerves.  The adult cup holder is a joke, so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid's cupholder out so it doesn't stay in any longer as well.  Oh, and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on.  SO FRUSTRATING!  Not a big deal, really, but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time.  I just remembered also, that the sides of the padding in the seat area, when I used this stroller with our Graco Snugride car seat,  would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely.  I would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm-rests of the seat area (the parts that say Aria) before I put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly.  If Peg Perego could fix the steering, I think I would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that I found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son 
 Title says it all.  I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series.  Forth book sort of dragged.  By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel.  Let's face it, life's too short.  If you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of "The Stand".  I'm afraid this doesn't do it.    Think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers?  Cheer 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I've read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.  I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.  This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.  There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.  Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.  The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.  The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.  Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.  I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I'm going to read them 
 I bought this charger 11 months ago.  It came with 4 Kodak 1850 mA NiMH batteries.  After a few months of light use, the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as 1850 mA batteries should.  If I use the batteries immediately after charging them, I can take about 20 pictures (while my 2000 mA NiMH batteries can do >60).  If I charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves, they won't be useful after only a week.  The charger is capable of charging both AA and AAA batteries.  But a few months ago, 1 spring for switching between AA and AAA stopped working properly.  This was after very light use.  I only charge AAA batteries once a month.  The market for NiMH batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago.  I would not buy this Kodak if I were to buy today 
 I'm very disappointed in this book, although some information IN it is valuable, it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover. It is an excellent Textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular  basis and find ideas for what you need. Although broken into sections, they  are not readily found or visible. One must search the information needed as  in a research assignment. The reproducibles are MAINLY for elementary  grades. This was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it's  contents, on-line. Although the price was reasonable, I'm not pleased with  the way the book is organized & printed 
 I loved "on Mexican time" and visited San Miguel partly because of the book. I find it interesting that an american writer who was lucky enough to move there before the flood of expats has the cajones to complain about the current state of "his"town. After all, isn't he partly responsible for the popularity of the town 
 If you can ignore the dated assertions that the Earth is shaped like a top, you still have to swallow 1000+ pages of Fort's inane philosophical musings on subjects that have potential. Rather than explore in detail a specific time when, say, it rained fish, Fort is content to give the reader a list of all such events that occurred and use this as a springboard to prove (or prove-unprove as he would say) that there are magical lands in the sky 
 This book was assigned as a college reading assignment for an American Literature course, so I knew right off that I wasn't in for a real literary treat.  The criteria for a reading assignment are: a main character must suffer and then die, and language and plot must work to confuse the reader.  If you're looking for an entertaining read, do not choose this novel.  If, however, you are looking to read something for the sole purpose of telling others that you have read it, and wish to brag at dinner parties and other things of that nature, this is probably the book for you.  Personally, I like to believe that I have better things to do than read something that is depressing, boring, and poorly written 
 Artisan has released a horrible recording of a very good, sophisticated comedy that questions the values of marriage.  The DVD I got from the start had poor sound quality, faded color and was actually out of focus.  To add to this this disc started skipping, freezing and even getting the vocals out of sequence with the picture.  Don't waste your money on this release.  Wait for a better release 
 For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie 
 I was unable to get it to sync up with our computer and we have Windows 2000.  So it was no use to me 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 Livia Rokach so loathes Israel that she takes a good diary and twists it into a bad psuedo-history.  For instance, she cites to Prime Minister Sharret's diary entries regarding  the Lavon Affair and concocts, wholecloth, a conspiracy theory involving Ben Gurion, Dayan and Peres. No historian BUT Livia Rokach concurs.  The author goes one step further and blood libels Israel with the most horrendous of accusations, namely, that rogue Israeli Activists, intent on creating a wider war with Jordan, murdered eleven of their fellow Jews at Maaleh Akrabim in 1955 and pinned the blame on Jordan. How low can you go.  Again, no historian anywhere, (See Benny Morris, Israel's Border Wars) finds a shread of real evidence to support the author's wild-eyed slanderous lies.  Sacred Terror is pulp fiction in the guise of history. I'll pass 
 They SUCK! Bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established Chapelle humor. It was like watching Mind of Mencia. Two thumbs down, leave this one alone.   Tupac playing in the club was pretty funny though 
 Has everything:  a remarkable true story of a determined hero and the love of family in making his accomplishment even more special.  It makes you want to applaud his courage in many scenes, especially when he succeeds an incredibly painful test to stun his supervisory review board, winning their applaud as well.  This is a don't miss story told by tremendous acting throughout...20 star performances!  Thank you for sending me a copy.  -  
 this book is lousy its the worst. It promises alot but doesn't deliver.  If you want to learn to write meaningless every day conversation like:  "Hi how are you Sam?"  "I'm fine thanks George."  Then this book is for you. It never gets past the above formatt of dialogue and the narrative of this book is boring and hard to understand. The writer is a bafoon who admittedly carries a journal around recording conversations like the above "Hi sam..." The book is so annoying it make me want to scream.  
 When it comes to Anne Rice, I started not with Interview with the Vampire but with Servant of the Bones.  That one was okay, so I decided to read The Witching Hour.  What a freakin' mistake.  It's clear to me that Anne Rice, through her writing, is saying to her readers "Look at me! I'm so impressed with myself!"  (It's also clear given her recent 'review' on Amazon of one of her own novels.)  The story of the Witching Hour actually started off somewhat decently.  I was able to turn my head the other way during the poorly written sex scenes--scenes that were very similar to a scene in Servant of the Bones--and the rushed, badly handled romance; but once the story turned into the Mayfield history, it began to fall apart.  This is unfortunate, given that this is the last third of the book or so.  The end of the book felt cobbled together, rushed and unfinished, even for a book that is part of a series.  I literally threw the book across the room when I finished, mad that I'd invested enough time to read a thousand-page book and be disappointed by the end.  Worst of all, though, is that the story seems to be more adolescent self-serving fantasy than anything I'd really want to read.  I've grown up since reading this book and I've moved on to better authors.  If you don't read Anne Rice, I'd advise skipping her altogether.  Once you get past the first few books of the Vampire Chronicles, you will outgrow her writing 
 DO NOT ORDER THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON.COM. I ordered it 6 weeks ago from them, and it has yet to ship. Even though it still says IN STOCK and SHIPS WITHIN 24 HOURS, this book has not been shipped to me yet. I recommend looking at www.bn.com, where they ship very quickly 
 What i mean by the title of my review is yes this movie is going to be funny its Monty Python! but there is also some parts where it just really gets out of hand in my mind. If you are new to Monty Python I would get the quest for the holy grail before this one. Also the Monty Python's Flying Circus is great too. It comes in a 16 DVD set so it will give you a lot of their old stuff. I really did not enjoy certain parts. But there is a few good moments.  
 This was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I really don't think I will attempt another one.  The Plain Truth was painfully long, boring and repetitive.  Every character was annoying and unbelievable - especially Ellie and Katie ( the main two). I kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of Hannah but it never came.  Just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in.  The beginning is the only part of the book I found interesting....It went downhill ( extremely slowly) after that.     
 I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas, by the end of February the screen had visible holes in it and drew blood.  The shaving took forever.  But for the price I expect it to last more than 2 months 
 I bought this for my son-in law for Christmas.  He wanted an adjustable cutting board.  This one looked nice and sturdy.  I am so embarrassed, the board is cracked and warped.  I felt horrible that this happened.  By February, or even before, it was a piece of crap. I know that I threw out my receipt because I thought it would last a very long time. I bought one made of bamboo w/o the adjustable wires for $10. at The Christmas Tree Store for my daughter.  It will last forever, it's beautiful 
 One of the things I have enjoyed about Ketchum's works is how readable they are and Victory at Yorktown is no exception. That being said,I did not enjoy this work as much as I did his previous works.  One reason might be that I read Decisive Day, The Winter Soldiers and Saratoga before I knew much about the Revolutionary war, and I have read a lot of other books since then.  I didn't really feel as though I learned anything new in Victory at Yorktown.  It gives a brief account of the campaign in the Carolinas and Arnold's treason before delving into Yorktown. The description of the battle, and the Naval engagements prior to,  seemed to lack any emotion or excitement.  The personal accounts he provides are really the same ones that every other book about the revolution gives.  This could be a good book for those reading about the later stages of the war for the first time, however those who are well read on the subject may want to skip it. 
 I found the book to be a waste of time, energy, ink, and trees. It is nothing more then common sense re-emphasized. It gives a little bit of understanding the basic personality types, but does not give one the ability to "speed read". It basically says stuff like 'if a person is shy and doesnt socialize well, they are an introvert', well duhhh. DO NOT waste your money on piece-o-crap book. It is useless 
 "The Last River - The Tragic Race for Shangri-la".......Tragic. Yes I'd agree that this book is tragic. Tragic that I bothered reading it.....tragic that I paid for it in order to read it.....tragic that Todd wasted his time writing it......tragic that I disliked it so much that I can be bothered writing a review. The warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket. "Advance praise for The Last River" it reads. In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it. It seems that Todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal. So much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it. This was my third Tsango experience. I do recommend the Outside documentary on the Lindgren expedition. "Hell or High Water" is not outstanding, but is worth a read, but on this book, my advise to Todd is please make this the Last River that you drag through the wringer 
 Worst excuse for a movie score ever.  It really does sound like it was made just for the Playstation or XBox Video game set.  Another greedy marketing ploy from Disney 
 this is not the eric clapton i know. when he does blues that is clapton. i wish he would do another blues like "from the cradle. 
  After reading bits and pieces of this book from Borders, I decided to order it online. Well, all I can say is that this book was not worth my time and money.    I'll be very honest with you. He does have useful information such as manuscript formatting when submitting it to a publisher, but that's as far as this book goes in terms of being informative.   The attitude of the writer was a definate turn off for me. At first I thought him amusing, but as I kept reading this book I couldn't help feeling that he was being very arrogant and egotistic. In fact, the whole book seems like an ego trip to me. Unlike a lot of writing guide books, Monteleone actually tells us that all writers should aspire to be on the New York Times Best Seller List. Now, throughout the years I have heard of lot of writers and novelists cautioning their creative writing classes   about the consequences of "writing for profit." If you make money on the way, that's great. But making money shouldn't be your biggest reason in writing novels or short stories. You should write because you enjoy it. This, I believe, rings true. Of course, everyone has different opinions about how and WHY he/she writes, but Monteleone keeps shoving the Best Seller's List down the reader's throat. He even has a whole chapter dedicated on    promoting and marketing your novel (such as radio shows, press release, websites, etc.), but barely touches on the subject of getting an agent. After devoting roughly 30 pages on how to sell your book, he makes a few jokes and remarks about literary agents  and then moves on to other topics without telling us where and how we can go about obtaining one. His message is clear: "Making profit should be the writer's ONLY goal."     Also, Monteleone is not shy about showing his disdain towards academics and people who dismiss the so-called "drugstore books" as low-end. He thinks they are cocky and therefore deserves no respect from him (who, by the way, wrote over 20 novels that are out of print). But as far as I am concerned, he is the one who is the arrogant one that belittles the readers of this "How to" book. He has a very strong "it's either my way or no way because other people are all stupid and don't know what they are talking about" idea going throug his book. He lists a bunch of writers who were "the crassest commerical writers of their time" -- Twain, Poe, Dickens, London, Hemingway, etc. But what about writers like Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce and Kafka who were not commercial writers? Monteleone seems to be certain that people will still read Stephen King and Danielle Steel 100 years later.    He also states that he hates people who call themselves "authors" and not "writers" because he finds them (people who prefer to be called "authors") cocky and pretentious. This is one of many examples of Monteleone's arrogance. Again we see the "anyone who does not conform to my rules are stupid and ignorant buffoons" attitude.    One of the absurd rules he strongly suggest that we enforce while writing is "writing three pages a day." I have read other books on creative writing, and although many professional novelists stress the importance of writing steadily everyday, Monteleone is the first one to say that we HAVE TO write three pages a day. His reason for this ridiculous rule? Simple. The faster you write, more books you can sell down the road. The issue of profit-driven writing surfaces again.     Overall, I felt like taking a shower after I read this book. It's more about how to crank out a mediocre novel once a year and  doing everything you can to sell it. Although a good portion of  the book is about writing itself, Monteleone's emphasis is on marketing rather than techniques or even writing a good, solid novel. I felt more discouraged than anything because of his black/white attitude towards writing.     Monteleone ends his guide to writing with "if you want to tell him how much you enjoyed this book, e-mail him at ~." Even that sounds cocky to me after reading this parade of "I'm so great" book. The whole books just sounds like a HUGE EGO TRIP, nothing more.    I found books by Nancy Kress much more helpful than this one.  "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing a Novel" is one of the worst investments I ever made.    
 It is best to invest a few more dollars and purchase a better item  Light and not providing the warmth expected from this price level.  Feels incomplet 
 I ordered this as a gift for my neice for Christmas.  It's June, and she has yet to get a copy.  I called them in March, and they verified they have her correct name and address in their computer.  I'll going to ask for a refund 
 There are good and bad points about this book.  Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good by a bit.  There are interesting factoids presented throughout the book, which periodically does illuminate some little-known aspects of the Allied bombing of Germany that in a sense culminated in Dresden.  But the book is a mish-mash.  Every now and again the author, in explaining topic A, mentions toic B, at which point we get a multi-page exegesis on Topic B.  Unfortunately, Topic B is often at best tangential, and at worst almost irrelevant, to the main subjects addressed in the book.  It's as if the author either wanted to add words and pages for the sake of increasing volume or to show off his knowledge regarding diverse subjects.  Not well edited. 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 I'm sure it's a good product for beginners, but I already had an older version of Quickbooks (from 1995) and the only way I could export/import the old data into a newer version of Quickbooks was with QB Pro.  Simple Start doesn't allow you to import data from older versions 
 Carlo Ginzburg, author of CLUES, MYTHS, AND THE HISTORICAL METHOD (1989), THE ENIGMA OF PIERO: PIERODELLA FRANCESCA-THE BAPTISM, THE AREZZO CYCLE, THE FLAGELLATION (1988), and THE NIGHT BATTLES: WITCHCRAFT AND AGRARIAN  CULTS IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES (1983), is professor of  history at the University of Bologna and the University of California, Los  Angeles.  In his work The Cheese and the Worms, Ginzburg relates the story  of a medieval miller of Friuli, Domenico Scandella, called Menocchio, who  is put on trial for heresy during the Italian Inquisition.  Ginzburg nicely  recreates the experience of a medieval trial-something monotonous,  seemingly endless, and without apparent utility-at least to moderns who  generally suffer from a culture infused with impatient pragmatism.  This  relentless prodding of the inquisitors for answers to their hairsplitting  questions, of Menocchio for meaning to his contemptible existence, and of  Ginzburg for threads of connection between the trial proceedings and  possible sources is laborious.  Contemporary readers, except for  specialists in cosmology, derivative theology, evolutionary anthropology,  and late medieval history, likely will have little tolerance for such  esoteric musings. 	As stated, Menocchio, an obscure miller who is  nevertheless important to his local village, is on trial by Inquisition  authorities for heresies which are numerous, fluid, and conflicting.   Ginzburg's main objective, however, is to get at the sources for  Menocchio's thinking, especially his bizarre cosmological view involving  cheese and worms that are born in the cheese.  Like a relentless detective,  Ginzburg takes the reader into excursions, asides, and digressions.  He  explores written sources such as the Bible in the vernacular, the Koran,  Sir John Mandeville's Travels, Dominican Albert da Castello's Il Lucidario  della Madonna, and many others.  He postulates an eclectic medieval oral  tradition from which Menocchio might have gleaned his ideas.  But all this  chasing of sources makes the reader feel like the proverbial rat trapped in  the maze.  There are many variations of possibilities for escape, but there  is no resolve.  The discussion of  oral versus written sources goes on and  on.  Yet one thing is certain.  All oral tradition unless codified is  unpredictable and not easily discernable.  While a valid hypothesis  concerning source material for Menocchio's religious ideas, oral tradition  remains unverifiable.  After all, the written codification of the oral  tradition of Menocchio's trials is what Ginzburg found in the Archivio  della Curia Arcivescovile of Udine, and this discovery sparked his writing  The Cheese and the Worms.  Furthermore, Menocchio's suggestion that he is a  tabula rasa who simply creates these things in his own mind seems  incredulous.  That Ginzburg would take this seriously is all the more  unbelievable.  Menocchio is not unaffected by his environment which  includes written sources, as Ginzburg so ably points out. 	With the  question of the origin of Menocchio's ideas about origins aside, what is  left to discuss?  A Religionsgeschichtlich approach falls quick prey to  quaint anthropological inquiries.  This is what Ginzburg offers and little  more.  Perhaps more development of the Church hierarchy and the  consternation of the peasant against his elite accusers by way of a  sociological reading of religion in sixteenth century Italy would prove  useful.  But Ginzburg does little to develop this.  His real concern is  prodding the interaction of inquisitor, miller, and Menocchio's  acquaintances in order to find out about "Cheese."  When this is  attributed to an ancient Indian myth in the Vedas, derived from residual  medieval oral tradition, Ginzburg's work is done.   No more is left to  ascertain from Menocchio.  There is no complete characterization of  Menocchio-his family, his work, his accomplishments as mayor, his business  dealings.  These things are not explored, but these are what would make  Menocchio come alive and would give contextual meaning to his religious  ideas.  Why Ginzburg does not broaden his research is unclear, but the  failure to do so leaves Menocchio as a religious oddity, a heretic without  significance, another faceless victim of an oppressive religious hierarchy.   Perhaps Ginzburg is unable to draw a more complete likeness of Menocchio  from the trial proceedings. 	Although the specialist might prefer to  study the complete text of these trials, as exegete of Menocchio's  hearings, Ginzburg is superb.  As phenomenologist on this Friulian miller's  religious thought, Ginzburg is without peer.  But THE CHEESE AND THE WORMS  can hardly be dubbed a serious Quellenforschung or traditionsgeschichte  except for a very narrow slice of sixteenth century Italian history.   Michael Hunter notes, "Few will be able to accept Ginzburg's general  thesis, his argument that Menocchio gives expression to a lively and  homogeneous peasant culture" (HISTORY 1981 66:296).  Further, Bennett  Hill suggests, "The general reader will find the style opaque and the  results unexciting.  [The book is] for research libraries" (LIBRARY  JOURNAL 1980 105:1512).  At best, Menocchio provides an illustration of  "the ingenuity and determination of the human spirit in face of  adverse circumstance" (see J. H. Elliott, THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS  1980 27:38).  At worst, Menocchio is just another heretic that follows a  typical pattern with nothing exceptional, so Ginzburg (p. 112).  To adapt  an old cliche, when you've seen one heretic, you've seen them all 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 I've bought a number of Oxo kitchen accessories, and found them to be sturdy, remarkably well designed, and easy to use.  Unfortunately, this timer is an exception.  It has the usual features typical of timers at this price point: clock plus timer, ten number keys for input, memory, etc. But instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers, it's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer. It's solid-feeling and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom.  The problem is the display. It's horrible. For three reasons:  First, the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer I've seen. They're about 1/4" high, half or less the size of those on comparable timers.  Second, the numbers are recessed 1/8" or more beneath a clear plastic cover, not on the surface -- it's dark in there and feels like looking down a well. It desperately needs a backlight, but there is none. Unless the light source is shining directly into the display, there's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers. But that causes the third problem:  The clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective, and it's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn't a reflection shining back into your eyes .  The bottom line is that I have to fiddle around to get the timer, the light source, and myself into a position where I can read the small, dark, shadowed, and reflective display. Not what I need when I'm trying to cook.  It's just not worth it. Since I have several other timers with displays I don't have to strain to read, I use this one as a paperweight. I'd have to say it works very well.  I just don't understand how Oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door 
 Can't believe the author of the excellent Dr. Rhea novels wrote this! Unlikely premise (paranormal abilities), not particularly likeable or believable charcters, too much gratuitous violence....very disappointed.   
 Advertisement for this book is misleading. I thought it was the actual book, however its merely a workbook full of vocabulary. Not helpful at all!!! Save your money, you will still need the real book anyway! 
 Any true Softs fan would have to admit that once Elton Dean left and the guitar replaced the sax and Mike Ratledge's keyboard took a back seat they lost it big time. 'Bundles' was a poorly recorded effort more like a Alan Holdsworth solo album and 'softs' though much better didn't utilise Alan Wakeman's sax work enough. This is a reasonable recording when ex-Daryl Way's wolf guitarist John Etheridge took over and even i, who love the odd lengthy guitar solo found after a while it got on my nerves. It's like a guitar solo from start to finish (apart from a rather tedious drum solo) Mike Ratledge does one excellant organ solo and might as well not be there the rest of the time. Each song pretty much is an excuse for another guitar workout and as fine as Etheridge his 'look how fast i am' gets rather repetitive. The jazz rock excursions (this certainly isn't jazz) have the spirit of the Mahavisuna orchestra throughout without Jerry Goodman's violin to balance things out. Karl Jenkins composes just about everything and if you like his stuff fine, but i find it all rather one dimensional reliant to much on 'mood'. This isn't bad, but it is hardly essential 
 This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales 
   I had to work with a pc and windows because of my profession......architect..  My firms have always used architectural desktop.  Unfortunately, it only is compatible with a pc.  NOW  !!  finally I purchased an exquisite iMac.. and when need be, I can run architectural desktop on it in windows to get a few things done..    Apple vs PC ? No comparison.... and my iMac is so sexy it makes me smile.. so kill me.   
 Interesting book, but more often than not the paragraph descriptions on relationships are pessimistic.  With an understanding that relationships are complex it would have been good to balance the summaries with the possible positive aspects should a relationship succeed. Theoretically more muddled than the previous books.   Not very uplifting but interesting.  Good conversation book 
 Gaines should be put in the same category as Taliban. I grew up in Bergenfield, did lines with the Buress sisters', Olton, and Rizzo at Garvey's house. Yes, alot of children back then did waste time just as I did. But don't think that Gaines few moments in Bergenfield could sum it all up. Gaines knew nothing but to be a glory stealer for a book that was going to happen anyway. How about the other suicides, Like Paul Murphy and Chris Hurt. You should have done your math Gaines. Cooper's Pond had finger digits from snapping turtles that were restless. Gaines had nothing in mind but selfishness intentions. I'd like to meet Gaines and do a reminder. A product of the Teenage Wasteland she has described makes me think..I got a B.S of Science in M.E. a few years ago and I've been serving in the military as well. Ms. Gaines should remember me if we ever cross paths. Bergenfield was a town at that time that was showing the future. Ms. Gaines didn't see that, she just wrote a book....Words, they are so eas 
 When museum curator Bill Fanshawe vanishes just days before he is supposed to marry her best friend, Dorothy Martin swings into action. It's too late for Bill, and almost too late for his assistant--who is attacked in the museum. Dorothy decides the attack must relate to Bill's World War II service in the Royal Air Force. World War II veterans are a dying group, but Dorothy and her friend Jane are able to track down a few survivors. Still, what possible memories from a war more than sixty years in that past could justify assault--or even murder.   Dorothy discovers that sixty years matters relatively little to the English--who are still taking sides from the English Civil War of the 1600s. Those connected with Bill's air unit have strong memories--and continued anger over their losses and the way the war was fought.   Author Jeanne M. Dams's aging protagonist worries about her own health and future as she sees the decline in the WWII generation. Despite this, Dorothy is hard to really like--or identify with. Her leaps to conclusion--that Bill's death must have something to do with the war (because he hadn't done anything in the sixty years since?), yet her failure to really get at the recently donated items is hard to understand. Because Dorothy had relatively few stakes in the outcome of the investigation, reader interest is also reduced.   WINTER OF DISCONTENT is easy to read and engaging enough to be hard to put down. The 'American in England' approach lets American readers see England through American eyes--allowing the author to comment on aspects of society and history that an English protagonist would simply take for granted. I wish, though, that Dorothy could have been a bit more clever, endangered, or active--increasing my interest in the plot 
 To me, this game was seriously disappointing. So disappointing, I didn't finish the second case before setting it down forever.   I was highly entertained - at first. It's cute, funny, and going around clicking on things for a new DS user was highly entertaining. However, it quickly got older.   1. You can't skip through the horrendously long dialog - ever. Even after you've heard it about a million times because you're clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do.  2. I found myself looking for an internet walk through, yes, on this simplistic game. I couldn't figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you've read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level.  3. Possible Spolier - There seemed to be a glich in the second story in which I talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then I could never get a ticket into the planetarium. After that, I just couldn't take it any more and gave up.  4. The places and people never change. For each case, from my understanding, it's all the exact same tiny few places. I'm not a big gamer, but I like a world bigger than three feet.   I let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me.   Just to help this review - I'm a college-age female and this is my first gaming console, although I've played the PS2 quite a bit. Maybe it's really a hit or miss but I don't really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level. A REALLY high patience level 
 Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, "Enderverse".  I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.  I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.  It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics.  Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years.  I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics 
 This "book" was put together in a beautiful, trendy package but the recipes were few and not of much inspiration for steaming. It's title is clearly deceptive...The food may be healthy but they're impractical and some were expensive to assemble. They were almost better off to be served as gourmet, finger-food type appetizers rather than part of the main course 
 This book starts out with 120 pages of fluff C - mediocre at best and NOT why I bought the book.  Then it discusses briefly what microcontrollers are - seemed more like a bunch of scattered notes on the topic thrown together - again NOT why I bought the book.  Then it dives into Motorola chips and spends many pages talking about them - NOT why I bought this book.  Then the author uses really useless examples like sort routines (like that happens in microcontrollers a lot - better examples would have helped here) to illustrate whatever it was he was trying to illustrate.    Over all the book had the feel that the author tossed a bunch of lecture notes together, some poor cut and paste C examples in the beginning and then just simply got lost in his mission to show us how to program microcontrollers in C.  The reason I bought this book was to learn what I could and could not do with C.  I wanted to find out where C ended and assembly code "had" to take over.  I wanted good in-line programming techniques, addressing schemes, code techniques, the best ways to implement monitors, slick ways to manipulate registers.. This book was about Motorola chips and some strange examples of how to program them.  The book should NOT be called Programming Microcontrollers in C - maybe something like, Some Touchy Feely Intro To C and Motorola Chips With Sort Functions 
 This dictionary is just another long-winded, pretentious, unreadable, high-brow attempt to legitimize anthropology. The authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology. If you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class, and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions, forget this book 
 This book along with the book by George Butler is so full of crap and hype about Kerry that it makes me laugh. Should be listed as fiction and would make for a great novel. Everybody who really knows Kerry laughs whenever mention of this book is brought up.  Those who knew Kerry back in 1966-67 knew how much he wanted to prevent being drafted and stay out of the service. Kerry claiming to be a war hero is like Michael Moore claiming to be an athlete. Give me a break! 
 So unmemorable I'm not even sure I read it. Books about damaged college professors have begun to blur for me. Please, can these supposed writers of fiction just stop writing about the faculty of small liberal arts colleges? I can't remember what happened in which. There was a coed involved. And some drugs, I think. Or maybe that was The Corrections 
 These dried cherries are more like candy than dried fruit.  I was expecting a chewy, tart treat and got an instant sugar high instead.  I will use the rest of the cherries in salads or on cereal, but I won't buy them again 
 This is the third in an expanding series set in a cod-Celtic world focussed on the "kingdom" of Deverry.  I was impressed enough by the first to buy the whole opening quartet, and was sadly disappointed.  Books 1 and 2 are advertised as re-written, and are reasonably polished.  The unrevised 3rd and 4th books have a first draft quality and increasing reliance on dialogue, long stretches that read like film-script, which isn't well-written and expose the poor quality of the character writing.  Book 1 dealt with some adult themes, principally incest, but in book 3 the heroine Jill is just gratuitously and tastelessly sexually abused.  The main gimmick of the series is that the main characters are linked by destiny through reincarnation, and it records their "reunions" at different points in history.  In the first book the stories run parallel and reflect on each other.  As the series runs on the link between eras is weaker and the switch between stories is awkward and arbitrary.  In the later volumes, in an attempt to open the story into an eternal battle between good and evil, the author crow-bars in opposing schools of "Light" and "Dark" magic, obviously "inspired" by The Force from Star Wars.  Her magicians also travel and fight on an "astral plane" extraordinarily similar to the world of Marvel comics hero Dr Strange.  In the final analysis these are teen romances, with very few original ideas, populated by lacklustre characters, adequately written but operating on the law of diminishing returns.  I bought them so I had to read them.  Don't be sucked in 
 I bought this book soon after the death of my 11 year old daughter. I found the approach very uncomfortable and it left me feeling as though i was failing because i was not following the prescribed way of grieving. The examples given in the book led me to belive that if i did not follow the advice of the author i would be doomed to a life of sadness and despair. The most damaging aspect of the text was the insistance in "letting go", and idea i still find very difficult to accept. The freightening examples of people who had become overly interseted in the cause of a loved one's death only to fall victim to the sane illness would have been better placed in horror fiction. Stear clear, this book will help know one except the author 
 This book started really strong and started dying about half way through.  The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable.  About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused.  At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking "What?" Started strong, ended badly.  Too bad too, I really liked Booger 
 Do not buy this camera, I repeat do not buy this camera! Just read the reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. Lucky I got this piece of junk for Christmas, so I didn't spend a dime on it. I opened the package BEFORE reading any reviews. Now I wish I've read the reviews before opening the box. I don't care what setting you use, I tried them all and I have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera. The lighting sucks, you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones. I really wanted this camera to work, it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures. 
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
 What is the point of making a Tracy and Hepburn collection without including "guess who is coming to dinner?". This collection has only 1 "ownable" movie; Adam's rib. The rest 2, you can watch once, feel good and forget. But to not include their best movie together (and perhaps one of the most underappreciated gem of all time) is simply infuriating.  Do not fall for the cheap tricks of so-called collections. They will mix one good movie with two passable ones. Instead, buy "Adam's Rib" and "Guess Who is Coming to Dinner" separately and save your hard earned money.  
 Excellent , how to technical reference, easy to read and understand, a must have book for those interested in biodiesel, and / or waste vegetable oil 
 Yea I agree, these are the artists that give hiphop a bad name, if you could even call these guys artists. This album is strictly made for clubs, and for BET and MTV watchers and mainstream listeners. This is radio music, and stuff you would hear in the clubs. Thats all this music is good for. It has no creativity. The production on this album isnt bad, but lyrics, come on, you cant call these lyrics. I suggest you pass this album up unless your a mainstream listener. No top 5 for this album 
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 You've probably heard better singing at your local bar....late at night when everyone's had a little too much to drink.  Save your money 
 Midnight Syndicate wants to be a lot, I guess. It wants to be dark and scary, but they're more like a graphic vampie novel, you can admire the technique but you don't really get involved. The images they produce remain a bit plastic, static, with an overdose of well-known themes.   Twenty one short tracks, too short really, are offered here, with a not-all-to-believable-and-scary voice talking: "Born of the night, they lurk in the shadows...Gargoyles of living stone, lost souls who wander mist shrouded cemetaries, and vampires who dwell deep within forbidden crypts... Creatures of the night, they arise as darkness descends..." Can lines about things that hide in the dark be even more cheesy?   Then some strings are touched like guiter wires and this sounds rather good. A heavy churchbell starts humming, dark but single layered ambient creeps in. But  it's all still too obvious, and more and more I get the feeling this is some sort of "starters kit for Gothic fans".   You want effective, deeply seeded dark ambient that really knocks the light out of you, try "Within the depths of silence & phormations" by Raison d'Etre or any of  Lustmord's solo albums "Heresy" or "The place where the black stars hang". But of course, giants in the dark ambient world like Lustmord or Raison d'Etre don't really mess with vampires and Gargoyles and bombastic electronic sounding choirpulp. And because of this, there will still be an audience for an act like Midnight Syndicate.  I just hope that M.S. will evolve more, make less tracks, and the ones they do make, should be stretched out more, giving them a chance to get more layered and filled with more depth than they are now.  Track three, the title track, offers a truely menacing piano tune, but because the composers don't seem to know what to do with it, they just keep on repeating it. And after a short three minutes the track is over. And "corny humming number four" starts. So what? 
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 The title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. It's a grade-C howler but not as blatantly funny as I was hoping. Directed by exploitation film specialist Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the Philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. Playing hooker and small-time drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely Patty Hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. Run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as Lee and Karen are pitted against each other. Of course, they escape but shackled together a la "The Defiant Ones" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.  Meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for Lee who stole $40K from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). Needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of Filipino women, a dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. Sadly, Grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde whom I am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. Since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra 
 This is my first electric shaver. I have pretty rough skin and i get a lot of ingrown hairs. I'm a dark hispanic male and the shaver isn't doing much for me. It isn't as clean of a shave as a regular blade. It does leave your skin smooth but it doesn't cut very deep as to remove all the hair. It has a great desisn and very easy to work with and to travel with but the cut is just not the greatest 
 I was a little dissappointed.  This is a funny book, and these are obviously funny guys.  The live show must be outrageous...but then, the live show probably has props.   That's what this book needs.    It's a lot of words....  a lot of funny words, but all crammed in together with no real break.   After about 30 pages, you start to anticipate how each subject will be addressed.  Kind of like this review, after the first part, you know what the rest will be like.  Imagine how much more interesting it would be if Amazon would let me illustrate my review....   imagine what a great book this would have been if they had chosen to use some ILLUSTRATIONS!!!  (If the cover say's "Funny book" when you see it... look at the cover again, and imagine it with just the words and no pictures.. that's the book.  p.s. Yes I often enjoy books without pictures.... but this wasn't one of them 
 Electric Light Orchestra's third album, the suitably titled 'On The Third Day', marked a significant step forward for the band. Following Roy Wood's departure, co-frontman Jeff Lynne took the reigns and began to steer ELO's output towards the sort of material that would become staples of mid to late 70's FM radio. The results are mixed and there is more of a discrepancy between the high and low points on this record than elsewhere in their catalogue, but it remains a decent effort from a band still very much finding its own musical identity.  The Beatles (or hypothetical post-Beatles Beatles...) comparisons are seemingly always levelled at Lynne, a self-confessed fan of Britain's greatest musical export of the sixties. Here they are somewhat justified with Jeff's voice resembling John Lennon's at times and a handful of cuts resembling the sort of melodies crafted by Lennon and McCartney, particularly on 'Bluebird Is Dead'. This was probably not a conscious effort on the part of Lynne, although there is no doubt that with 'On The Third Day' he did consciously emphasise the rock elements of the band. As such this album is more accessible than its two predecessors and provides a couple of songs which, '10538 Overture' aside, have become the earliest canonised ELO tunes. 'Ma-Ma-Ma Belle' remains the band's greatest rocker thanks to Jeff's rough and ready vocal whilst the album's obvious highlight 'Showdown' pre-empts the more rhythmic hits the band would enjoy a few years later. The classical roots aren't disavowed completely (as evidenced by the delightfully overblown cover of 'In The Hall Of The Mountain King') but they have clearly taken a backseat to Lynne's broader vision. Even on the opening track the dramatic and heavily orchestrated instrumental 'Ocean Breakup' gives way to a reasonably pedestrian song entitled 'King Of The Universe'. 'Ocean Breakup' returns as a reprise a few tracks later but is cut short again, so it's obvious to see where the band's priorities now lay.  As expected, the new remastered edition is a beauty with bonus tracks for your dollar and the trademark of frustratingly short liner notes from Jeff Lynne. The man himself calls 'On The Third Day' an 'obscure' album; elsewhere, an ELO historian claims it was a concept album of sorts. This seems to be stretching the truth a little - 'Eldorado' or 'Time' this is not - but for old fans seeking nostalgia or new converts wanting to explore the artistry of ELO further this is worth a look-in. The band doesn't hit their stride until its follow-up 'Eldorado' but 'On The Third Day' is a more satisfying listen than either of their first two albums 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 My husband purchased this charger for me for Christmas, after lots of mornings when my van wouldn't start and he was already gone to work.  Except for having to search far and wide for the right kind of extention cord to plug this thing in, we were excited to have something for those "just in case" moments.  We plugged it in and have left it in since then.  Just this week our battery was dead again.  We excitedly went to use this charger, and lo and behold, it wouldn't work.  We had to call a neighbor to come and give us a jump start.  Later that day the battery was dead again (!!!) and this charger worked that time, so who knows what happened?  We haven't tried the outlet power, so I have no idea how reliable that is.  I won't count on this machine.  Luckily I have a small battery charger that I can plug my car into, and after twenty minutes or so I'm ready to go.  I won't be getting rid of that charger--it's much more dependable 
 I was expected a study guide geared for a university level, not elementary/highschool 
 This is the worst thing I have ever bought. I bought it because I am having some trouble in spanish in school. I bought it thinking that if I gave a english word it would give you the spanish word or vise versa. But all it does is give you the definition and does not give you the english word.So save your self 20 dollars and don't buy thi 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 I recieved this item yesterday.  Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the "Aluminum" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done.  Sincerly Ro 
 I found the book to be a slow read primarily because the use of the English language is so different. 
 Now that Hannity has gone on the record as a pedofilia apologist and defender of child molestation.   "Thank God for Hannity!" -Lee Krock, founder of NAMBL 
 This CD is totally boring, even when "Penny Lane" comes along to "pick things up", 'cause by the time "Penny Lane" comes along, I'm already so down and out b/c of how boring the previous tracks are, "Penny Lane" just isn't much; I like music from all decades and the '60's is no exception.  But what the heck is so great about this CD?  Nothing 
 The fantasy story in this book is delightful, as are the illustrations.  However, the book repeatedly shows a baby riding on a dog. There is no way I'm going to give the idea of riding a dog to my 2-year-old, especially because we have a dog in our household. This book would be better suited for older children who are able to recognize the difference between real and pretend 
 I can't recommend watching this movie. Maybe if you like the pain and have never seen some of the older movies that now famous stars have done. It's really no that entertaining, believe me 
 The book contains interesting facts and trivia about "Charlie's Angels", along with contributions from Farrah Fawcett and Cheryl Ladd. The highlight of Angelic Heaven are the personal photos of Farrah and Cheryl.  Other than some pictures, there's nothing new here. Additionally, the book has many grammatical errors, which become distracting after reading too many poorly written or incomplete sentences. For a more comprehensive and a better well-written book about "Charlie's Angels" (with a brief introduction bt Jaclyn Smith), buy The Charlie's Angels Casebook by David Hofstede 
 I, also, must second Mark Twain. This book is a waste of time! Why do teachers make us read it when we should be reading Tolkien, GK Chesterton, CS Lewis, and the like? Agh. Then, that could just be my wacky taste in novels...   But this was bad. Oh my gosh!!! The descriptions were ALWAYS needlessly long, the conversations ALWAYS needlessly long, the... blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what the whole thing was. Blah. The whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short 200 pg novel and it would have been a million times better! Maybe even good! And I like long books!   This book is terrible. Listen to the warning of a fellow voracious reader and do not waste your time! 
 Worked just fine for over a year, then started behaving very oddly. Among the various problems this TOB-30BC unit exhibited, the most dangerous was switching itself on even when the main control was set to off, not switching itself off at the end of a toasting cycle, sending alarms when switched off, not being able to switch the unit off!  This unit neds to be unplugged from the outlet and I consider it to be a fire hazard.  Repeated communications to Cuisinart remain unanswered. 
 It's really a fundamental book of communication especially on writing, even for a reader, English is not the native language. I can't see special focus on business.   
 K, besides the late arrival, the whole book was written in terminology in which I had to read over and over again before I understood the meaning. Its not like the book came with appendices right? Anyway, I do not know whats the huu haa about the book. It seems pretty fictional. Coming from a Muslim 
 An even though it's fiction, the incidents seem to fall out of the movies context to become contrived. Boring nonsence on a teen hormone kick 
 I truly feel sorry for Pynchon, knowing that writing this atrocity of a novel probably cost him many months of life.  By all means, if you want to read it, get it from the library as I strongly advise against laying out cold cash for this mockery.  Does anyone really care that a man's sexual episodes predict German V rockets falling on England?  Is it really important to World Literature that a man dreams he is being sucked down a toilet surrounded by crap and toilet paper and can even smell which race the crap came from?  The so-called Intellectuals who praise this claptrap are the same Great Thinkers that believe Ulysses by James Joyce is the best novel of all time.  I would rather read the worse writing of de Balzac than waste one more second perusing either of these novels.  Both these "novels" are truly "sound and fury .... signifying nothing."  
 This book was assigned to me for summer reading for Advance Placement Government class.  I got it through borders and paid high price for it, I highly suggest buying it used through amazon.com.  In the beginning this novel seemed very interesting with its unique insider perspective however this insider perspective drowned the novel with annoying anecdotes.  The perspective was lost with countless examples that were perfect cure for when I was in desperate need of sleep. The author states his views and makes his points in the first page of two of every chapter and for the next 10-20 pages it just filled with every moment of his 30+ year experience at D.C.  This novel is 700+ pages long and could very easily be trimmed down to under a 100 and still have a greater impact.  So I would advise to buy it used then just read the first page of every section 
 A Year and a Day is the typical, if not tired renditon of a coming of age teenage daugter and her coming of age brother dealing with the inexplicable suicide of their mother.  Said mother 'speaks' to the daughter, espousing superficial, mostly, irrevalent insight and Hallmark-isms that she seemingly was unable to produce when alive. The genuineness of the book would have been enhanced by deleting the deceased mothers verbage, which was trite and poorly developed, and  extremely sacchrine. I read to the end only to find out why the mother was in such despair and I was sorely disappointed 
 This book, is not for newcomers to statistics. It often assumes a well versed backround in probability and statistics (and I suppose a decent background in calculus). There is often little explanation for examples and theorems. Often the exercises and examples require the solution to previous exercises. This is extremely frustrating and often discouraging. Many times I would find myself being refered to an example in a previous or future chapter whose solution refers to a problem that needs to worked out. I have an undergraduate degree in math and am by no means a genius, but compared to many well written math texts, the clarity and conciseness leaves much to be desired. The exercises do not go from easier to more difficult but from difficult to difficult. Often the concept that is trying to be illustrated could be done in a much simpler problem.  That all said, the book is fairly well written given the aforementioned weaknesses. My professors seem to like it as do a couple of PhD students 
 You can eat when your hungry and stop when you are satisfied and still not lose weight if you are eating mostly the wrong kinds of foods.  It was only when I started eating right(lots of fruits and vegetables and whole grains)that I started losing weight!!!  I also found that when I started eating the fruits and vegetables that I didn't crave the bad things (candy and chips)so much.  
 This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics.  I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and  A. Isaicu all talke about these problems 
 This is a quick, easy read of a provocative and timely topic, considering that baby boomers are aging rapidly. It is unfortunate, however, that the reader does not get to know much about the author or her alleged psychic gift. This has the effect of creating somewhat of a credibility gap between the reader and the author, making what the author has to say not particularly believable. Perhaps, if the author had given more information about herself and her gift, the accounts that she gives would ring more true. This would have made the book more effective. As it stands, the book, although somewhat thought provoking at times, lacks depth, and fails to fully capture the reader 
 Although Widdowson is the editor of the Oxford Introductions to Language Studies series this book does not have the same feel as others in the series. The format is the same with a selection of readings following the author's introduction. However, this book seems to have been written as an introduction for experienced linguists. It contains all of the information but with none of the details that would make it a pleasant read for novices. Ultimately, trying to squeeze everything there is to be said about linguistics into 77 pages is an impossible task and makes for an unprofitable read.  That said, the selection of readings is particularly strong and Widdowson asks some pointed questions of each author. It is at times very apparent what answer he expects because he goes on to ask questions based on what his answer would be. This would annoy those who disagree with him.  This book only rated two stars because I expected more from the series editor. Widdowson seems to have missed the second word of the series title: introductions. Only those with a graduate level reading ability in the field of linguistics would find this book enjoyable. I would recommend Jean Aitchison's book instead (0340870834). It is highly readable and geared more for the novice 
 I love and admire sandy weill.i purchased this book to learn more about the man and his deal making prowess.although this book was well research,its presentation was what turned me off.i have never read a book so disjointed and dull.it doesnt follow the conventional chronological sequence that most biographies does but skips back and forth from one event to another i.e 60's-to-the-80's-to-the-70's-to 60's again...this goes on and on and on.this can be very very very frustrating.Also i dont think the authors did a good job in capturing the readers since the paragraphs come and go in that fasion throughout the entire book!  All who follow sandy weill's career knows his excellent ex-protege, jamie dimon.I would loved to learn more on Mr Dimon (curently President and COO of J.P Morgan Chase & Co) and i hope there will be a book on him in the future.  All in all, sandy weill is one hell of a guy who has done tremendous things in the financial sector.but if you really want to read a book which is more entertaining (or way better) than this book,then you should read "Tearing Down the Walls:How Sandy Weill fought his way to the top of the financial world...and then nearly lost it all" by Monica Langley.The book by monica langley is way way better and enjoyable.You'll also learn more about Jamie Dimon!!  In conclusion,dont buy this book but the one by Monica Langley.... 
 I love the Walk Away the Pounds series but this one has to be my list favorite.  It's hard to follow and it just seems sparatic to me 
 I was really excited to read this book when I bought it, but was pretty disappointed by the end.  First, it is not science fiction.  Second, although the characters are well drawn, the story is just not that interesting.  Finally, and the most important drawback, the ending really sucks.  There is no resolution, so you feel like why did I go to the trouble to read this if it doesn't go anywhere.  Overall, I finished the last page feeling very unsatisfied 
 I'm a student taking a color class at my local junior college and this is the required text. This book is the most awkward book I've ever read. The authors continually repeat themselves and ramble on about nonsense. The authors actually have the exact same sentences repeated within a chapter. This book is poorly written and poorly edited; there are misspellings, and incorrect information! While discussing complementary color schemes, the authors explain that complementary schemes involve colors directly opposite on the color wheel. Then they list the following examples "red-green", "blue-yellow", and "orange-violet". These exampes are INCORRECT. Blue and orange are complements, as are yellow and violet. If the author can't get such a simple statement correct, it seriously comprimises the rest of the text. In short, this book is simply the most awkward, frustrating book I've ever read. Please please please, spare your sanity and buy another book on color. 
 American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her 
 I wasn't very impressed with this book.  The games for infants suggested are very obvious, common sense ideas, like picking your baby up and flying her in airplane style.  I don't think anyone who has an imagination will  get much new out of this book.  Also, it gives you song lyrics without the  tunes/music, which isn't very helpful.  While there are some good ideas,  they are too few to make this book very worthwhile 
 Richard II is most likely Shakespeare's dullest and most obscured play.  Of course, this is only the perspective of a sixteen year old student.  It does seem however to be a common trend among many of the readers.  This was  just one of six required summer readings for my Advance Placement  Literature course, and let me just state that under no other circumstances  would I have read this book.  And to tell you the truth, I didn't read the  book.  I purchased the audio cassette from "Amazon.com."  After  completing the tape for a second time, and only understanding a few words,  I decided to get my hands on the book itself.  The only difference that I  could notice was my ability to distinguish who was saying what.  I do not  recommend this book to anyone without a Ph. D.  Even to all of you literary  geniuses, good luck!  You will certainly need it to stay awake.  I hope I  was able to deliver a delightful and ever so typical sixteen year old's  response 
 This is a very informative book and I will probably use it as a strong reference in years to come.  It is not, however, a very easily read textbook.  Some areas are repetative and make for very slow reading.  Many times the author backs up her explanations citing studies. This is excellent in a reference book, however, as an introduction to an area of OT, it makes learning the subject matter laborious 
 this is still cool but you only get 4 volumes not the full 7 i recmend if u realy want the complete colletion go to best buy and buy it for the $100 
 I know that Philip K. Dick is one of the great classic sci-fi writers, but this book seemed dreadful to me. At many points I had a difficult time figuring out just what was happening, and when I did , it seemed to be such pretentious rubbish. For example "I see now what Plotinus saw , he realized. But , more than that, I have rejoined the sundered realms within me; I have restored the Shekhina to En Sof". Another sample,  "The cosmic cycle will bring this age inevitably, it will be the next shemittah , very much like the first; the Torah will again rearrange itself out of its jumbled matrix." Some will find this very profound and delight in the obscure Hebrew references. For me, it was confusing , boring ,  and at times made me suspect the author was intoxicated.     More a poorly written religious fantasy than sci-fi , I must say this is one of the worst books I have read in some time 
 I gave this book a reading not too long ago. Nothing about this book is "controversial". It's the same manipulation of information that neo-nazis and the kkk use to put shame to folks of other races. Books like these have always existed, and their purpose is to make money from readers who think the message is "ground-breaking" or revealing of some deep knowledge that has always been hidden from the public. If you plan on picking up this book, be sure to pick up a confederate flag and a few skrewdriver albums to go with it, this book is equally brainless 
 Not a bad read, with some interesting twists to the plot. The character of Thrawn is well developed, but the story tends to drift through space somewhat. You'd want to think the jedi had enough backbone to oppose C'boath rather than just defer to him all the time.  I dont know why Zahn even bothered to bring Obi-Wan and Anakin into the story as they were forgotten in the midst of the plot.  Overall not a great story, but good enough to pass the time on a long distance trip. 
 After reading Bernstein's Capital Ideas, a cheerleading book for lognormal finance theory, which gushes over heroes, I had high expectations for Jacobs' criticism Bernstein's viewpoint. But Jacobs' sole argument  seems  to be that portfolio insurance was a bad idea, and he repeats it too often.  Many chapters are simply too repetitive and were written as if they'd been  cut and pasted from different badly-written review articles. Even though  the book is post-LTCM (post 10/98) most of the book is taken by with  attacking of LOR's pre-1987 idea of portfolio insurance, while the far more  fascinating and more recent case of LTCM and the near collapse of the  global finance system is hardly discussed. I recommend instead "The  Vandal's Crown" and "Inventing Money" 
 Plain and simple - you get what you pay for.  $40 for a tricycle = a dangerous tricycle.  Simply touching the handle bars on this trike, and the whole thing goes down!  I'm glad we tried it indoors and not on the concrete!!  We received it as a gift, and after the handle bar incident happened twice, I did some online research and found out how dangerous this trike is!  Invest a bit more money and get the Kettler - well made, sturdy, safe, worth the price!  Shame on you Radio Flyer 
 this movie was soooo boring and not only that put even the ending didn't put means to the movie what a waste of seeing hte movie or even renting it trash 
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
 This book does not have the quality that I am use to reading in her books.  If you want to read a really good one, read "The Harvestor" or "Freckles.&quot 
 I bought a GustBuster umbrella several months ago, expecting that it'd be the last umbrella I ever needed. Wow, was that a bad decision. This "windproof" umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind (the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour). So I e-mailed the company because I remembered that it had a "lifetime guarantee." They told me that I'd have to ship it back to them (which is perfectly fine), but I'd also have to pay them $10 for their trouble. What kind of lifetime guarantee is that? For $10 or less I could buy another umbrella locally. Their product has proven that it's NOT superior and it DOESN'T live up to the claims they make for it.  Don't spend all this extra money on a GustBuster because you think it'll work better. It won't. Go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a GustBuster -- you'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella, and you won't be paying an outrageous price for something that doesn't work the way their marketing claims 
 Founding concepts are really dated now as Bruner himself seays in the latest preface.  Useful for historic reasons but not for today's teaching needs. Amazon did an excellent job of delivery etc.  Should probably not recommend it to those who buy Wong for exampl 
 I expected a more from Mem after such classics as Koala Lou and Possum Magic but The Magic Hat is simply not magical. It reads like a rough draft of a good premise, a magic hat blows into town and whoever it lands on turns into an animal. The book is written in rhyme but the rhymes are too advanced for it's target audience (Kindergarten, 1st grade). The only way the children figure out what animal the person is going to turn into is by questioning and prompting. Anyway, this is a flimsy effort by Mem that ends in a muddled and confusing manner. Overall, this is one to avoid 
 Don't believe the hype.  This book is not a masterpiece, but if you are able to stick through the piles of metaphorical images that are at moments beautiful but most often don't quite make sense together and make it to the end of this novel you'll be pleased to find some actual action and true emotion in Justine.  It took me a very long time to read through the first half of this book.  The narrator is irritatingly affected and the writing drags with a myriad of descriptions that are uneffective at creating a cohesive picture.  But what kept me going were Durrell's secondary characters.  He has a nack for capturing and creating quirkiness that borders on bizarre and his stories of the more minor men and women in Justine are striking, emotional, and entertaining.  I am glad that I was able to make it to the end of the novel (there is a hospital scene that made it all worth while), but I do regret that I recommended this novel to my bookgroup and I do not plan to complete the quartet 
 Let me start by saying that I've got a high tolerance for boring. But this book is worse than boring. This book's been written by a woman who apparently lacks a basic understanding of the grammatical rules of the English language (let's not even get into the numerous spelling mistakes making appearances throughout the text). And it's been edited by a person who apparently has no qualms with allowing said poor grammar and spelling to see the light of day. On at least every page I've read so far there's been at least one glaring error. I have read over 100 pages of this atrocity (lucky me). These people need a good copyeditor.  In addition, they really need to work on sentence flow, because the text is full of sentences that appear to have no logical relationship to one another - and have been plopped down next to each other anyway.  I'm not going to claim I'm a genius at this stuff, but I'm not trying to write a $50 book. There may well be some good ideas here, but even a well-educated adult (maybe even ESPECIALLY a well-educated adult) is going to be able to get through this without being tremendously distracted by the poor quality of the writing. It makes me want to hurl that I spent money on this thing. I can't wait to be done using it so that I can sell it to some other poor unsuspecting soul - or some other poor grad student like me who won't have a choice about reading it.   If you're a professor, please show mercy on us all and leave this out of your syllabus. It's AWFUL 
 The Comendium contains introducing desciptions of Hunter's antagonists. It's not bad but definitely too little for an own book, even a compendium. It should rather be a chapter in a bigger publication. If you have knowledge about Vampire, Werewolf or Mage you don't need it 
 Too much talking!  I was disappointed that there was not much music played in the video 
 First of all let me clearly state that im from Atlanta and I am a diehard fan of Lil Scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this CD is garbage. Besides Money in the Bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with DJ Don Cannon early last year was on fire, He and Cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point, that was of course before 50's influence which brings us to our problem. The influence of Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent is very clear on this album. I like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south. If the G-Unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let Scrappy pick and choose his own tracks, verses etc. everything may have been fine. The guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the "A" is pumping this and it is a shame because when Scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable. This CD is garbage plain and simple and 50's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise's up. This is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.I have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he's dropped but, im telling you If you the consumer buy this Cd you will regret it and to Scrappy ditch the G Unit do what's in your heart and get back to business. 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 I gave this cookbook 2 stars because although it was exactly what I was looking for, it came in an unacceptable condition. My mother had the original book for as long as I can remember and it had become well worn. Pages were falling out of it. This book was for all intesive purposes the same. When I gave it to my mom for Christmas she was so excited. Unfortunately, the three ring binder on it was broken. This is very bad considering that you need them to turn the pages. I would say that considering it was brand new, this was unacceptabl 
 This book is scientifically applicable, but lacks certain validity concerning heat retention, and other various forms heat transfer. I would reccomend this book to anybody who is interested in thermodynamics, but a  profound interest it must be, because for most, it may seem a little dry. I  give it 2 stars, but I would have given it higher if it's theories had been  more precise. Mr. Siegel obviously knows his thermodynamics , though, and  it is a rather intriguing book, once you get into the more exciting thermal  theories. A good book, all in all, and I hope Mr.Siegel authors other books  that I may be able to obtain 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 Because this sounds like Glitter the soundtrack re-done by Beyonce! Or did she just pull a Glitter part II: B-Day. This dumb album should have been called MAY-DAY!!! Why does she have like 4 or 5 song out right now? I mean why? People are just in love with her looks not her music trust me, for this to be a hit album she must have gave some good h**d!! 
 I have been purchasing the Vanity Fair My Satin Fantasy bras for years and YEARS!!!!   BUT, I have become very very disappointed.  I just bought 4 and ordered the free ones on the special offer "buy 2, get one free".  Now I have 6 bras that are practicallly worn out after the first wearing!  The little laces wore through nearly all the way, the stay poked out on the first wearing.  I carefully hand wash them and hang to dry, no wringing.    I think the manufacturer is trying to save money by eliminating the little plastic caps on the ends of the stays.  I have a huge scratch where the stay ripped my skin.  The style changed and the quality as well.  I would like an explanation and would like money back!   I am so sad that a great product is now less than mediocre 
 This is the first Elliott Kalb book I've read and I'm extremely disappointed with the numerous errors that pepper this book throughout.  Younger readers who are trying to learn something about the greats of the game will be inundated with incorrect or contradicting information and readers who consider themselves somewhat educated about baseball history will soon become annoyed at the mistakes, which seem to adorn every single page.  Kalb states in one player's comments that the first All-Star game took place in 1934 (incorrect), then in another player's comments writes that the first All-Star game was played in 1933 (correct).  Confusing, no?  This is one of many examples that I found.    It appeared that some errors were the result of just plain laziness, while others came from poor research.  In the Mike Schmidt chapter, Kalb writes: "In 1977, he (Schmidt) scored 114 runs on his .274 batting average.  That's the record for most runs scored on a sub-.280 average in baseball history."  Not only is that NOT the record, it's not even close.  The record is held by Hub Collins, who scored 148 runs while hitting .278 in 1890.  In fact, there have been 73 times in baseball history that a batter scored at least 114 runs while hitting below .280.  And if you ignore the 19th century and only consider modern-day (1900-present) players, Red Rolfe holds the record with 143 runs scored on a .276 average in 1937.  The feat has been accomplished 36 times since 1900 and Schmidt is tied for 32nd (and last) place.  This may be nitpicking, but it's errors like this that make me not take this book seriously.  My second point of contention is that Kalb rarely "sells" his opinions why he thinks one player is better than another.  He states facts (sometimes even correctly), and compares the numbers and contributions of each man, then leaves most of the job to the reader to decide who was better.  But I bought the book hoping that "Mr. Stats" could convince me why one player should be considered better than another or perhaps change my mind about some of my own opinions.  Instead he came on with all the  conviction of a wet noodle.  I'm not going to bash Kalb for his rankings because, frankly, they're based on his opinions and he's entitled to them.  Just because I may disagree doesn't make him wrong and me right.  But his infatuation with Barry Bonds and insistance on bringing up his name every chance he could, became overbearing at times.  We get it, Mr. Kalb.  You think Barry Bonds is the greatest player of all time.  It's bad enough that I had to read about it  on the first page, let alone be constantly reminded of it on every other page.    As you can tell by now, I wasn't impressed with the book at all and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  It wasn't particularly well written and there are too many errors and inaccuracies to receive my endorsement.           
 I am almost done with this book....but reading it has not been the experience I had thought it would be.  I realize that this book is about her travels towards faith and that is a uniquely individual thing, but I am really struck by how self-involved the author is...her brand of Christianity seems solely to be how can God enhance her life and the life of those she loves.  It all revolves around how finding God has improved her life...with nothing about what God requires of her.  I don't consider myself Christian in the born again sense but I was certainly raised in a Christian manner...by parents who volunteered in a million different ways in order to serve God and those less fortunate.  Why doesn't Anne Lamott put down the pen and go work in a soup kitchen?  She definitely writes well and I enjoy her style, but she needs to get outside her head 
 Unless you are prepared to be constantly putting the ropes and the masts back on the ship, this toy is a complete waste of money. My son had been wanting the Black Pearl for quite some time and this was a huge disappointment to him.  Buyer beware 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 After waiting 3 years since Shutter Island for DL's next book, this collection of short stories and a play came as a major disappointment. Might DL have a writer's block problem? Some of the stories are quite good, except ICU, which is a failed attempt at being kafkaesque. But they don't add up to a book. DL should have written a few more for a more solid collection. The play is just plain bad. The scenes based on "Gwen" are so much weaker than the story. Filling it up with the triangle scenes and the doctor/patient scenes doesn't make it a real play. It is still just a collection of scenes. The dialogues are sometimes miserably juvenile, reminding me of high school efforts at drama. The father/son war of the Gwen-story does not bear being stretched anyway, the man's badness is so overdone, it ought to stay tucked away in a short story. I think the best of the stories is "Gone down to Corpus". That is also juvenile, but in the sense of looking at young people who are feeling hopeless. Convincing, and very "economical", as the cover blurb announces. Economical probably stands for very short. "Running out of Dog" is a very violent and very bloody, well constructed story about another hopeless situation: when hope comes late to a man, it is dangerous. That's the aphorism around which it is constructed. Some more like these, and I would have given more stars 
 This is at best a choppy book, written by various people on their perceptions of Asian business.  I think it does little to explain how Asian businesses actually operate -- some it is PR, some of it hype and some just  regurgitation from mewspapers, etc.  These are some of the same types of  people so picked on by the IMF now for failing to inform them how business  actually functioned in Asia!  The most telling evidence - although written  just prior to the onslaught of the Asian crisis, none of the  "experts" foresaw it or its effects on competitive business  operations in Asia.  It is even less useful now.  Marginal at best 
 The action isn't believable.  The technology is silly.  The heroines are paper thin.  Every character's behavior seems surreal and unbelievable.  Other than that a lot of people seem to like it.  Great to have undying fans I guess 
 This book was really quite disappointing.  The idea presented is quite simple (how to place landscaping for the greatest impact), but the illustrations and landscapes presented are very unusual.  Do you live in a desert?  They have a desert landscape in there, just in case you do.  Mountain views? Probably not!  Mountain stream running through?  Most of the yards in this book are extraordinary before someone even begins to put in bushes and flowers.  This is not a book for the average person with an average-to-smallish yard and a budget 
 By now (December 12, 2004) we've learned a few facts about self-promoting blowhard BERNARD KERIK. How marvelous that "The Lost Son" has already been optioned for development as a major motion picture - it has the potential to become the funniest biopic since "Mommie Dearest." I do hope the screenwriter will include a role for JENNIFER LOPEZ as the illegal domestic worker (J-Lo was great in "Maid in Manhattan") and wouldn't MARGARET CHO be wonderful as Bernie's abandoned Korean daughter 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 I couldn't get this cassette adapter to work in my car.  Upon investigation, I found that the tape reel sticks, and doesn't spin.  I opened the cassette adapter up (it's screwed together), and found that the gears do not line up very well.  Needless to say, I returned this cassette adapter to Amazon.  I was pleased to see that Amazon paid for return postage on this defective product.  I will be buying another cassette adapter from a local store (maybe Radio Shack), so that I can more easily return the item if it doesn't work.  It seems that a lot of these cassette adapters have flaws in them, and the more expensive models are not always better.  Good luck 
 The book I received appears a very cheap copy of the original book. There is no ISBN and copyright page, even the cover appears a cheap colour photocopy. What's the story?? You pay $20 for a book you expect to get a quality printed book. It mentions that it is published by Harper Collins though I am unable to find any reference to it on their website. I believe Amazon and/or the author owe buyers an explanation 
 I came across McCarry after reading Mark Steyn's claim that he was another real ex-spook novelist and better than LeCarre.  Well, lots of things are better than recent LeCarre, but at least to judge by this book McCarry is a journeyman writer who doesn't come close to comparing to LeCarre in his prime.    Yes, his intelligence background lends surface realism to his descriptions of a hunt from one end of the world to the other-- the part set in a remote corner of China where Kafka meets Genghis Khan is especially convincing and amusing.  But too much of this covers standard airport novel stuff-- the old (by now very old) Nazi in South America, the way-too-much-to-swallow-mystery (which covers all the ground from ancient Judea to Osama bin Laden-- by way of Heydrich's Czechoslovakia!), the band of retirees assembled to solve it all who fall somewhere between Doc Savage's Fantastic Five and one of those aging-actor-work-program movies like The Wild Geese.  The real point is that McCarry is telling a plot-- a whopper of one-- and can only tell it by sending his main character from one part of the world to the next where, conveniently, someone who we are told will tell him nothing promptly tells him everything.  LeCarre, on the other hand, uses the dilemmas of spying to explore character.  The mystery in Tinker, Tailor could hardly be smaller (one's a mole, which one is it?) yet it's vitally involving.  The mystery in Old Boys could hardly be bigger yet it's-- oh, that old thing again.  Whatever 
 The author writes in his Introduction "In this book the reader will find, I hope, an antidote for historical amnesia (xvi)."  To do so, Nash says that his book aims at "Disinterring these long-forgotten figures from history's cemeteries (xvii)," so the reader will encounter those figures the middle and lower ranks of American society ... [that] remain anonymous (xvii-xviii)."  But as much as it is touted as a "new" and "fresh" approach to the "untold" history of the American Revolution, I can only say that this is so much hype.    I was primed by Professor Nash's introductory claims to expect reading some new interpretation of well-known sources, or possibly some ground-breaking research into untapped primary source materials.  Instead, I quickly realized that while many of the narratives on eighteenth century America were interesting, there was little that was "new" or "innovative," except his assessment that his interpretation was somehow "radical."  In fact, I soon realized that I was familiar with most, if not all, of the people and events he described: so much for being "new."  A look at Nash's source citations will show he has actually done little or no actual "research."  Instead, he has produced an analysis of old narrative histories, many of which have been around for decades, as well as some more recently published secondary accounts.  Quotations, more often than not, are attributed to other historians, or if historical figures, are "quoted in" other secondary sources.  This is how good undergraduate research papers are constructed, but as a published work, it must be described as "analysis," and not a "contribution to the body of historical knowledge."  Furthermore, many of the older sources he quotes would otherwise be those of the sort he would criticize.    It reads as if it is written more for other academic historians, rather than to educate a reading public starving for historical narrative.  Nash injects "political correctness" into his analysis at the expense of really understanding the era.  For example, he never describe the Six Nations of Iroquois as an "Empire," as if only Europeans can be guilty of creating such polities; although they ceded Shawnee or Mingo land claimed by right of conquest to white settlers.  In another example, he implies that the captivity of white children and their adoption into Indian societies was somewhat kindly.  The murders of the rest of the captives' family or the sense of loss experienced by those surviving the raids are thus minimized.  That some of those who refused repatriation may have suffered from an eighteenth century version of "Stockholm Syndrome" is not explored; while those who escaped or accepted repatriation and related not so pleasant experiences in their captivity narratives are ignored or marginalized.  In Chapter 5, "The Dual Revolution," Nash indicates a lack of knowledge or understanding about the military history of the American War for Independence in general, and the war on the frontier in particular.  One clue is given in his description of the Wyoming Massacre of 1778, the "grisly story of Tory and Indian brutality," of which he concludes "Modern scholarship supports none of this (255)."  Yet, even the Tory commander Major John Butler's report, available in the Sir Frederick Haldimand Papers in the Canadian Archives and British Museum, recorded that the Tory rangers and their Indian allies "took 227 scalps and only five prisoners."     Overall, Nash's account just plainly gets a lot of it wrong!   
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 You'll need a complete background to understand this book.  There are few practice problems, the ideas are presented with little explanation or connection to traditional lower calculus 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 While I found the writing style good and the information interesting, the actual diet was unrealistic, too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable. I found myself longing for spices (how bad could pepper really be?) and questioning the validity of their restriction. I couldn't stand the ground-up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail - the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it (or what I imagine that to be).  I'm not writing this to disparage anyone from trying the diet - if you can handle the restrictions and you have the self-control required, you might find this diet doable and rewarding. I tried the Fat Flush with a group from work - inspired by one woman who is able to do the flush again and again every year (she always gains the weight back). The rest of us, while successful for varying degrees of short periods, found the diet unrealistic for any long-term results - all of us gained the weight back and spurred by instant weight loss, some even picked up worse habits than they began with.  The funny thing is I found much of the health information useful or interesting, but I got rid of the book b/c sitting on my shelf it reminded  me of unrealistic goals and failure - not what I want out of a get-healthy  plan.   I'm writing this review so that others don't get sucked in by all of the positive reviews hoping for lasting results - 3 of us didn't have any 
 The fact that Sowell is a black man criticizing other blacks doesn't make him any more right or less racist.   The fact that he perpetuates anti-Southern bigotry and invents a connection with ghetto culture and Southern culture doesn't seem to turn anybody off. What he fails to acknowledge is the true connection with criminal behavior and that is institutionalized urban poverty, not Southern culture.   FBI statistics prove this repeatedly.  I don't think Sowell really knows any rednecks.  I grew up in the South; most of my youth was spent in a very small town in a rural county where I was surrounded by rednecks.   I will grant you that they dislike intellectualism (which made me really unpopular) but they weren't any more violent than anywhere else, and in fact I'm often appalled by stories I've heard from friends' kids about the kinds of things that go on in schools now, and I don't live in North Carolina any more.   The rednecks I grew up around, the vast majority of them had very strong Christian faith, and they worked hard even if (usually especially if) they were poor - just like the vast majority of folks who are in the ghettos.  They dislike shows of money and are extremely thrifty to the point of being just plain cheap, which is a stereotypical Scottish/Irish value that Sowell conveniently ignores.  The other positive value we Southerners have retained that everyone else seems to have forgotten is basic manners.  After I left college and moved out of the South I was appalled at the general lack of basic consideration for other people, who didn't greet you on the street or even use "please" and "thank you."  Last, I challenge anyone to prove that Southerners are overall more violent than the rest of the nation, especially given per capita crime rates are much lower in rural areas and the South is mostly rural.  I'm disappointed that only two people seem to be approaching this book with a critical mind, out of over 60 reviewers, and I'm especially disappointed at all the people who continue to applaud    such bigotry.   How long has the Civil War been over?   Not one of you remember it but somehow you can't seem to get over it.  In short, Sowell's arguments would be great if they were all based on fact 
 They say that there is a thin line between genius and madness.   Unfortunately, it does not follow that if someone is on one side of the line that he / she will ever cross over to the other side.  This film is testimony to that.  I do not give this movie 1 star because I think it was poorly done.  For what it is, it's a very well-done film.   Ed Harris is fantastic as Pollock, and one can tell he had a passion for this particular part.   Val Kilmer barely has a cameo and Jennifer Connelly is only in maybe 10% of the movie {sigh}.  The reason I slam this movie is because I'm not impressed by this artist or his work.   I would have found a biographical movie on Ed Harris himself to be much more profound than this guy's story.  In my family there are two artists:  my father and sister.  The artistic gene skipped over me entirely as I can barely draw a stick man.  That said, I remain unconvinced that I can't do anything as well as this guy did.  Or, to put it another way, any kindergartner could have made random shapes like this guy & called it art.   When I think of art I think of Raphael, not this guy.  So, since I had such a low regard for Pollock's work, I could not help but have little interest in this movie.    To me he was nothing but a cop out.  That said, I'll be as fair as I can here:  if you happen to be a fan of Pollock's you're not going to find a better testimony of his life than this movie.   The problem is I'm simply not impressed by that 
 I had a very frustrating experience two times I tried to buy this book...each time I recieved book that had no illustrations or plates or diagrams that were listed in the contents...I had books with 174 pages when the book is supposed to have 300 pages...I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS ABOUT BUT I FINALLY CALLED BORDERS AND THEY HAVE THE BOOK WITH 300 PAGES WHICH I bought WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF 
 I am not too thrilled with this cookbook.  Many of the ingredients are not items that you would have readily available in your cabinets or refrigerator.  Also, it seems like the preparation and cooking of these recipes would definitely take more than 15 minutes 
 This is just a REALLY bad book.  First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor.  What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?    The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains.  Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable.  Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever.  Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains.  This is supposed to be one of those "the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).  I could go on and on but it's not worth the words.  This book is REALLY a waste of time.  I can't believe anybody published it 
 Google the words Foster Cline and Attachment Therapy, and be prepared to lose your lunch. Happy research 
 This popped up as a book that Amazon thought I'd be interested in.  I've been fooled by those reccommendations before, so I got it at the local library first.  It was a big letdown.  As other reviewers have written, there were no concrete techniques; no take-away's from this book.  There was a paragraph or so on "disappearing", but it primarily served as a teaser for another Paladin Press Book on hiding your idenity.  There was nothing on the design, selection or provisioning of the survival retreat (since "that information was covered in other books").    I read it in a couple of hours; many pages are little more than full page, stock-image photos.  I could have read it in even less time had I decided to skip over the screed about black helicopters, Waco, etc.  The title has potential to be a good book, but this fails in the execution 
 Not his best stuff. He's running short of lyrical ideas, he recycles his own lines, like Star Wars recycles "I have a bad feeling about this".  Beats are usually cool, I don't care for the popish tracks with the singing. I didn't mind it so much when he sang REALLY BAD back on his first album, but now it's no longer funny, it sounds like pop.  Anyhow, organized religion is crap. I thought KRS understood this back in the day. What happened? Now he's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy, and his only little diciples and crap, I dunno, it's posative, but then again it's gay like some of his modern tracks.  Anyhow it is cheap, if you have to finish off your collection as I do, then buy it, otherwise go buy his anything BoomBap on back. Or check out:  Kool Keith  El-P  Gang Starr  Mr. Lif  Jedi Miind Tricks  Public Enemy  Non Phixion  Sir Menelik  Most of which is better than KRS' latest works 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 This book is for couples who want to give each other a sensual massage. First of all, try giving a full body massage sitting next to someone on a bed, your back and shoulders will hurt. If Clare is so serious about massage, why doesn't she have them on a massage table, which is proper. This sounds like a book about foreplay, not massage. Someone with therapeutic intentions or who wants to get out knots or kinks will not benefit from this book. Some of the positions photographed are sexually suggestive. There may be technical discussion in this book, but it is out of place. The featured bodies may be beautiful, but not draped properly. This is not for professionals 
 I love dogs but if I had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training, including the different levels snd sub-levels, I would have bought a manual. I wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing. I got neither. The characters were neither likeable nor substantive. Except for the cop next door, I have no idea what they even look like or what, if anything, they care about besides dogs. The plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear. Maybe the series inmproves after this book. I'm not taking that chance 
 I received this machine as a birthday present.  The first night I tried it, the power and light would turn on and off at random intervals until I could not turn it back on.  I returned it to Target where I was given half of the machine's retail price because I did not have a receipt!  (Did I mention this was a gift?)  I purchased a Singer 8280 and I am very excited about it.  Don't waste your time or money on this machine, the frustration is not worth it 
 The story starts out with a lot of promise, which is why it's so disappointing when you get to the preposterously dopey ending. I won't give too much away, but the ending is like something out of a 1930's B-movie. There are so many ways this could have been done that would have been infinitely more plausible (for example, see Richard Morgan's handling of similar issues in a subplot of Broken Angels). I was literally angry as I got to end of the book because it was such a letdown--I was listening to the audiobook version in the car and was actually shouting at the CD player as the ending unfolded.  Hard to believe this is from the same author that gave us The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Unless you're *really* good at suspending disbelief, avoid this one 
 The book is 17 years out of date.  Donald writes, ""Broca's region" and "Wernicke's region" are convenient fictions, the truth being that aphasia can be caused by wide variety of legions that spare these areas, while occasionally the complete loss of these areas will spare language function altogether, provided the adjacent white matter and basal ganglia are not damaged.  The implication is that higher-level integration appears to be fluid and plastic in its underlying anatomy, and the anatomy looks modular through out."  The current consensus refutes this position.  
 The issue of how best to govern a nation is of great importance and should be explored through intellectual, logical debate.  Dahl's book does not carry the weight this topic deserves because he entirely avoids exposure of the logical constructs from which his conclusions stem.  Dahl's unstated presupposition is that democracy is a superior form of government compared with representative democracy.  This presupposition is never discussed and simply assumed true by Dahl.  This is strong evidence that Dahl hopes to persuade, not promote his ideas in this op-ed piece.  Since he offers no logical constructs regarding his specific ideas and avoids direct questioning of potential hazards of his ideas, he does not offer the non-critically thinking reader pause for review.  Instead he promotes safe, non-threatening ideas that will be easily agreed to by the reader.  Once the reader is agreeing with what is said it is nearly effortless to get the reader to agree to the next idea, even if the two ideas are completely unrelated.  In fact, the very fashion in which Dahl presented his justification for changing the constitution was one such trick.    Dahl states that during the time of the constitutional convention we were far less technologically advanced.  He tells the reader that DaVinci could have done absolutely marvelous things had modern technology been at his dispose.  This is certainly debatable if one were to stop and question what circumstances allowed DaVinci to do what he had done.  However, for most, this is an idea that will be readily agreed to and will strike imagination and hope, exactly the combination needed to persuade people of such things as Dahl desires.  Dahl never strikes his assumption that technological advances also bring about social and political advances, for which he could have at least made a case.  He never brings the topic for discussion and simply behaves as if the point had been struck.  However, societal advances are not directly conjured through technological advances and in many cases societal norms become less democratic (what Dahl would call more advanced) with technological advances.  And thus, we can see why Dahl avoided intellectual debate and instead opted for a trick.  This is an old, extremely effective sales trick which has personally been used to do things like sell movies to people that did not own a television and found movies morally wrong.  This anecdote is not just presented to expose Dahl's method, but is also presented here to strike a point:  People are gullible and will easily agree to do things to which they are morally opposed, much less unsure of or apathetic to.  This is the very reason to avoid a direct democracy and there are historical examples of such things happening, which of course, Dahl fails to acknowledge.  Furthermore, it is precisely self-serving tricksters that the founding fathers had in mind when writing the constitution--no wonder Dahl detests it so.  Dahl uses others tricks that an unsuspecting reader will miss.  For example, Dahl goes through some effort to legitimize his term "founding framers," in preference to "founding fathers."  This has absolutely no relevance to the discussion of representative government versus pure democracy.  However, what it does do is remove a name that places the creators of the constitution on a pedestal and replaces it with something less reverent.  This is not to suggest that changing the name to "founding framers," and removing some of the reverence is a bad thing.  But combined with the other tricks in this book, it is highly suspicious and comes across as name calling.    Furthermore, it is a rather surprising move on Dahl's part after he showed such deftness with persuasion (discussed in the previous paragraph) in other parts of the book.  The reason it is surprising is that the very people he would hope to convince would likely be the people that would put his book away after reading this passage.  Dahl is certainly not a dumb individual; so for whom is this book written, the like minded or the variant of Dahl?  It is most likely the latter of the two. He claims that Tocqueville predicted a "collapse of society," due to the nature of a pure democracy and gives examples of trials which modern societies have faced without collapsing.  Yet, again, he fails to address the heart of his argument and instead opts for something safe and at best tangent to his point, i.e. wars and depression which have nothing to do with the nature of democracy causing a legislative overload and collapse.  And yet, Tocqueville is highly accurate when he discusses the stifling laws and regulations that will govern a purely democratic state.  On needs to look no further than license requirements for bicycles in modern democratic countries.  Dahl claims he believes in "intrinsic equality," which he defines as inalienable political equality among all citizens.  He further claims that the intrinsic equality is what not only allows but actually promotes democracy because the majority population will respect the intrinsic equality of the minority population.  So, live and let live, allow for consideration of differences of opinion on even the most important subjects is what Dahl claims to believe in and promote.  However, talk is cheap.  Dahl later states, "...it is difficult for me to see how a significantly different proposition could be defended, particularly if we draw on crucial historical cases...," (131).  He later refers to his own judgments as, "prudent," while referring to the judgments of others as based in "hopeless ignorance."  It appears that Dahl fails to uphold the very standard he promotes as being the basis for a pure democracy.    Dahl directly states that he considers his own opinions correct and prudent and perceives views in variation from his own as invalid.  He claims that the founding fathers had personal motivations and designed our government to promote their own interests.  He claimed that people today are superior that people in the past.  And because of these things, it must seem to Dahl that the debate of a purely democratic society versus a representative democracy is moot.  That said, merit exists in some of his points and objections about our current government.  However, his methods of tricking and avoiding direct promotion of his ideas are distasteful and less effective than its compliment.  Without allowing the reader preview to arguments, one cannot accurately gauge Dahl's position and thus cannot identify where differences of opinion stem.  Since it is highly unlikely that Dahl will be charged with the tasks of creating a new constitution, it is likely that Dahl's work will only benefit his cause by creating a stir among his like-minded, which is certainly not respectful to Dahl's dissenters.      If offered the opportunity, it would be of great interest to hear what Dahl would say regarding the role of pure democracy in the fall of Athens, or to have him explain what mechanism would prevent a pure democracy from passing arbitrary or spiteful laws into action.  Or perhaps it would be good to see a working example of a successful pure democracy in business or politics (money and power); the two things that ultimately drive government action.  These are the issues that his concepts bring forth and since he wholly failed to address them, his book lacks the weight required to address how to best govern a free body of people. 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
 Also, the book itself is complete crud, being nothing more tangible than one would expect to find in the National Enquirer 
 WARNING !!! This book is not the real Book, but just a study guide (has got solutions to the orginal book). Some parts of the description of the book gives an impression that this is the paperback edition of the hardcoer version (# ISBN-10: 0735202389 # ISBN-13: 978-0735202382) And in one of the options in the Hardcopy page this product is shown as the paperback version of the hardcopy. Fact is that both the books are different 
 Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb."  When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast."  But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).   It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man 
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 JIll gave me her recipies for Prime rib,Yorkshire puddin, mushrooms, brussles spurouts, Pasta melonaze and others years ago and they are a staple in my home.  I gotta get her book before it is too late 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 I was going to buy this but at this price I expect a correct photograph and description. I'm also a bit concerned about the warranty. 6 months seems a little short, all things considered. And I bought a reconditioned kitchenaid food processor last year and not only was the item not properly described but the warranty was not what was stated on Amazon's web page 
 I adored the movie Moulin Rouge and the soundtrack is one my favorite CDs but the book was a great let down. I was hoping to find a written explaantion of how Moulin Rouge was made and to see pictures from this glorious film. Instead it seems more like an overpriced graphic novel. The fact that there is not one clear photograph of either Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor is ridiculous. Hopefully some one else will write a real book about the making of the film 
 Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That  made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end 
 Pashazade is a novel with a unique premise that fails to fulfill its potential. It is a cyberpunk mystery set in an alternate future wherein the Ottoman Empire was not destroyed as a result of WWI. Sadly, the novel is more cyberpunk than Ottoman, which is a weakness. The original setting is merely peripheral, so the plot could be transported to any setting and hardly anything would change. Grimwood should have made the setting more integral to the story. A good example is Bangkok 8, wherein the Thai setting and culture are enmeshed with the storyline. That story could not take place anywhere else, primarily because the primary character comes from that setting. In Pashazade, the primary character is an outsider, basically an American. This character is poorly drawn, a composite of mismatched traumas and cyberpunk cliches. I had no emotional investment in his success because he was neither likable nor ever in any jeopardy. The story is run-of-the-mill, and the outcome barely makes sense. The villain is forgettable with no rational agenda other than the acquisition of money. The cyberpunk elements are standard, from the endless branding of clothing to the clubs, music, and drugs. For what it is, it is breezy, descriptive, and written with flair. The action is memorable and occasionally the dialogue is sharp. It is just a shame that a novel with so much promise ended up being so ordinary. 
 Jane Yolen fans hungry for female heroes will be sorely disappointed by this collection.  The "heroic" deeds in many of these stories are pointless.  The epic tone and flat characters make for dull reading.  The stories are drawn from diverse cultures, but so many details are left  unexplained that we are left with a pageantry of exotica.  None of the  heroes feel like real people with whom girls can identify.  The 1 star is  awarded to Yolen's introductory comments about girl heroes and her  granddaughters' letter of response 
 Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts describes marriage as " a supernatural event founded upon a mutual exchange of holy pledges." The authors save this description for the last chapter, however, from the third chapter on the book is creepily christianic. They ultimately trivialize all advice that can be found in seminars, counseling, mentors, and books, presumably, even their own. All that a marriage really needs is religion.  I want my money back 
 should be the real title of this book - 
 This is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them... I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked 
 While I like Dr. Laura & think a lot like her I'm afraid she missed the mark with this CD/Book. I've enjoyed most of her other books but didn't find this one particularly helpful or interesting.  The CD version of the book basically spends hours telling you to get over your bad childhood & move on. It's rarely that easy. The only part of the book I found intersting was Dr. Laura's synopsis of her bad childhood. I think she should write an autobiography 
 I'm not a big fan of the Apostle Paul in many ways, though I've come to value him and his works more highly in the last decade.  It is clear to any student of church history that Paul and the people he trained and taught, and his followers, are the primary reason that Christianity is a major Western religion today.  It is more than likely that without Paul, Christianity would have remained a small offshoot of Judaism for centuries and might never have flowered as it did.  And Cannon makes this clear.  But I found the book very disappointing.  Starting with a highly imaginative history of Paul's life before he became a scholar in Judaism and an arm of the Temple, Cannon has him attending Greek schools of philosophy, and thoroughly enjoying a wide range of female companionship.  When Cannon sends Paul to Jerusalem, it comes about because of the machinations of his mother in a struggle with his father over Paul's future.  (His father being a tentmaker and merchant, who taught Paul the tentmaking by which he earned his bread later in life.)  In Jerusalem, a lot of time is spent on Paul's efforts to become someone important in the Temple, leading to the stoning and martyrdom of Stephen.  Paul's journey to Emmaus is a result of his further political machinations.   Cannon's descriptions of Paul's thinking about faith and God are rather matter-of-fact, very logical, and rather pedestrian.     While Cannon does describe the miracle on that journey to Emmaus, and Paul joining the Christian community, much of the book is taken up with Paul's alleged political struggles in the early church against Peter and James, whom Cannon calls the "Judaizers".  While Cannon rightly attributes the taking of the message to the Gentiles to Paul, he spends what I think an inordinate number of pages dwelling on what he says are the internal political struggles of the early church, especially whether Gentiles should be required to follow Jewish laws.  Cannon attributes the victory of non-Judaizers over the Judaizers entirely to Paul.  He never mentions Peter's vision of the animals being let down in the net, which was, in scripture, God's way of telling Peter that Gentiles did not need to follow Jewish law (or be circumcised, which was the really big sticking point for Gentile converts).  In scripture, this is a major event, and in scripture, as a result of his vision, Peter changed his thinking entirely over the conversion of and welcome to Gentiles, but Cannon doesn't give that vision even one word.  In spending so much time on these internal political battles (which may or may not have occurred), Cannon leaves little space for faith, awe and wonder.  I would not recommend this book. 
 Anyone with intelligence can see that Ann Coulter is not attempting to make any meaningful or objective analysis of politics.  She is using inflammatory marketing to stir up the emotions of the most die-hard, flag-waving conservatives.  Until this attention-seeking labeling of other Americans as 'good' or 'bad' stops, there will never be true understanding of the complexties of American politics or foreign policy by the general public.  I don't agree with Bush's war and I didnt vote for him.  But he's not a 'bad person'; he did not invade Iraq because he is 'evil' or 'stupid'.  I can appreciate both sides of an argument; I can avoid generic categorizations.  I would never watch any news, liberal or conservative, that had a clear political bias.  Why can't Ann Coulter arrive at this same level of common sense?  Well, she wouldnt sell as many books; she wouldnt be on TV.  It has to be "Liberals Hate America" or "The Conservative Nazi Agenda".  We have the duty as thinking Americans, in the most advanced free country in the world, in these modern times of massive amounts of free information, to STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS GARBAGE.  Get the facts and stop relying on a figurehead to spoon feed you your opinions 
 This book provides more confusion and frustration to a student than anything.  It ceases to offer sufficient example problems, while the few problems that do exist pertain to the less important theory.  Also, the  text provides a lack of explaination as to where it gets its values for  constants - nearly all chapter problems require the utilization of some  type of constant, yet the book has no tables of these values.  I actually  had to refer to my thermodynamics text in order to finish the questions  from this book.  It almost seems as if the book was rushed, since it  doesn't explain or justify anything. Finally, I would like to mention that  this was the most expensive of all my texts.  I regret purchasing this  text, as I could have learned more about fluid mechanics in my bathtub than  from this book 
 Listen up, I'm a big-boned gal who has yo-yoed in weight over the years. Thankfully I'm currently on a downswing, and I hope it stays that way.  Which brings me to Hostess Twinkies which are very overrated.  This is one of my least favorite Hostess snacks, if you want the truth.  The sponge cake is stinky 
 As a teacher, I feel that this book can benefit all of my students in their quest for freedom as described by Tarthang Tulku. I especially recommend this resource for persons interested in learning more about their internal mechanisms or patterns of conditioning. This book has helped me learn what Freedom is really about in contrast to our president and others who base their understanding of freedom on religious beliefs, insecurities and prejudices 
 This author has one heck of a writing style. It's all over the place!  He appears to be a well informed guy, but he's very hard to follow. He uses lots of dashes, parentheses, and notes about other chapters. Plus, there are many overuses of words such as "insofar" and "per se," which disrupt the entire flow of reading. It is not what I expected at all and am pretty disappointed 
 Following Orson Welles' fascinating yet tantalizing career can be frustrating for the aficionado.  So much of his oeuvre remains hidden from view that each discovery from the archives is greeted with an inordinate amount of enthusiasm.  Take this intriguing yet relatively disappointing collection of documentaries Welles directed for British TV in the 1950s.  "The missing link in Welles' work," exults the snapcase boilerplate.  This is a bit of an overstatement, given that far more significant works haven't seen the light of day ("Don Quixote" and "The Other Side of the Wind," to name a couple). The documentaries do help to fill the gap in Welles' output for the 1950s, a decade in which he directed only three feature films.  "Around the World" is a good quality DVD and unquestionably the work of Welles, but a ultimately a shadow of what he was capable of.    The five episodes on this DVD explore various aspects of European Culture.  Welles takes his camera in search of Basque country, Spanish bullfights, the idiosyncratic denizens of Paris' St Germain des Pres, and the loquacious and venerable Chelsea Pensioners.  The "St Germain des Pres" episode best typifies the offbeat subject matter.  Welles spends most of his time interviewing a commune dweller who makes his own clothes.  After that, Welles dashes through the town, capturing glimpses of celebrities like Jean Cocteau and Eddie Constantine ("Lemmy Caution"), before discovering a group of "Letterists" who are dedicated to (you guessed it) inventing new letters.   Unfortunately, Welles' typically low budget and the nature of the subject matter limit his range of cinematic expression.  Despite the exotic and obscure locales, most of the footage consists of relatively static interviews, captured in long takes with obligatory reaction shots of Welles inserted to break up the monotony.  Even the bullfight episode lacks the dynamic footage one might expect; Welles' camera is grounded in the stands, preventing him from getting involved in the action.  Only towards the end of "St. Germain des Pres" and in the second Basque episode does Welles get inventive, developing the active, swirling camera style he employed in films like "Mr. Arkadin."    Like a record that's worth owning for one or two songs, "Around the World with Orson Welles" does have one episode that justifies its purchase: the second Basque episode.  True, the first few minutes repeat the introduction from the first Basque show, but after that Welles has a lot of fun interviewing kids playing 'pelote' (a game similar to jai alai).  Welles gets his camera into the pelote action, and seems rejuvenated by the subject matter. An 11-year old boy joins Welles and acts as a tour guide for the rest of the show.  The episode ends dramatically, with Welles quoting a Basque aphorism against a night sky lit by fireworks.    For a better example of Welles' creativity in the documentary genre, check out his 1974 essay film, "F for Fake," just released on DVD.  "Around the World with Orson Welles" is a far more pedestrian effort, but it does give Welles fans something to look at while they await the more significant releases that are hopefully on the not-too-distant horizon 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 I cried.  No, scratch that, I sobbed...from boredom.         
 The cover of mine was decorated with the actress from the movie so I expected it to be the tragic romance with a happy ending on the DVD. Instead I got a description of a couple of college proffessors who cash in their investments to buy a million dollar run down house in Cortona Italy in which they only planned to live in 3 months out of the year.   It doesn't tell a story so much as it describes one, like an outline with too much external detail. It has no dialouge whatsoever so it's very one dimensional. The only thing I got out of it was a strong desire to go buy a lemon tree and see the landscapes of Italy. 
 GIVEN KERIK'S REPORTED MOB TIES, AMORALITY AND CASHING IN ON THE 9/11 TRAGEDY, IT'S NO SURPRISE TO READ THIS CON JOB PIECE OF FICTION. HIS GHOSTWRITER IS PROBABLY A FICTION WRITER BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT IS WELL WRITTEN, THE STORY IS A FRAUD. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN SAUDI ARABIA? HE STALKED AND TERRORIZED WOMEN ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST. WHY DIDN'T MR. LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO CLAIMED TO BE SO HIGHLY SKILLED THAT HE COULD TRACK DOWN THE BIGGEST DRUG LORDS IN THE WORLD...TRACK DOWN HIS OWN INFANT DAUGHTER --THE ONE HE ABANDONED? HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH? HE IS A CON MAN, ABANDONED HIS OWN CHILD, IS EGOMANIACAL AND IS NOTHING MORE THAN A THUG. HE WRITES ABOUT SOME TEACHER IN SCHOOL WHO TOLD HIM HE WOULD NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING. GUESS WHAT? HE WAS RIGHT. BERNARD KERIK IS JUST WHAT THAT TEACHER SAID HE'D BE. A BIG ZERO 
 This book is full of errors and contridictions. As mentioned by another reviewer, the hurricane entitled Lizzie originates off the Cape Verde Islands near Africa (paperback edition, pg 25 para 2), travels EAST (pg 104 para 1) WEST (pg 116 para 4) again EAST (pg132 para 4), SOUTHEAST (pg 144 para 6), all the while traveling in a straight line, as if on a railroad track (again pg 104, para 1). I always thought the Caribbean was west of Africa. Also, not necessarily an error but a bit misleading, the hruricane moves about 50 miles into Nicaragua and dies. This is from the east coast (pg 144, para 6), but later when discussing the damage there, the statement is made that next to Haiti, the WEST coast of the country is the poorest stepchild of the Western Hemisphere (pg 182 para 1) Another bit of confusion is the statement regarding service provided by Commodore Vanderbilt moving people across Nicaragua, CUTTING OFF HUNDREDS OF MILES BY NOT SAILING AROUND CAPE HORN BUT ALSO SAVING ANOTHER THOUSAND MILES BYPASSING THE ISTHMUS AT PANAMA. ????????????? A contridiction occurs when the book states that they will be pumping the South Equatorial Current into the Pacific (pg 369 para 2) but into the Atlantic (pg 421 para 4) There are other misconceptions in the book, such as the characters yelling at one another because they are standing near a noisy ventilation fan while endeavoring to be stealthy. Loud noises do not necessarily mask other sounds near them, loud noises make it hard to hear when the listener is close to them. Try standing near your running garbage grinder and speaking to someone further away; they can hear you, you can't hear them. Althgether a hard book to read, confusing to say the least. Not up to the standards of some of his earlier books. 
 What I as a student found lacking in this book: 1.) It has many problems, which is a good thing, but this fact is negated by its lack of a publically available solutions manual and numerous and obvious misprints. 2.) Many of the examples gloss over important points to note and I found many vague and cursory.  The instructor I had used more detailed material from other textbooks.  Many examples also appeared to be used as a substitute for generalized text explainations and diagrams.  It also seemed rather vague on the more theroetical aspects of the material.  Considering all the other Statics textbooks out there, chances would favor some of them being a lot better than this one.  And taking into account the price, I would consider this book a total waste of resources.  If you're a mechanical engineering or aerospace student, you'll probably need a better introduction than this if you hope to survive the more advanced courses 
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.   I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.   The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time 
 Even though some of the stories are interesting, this book is nothing short of average.  Had little to do with the title.  
 In school you are sometimes asked to summarize extremely lengthy books into one or two sentences to evaluate your knowledge on that certain piece of literature.  To me, that always seemed ridiculous because how could you accurately depict the true value of a 300-page book within two measly paragraphs?  That feeling is exactly my reaction to Ridley Scott's overly produced and underly executed film, Legend.  Throughout the film I felt that Scott had the potential to go anywhere and everywhere, really making this underground cult fantasy film bigger than The Neverending Story and Lord of the Rings put together.  I felt this way because 80s fantasy films seemed to be less commercial and more imaginative than those released in the past decade.  I was waiting for a stronger outing of Willow, but instead I saw Legend disintegrate right before my eyes.  It was as if Ridley had 300-plus pages of material, but had to condense it all into two very small paragraphs.  What ultimately happened was that we, the viewer, were cheated out of quite a bit of potential visuals, creative lands, and mythical creatures.  We were instead handed a body of work that seemed to grasp at straws instead of development, weak heroic characters with an exaggeration on Curry's over-the-top "Price of Darkness" portrayal, and a finale that teetered on sarcasm instead of excitement.    Legend, in my eyes, begins with an unsettling "bang".  We see no characters outside of a menacing voice that speaks in rhyme and talks about the end of light.  Scott pulls us gracefully in by giving us these highly imaginative characters and a world that we think will be full of Hensen-esque creatures.  Alas, immediately after pulling at our dark sides, he slaps us in the face with what seems like an hour of pointless drivel with conversation between the Princess Lilly and her man-boy Jack (played by Mia Sara and Tom Cruise respectively).  Caught between horrid writing, unfamiliar past experiences, and a uni-brow the size of Kansas on Cruise's face, we are left with nothing to do except wait.  With the promise of unicorns and a possible dark future, we wait.  The unicorns finally appear and darkness does become momentarily triumphant, but what never brings us back to that immediate opening of dark delight is that Scott never recreates it for us.  Legend fails, not just because of the shallow acting, but because the story never quite hits the momentum it had at the beginning of the film.  While this critic blames Ridley's choice of Sara and Cruise as our guides, I do think he could have strengthened the story to be a bit more energetic and sweeping.  I felt trapped throughout this story, as if the walls that contained Princess Lilly were the actual boundaries of the film.  This hurt Legend.  Unlike other fantasy films of this nature, the walls of a structure may encase our hero, but we know there are bigger and more exotic things happening around the fictional planet.  With Legend, I never felt that.  I felt as if Scott kept us on a lighted path without the comfort or luxury of any outside imagination.  I needed, maybe even wanted, to see more of this planet Scott created, but the door was shut abruptly in my face.  I would like to state again that I thought Scott had good intentions with this film, but the final result (either from its original bad screenings to the infamous "director's cut") just didn't feel like it was worth the two hours one had to put into the movie.  Scott had some (I stress "some") moment of excitement, moments of imagination, and moments of sheer fantasy, but they were all clouded by the brazen push of over-the-top melodrama and visions.  What makes most fantasy films work is that you care both for the story as well as the characters.  In Legend, the story seems weak because we care nothing for the characters.  Cruise's portrayal of Jack could have been done by anyone who passed Acting 101, while Curry does give the BEST performance of the film, it is another case of "anyone-itis".  Without the horns or the bold eyes, anyone could have been underneath the mask.  Curry did great, but take him out of the costume and ask the question, does he stand-alone?  Follow this up with some elves and dwarves that seemed more clichï¿½ than original, and the final result is an ill-fated Legend.  I wanted to like this film.  I knew about the cult-ish status of Scott's fantasy attempt, but in the end, I felt bored instead of moved by the overall picture.   Overall, I cannot recommend a second viewing to this film.  I went in expecting a larger-than-life Willow or Neverending Story (or at least enough darkness to counter Alien or Blade Runner), but instead finished the film thinking that in today's standards this would have counted as a "direct to video" release.  Scott, as well as his brother, are fabulous directors and continue to push the boundaries on modern cinema, but Legend failed.  Legend failed because of the story as well as the acting.  Both were not in place, therefore, both could not work together.  During the commentary, Scott mentions his passion for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, but it was obvious that he was just name-dropping to gain film critic's respect.  Legend, if anything, insults Cocteau's masterpiece.  From the wrongly used word of the title (not a legend but a fairy-tale), to Cruise's uni-brow, to the cheaply forgettable ending, Legend didn't impress and it would be very difficult to sit through another viewing without some cash in hand.             Grade: ** out of **** 
 I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW POOR THIS PRODUCT WAS MADE. THE HELL WITH THIS PRODUCT. NOBODAY NOOOOOOOOOBOOOOOODY BUY THSI PRODUCT. TALK ABOUT POOR 
 My second Aeroccino is now not working.  The first one just completely died and this one will only stay on for a couple of seconds before turning off.  I believe that Nespresso needs to overhaul the whole machine before subjecting the public to it!!  Especially, at the price they are charging 
 This movie is superficial and populated with glamorous and unprincipled characters.  Kate Hudson, while photogenic in the extreme, is not believable with her fake and shaky Irish accent.  The plot is unbelievable, and the characters are offensive.  The structure of the film is clumsy, and the idea that any sort of trusting relationship and marriage is possible with these people who can not keep it in their shorts (including Hudson) is naive and unworldly, rather than the reverse.   The false sense of lighthearted sophistication is tedious.  Don't bother.   
 I wish I could give it 0 stars.  Davis writes more about himself than the blues.  The pronoun "I" is his favorite word.  BORING. P.S. Only one mention of Johnny Winter... 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 I loved the first book (and all of her other works) but this one while it held my attention also annoyed me.  Way too much time was given to the spoiled little girl and she lost me from the very beginning when it was explained that if she didn't get to watch the movie every day she screamed.  Sadly the adults were almost as spoiled as the children and it was hard to feel any kind of sympathy or empathy for the main character when she was the one who had created these brats 
 This shouldn't even be considered a baseball movie!  That is like calling M. Night Shamalan's "Signs" a baseball movie because the one guy played baseball.  Not worth it at all 
 The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.  Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package."  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.  This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.     One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.  In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me 
 I didn't like it, I was looking for some profound thoughts to be spilled into my lap but I didn't get them.  I am not sure if in the time that it was written it was completely out of the ordinary with its contraversial "philosophy" but I didnt get much out of it.  It seemed to be steared towards a more self loathing, unhappy and hermit crowd. I prefer something more thought provoking and honestly different.  But maybe I missed a lot, I was almost falling asleep through most of it. 
 It's difficult to understand how Ms. McEwan, who so perfectly personified Lucia in the Mapp & Lucia series, could be so mis-directed as Jane Marple. It would help if her prevelent expression were not a simpering smile with always a twinkle in her eye. Miss Marple believed in Evil, and as portrayed by Joan Hickson in the 1980s BBC series this was never in doubt, and that series stands head and shoulders above the new offering. Take a comparative look at the old and new versions of 'The 4:50 From Paddington' and note the new version's salient characterstics are glitz, a dumbed-down story line, and modern actors in historical drag. It's ENTERTAINMENT but it isn't Miss Marple. Go for the gold, buy the old 
 The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head.  Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.  If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you.  Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet 
 This was hardly a diet book, rather it is an infomercial posing as literature.  Every other sentence seems to be about the virtues not of the diet but of a specific product.  Macademia Nut Oil, and not just any generic macadamia nut oil but instead only one specific brand.  Not too surprisingly other reviewers have indicated that the good doctor apparently is the owner of the company.  I can't believe the positive reviews here, they had to be posted by someone in the author's employment.  This book was such an insult to anyone with intelligence.  Another reviewer refered to the author as a SNAKE OIL salesman and I highly agree.  Please save your time and money and don't buy this book 
 I've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. So, those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. And speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o.  Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you, so you go and find a "nice girl" because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with a "bad girl" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the "bad girl" because she's a slut, so you go back to the "good girl." But she's not nasty enough for you, so then...around and around we go. Women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us.  He's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Maybe Ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.   What's the music like? Well I'll give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What's Your Fantasy. That's it.  Addendum: 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I'm "wasting' my time giving Ludacris negative reviews. Well, first of all, if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it, everything on Amazon would have 5 stars, which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality.   Secondly, I don't like Ludacris. I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender more respect; but he doesn't. My diatribe above shows what my problem with him is, and I feel that argument is valid. There's no way to critique Ludacris' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women. Why should I like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us? I'm biased against him because he's biased against me. So he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e 
 It's like wiping your monitor off with WD40. Somebody goofed on these. Not sure what I can use these things for now. Yes I know I'm from Alabama and a degree from  the U of A but I need more instructions or a different brand. 
 As this story was being read in elementary school, my daughter found the part where Weasel kills a pregnant wife in front of her husband disturbing.  READERS BEWARE.  Is this actually for children 
 The dynamic Root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children's comedy.  My advice to Root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash.  The only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of the child Curtis.  Big props to my man for his preformance.  Hope to see you in more movies to come. p.s. I think Taylor Root is still a virgin 
 This movie well it was boosted up like it was something really great. It had its moments but man. It had its weak times too. The little monster in this movie was just screaming like a girl the whole movie and that was really annoying. You can check it out. I didn't like it too much though. Oh well thats my opinion. Maybe you can find some good in it. 
 I found this book rhetorical and in some areas misleading. While I can sympathise with the authors' attempts in trying to make sense of the management problem that afflicts industry and government, their resort to claiming that all problems will be fixed through the application of six change forces is pure technique drivel.   To be fair the concepts in the book are now becoming old (1997 reprint) but this does not distance it from deserved criticism. The last thing that the world needs is a dialectic that is predicated upon the Cult of the Leader(Leader Power) and a reverence to the ability of Information Technology to provide a managerial communications fix. Their concentration upon investor power is correct but for the wrong reasons.   Investors are not good at judging customer value and their influence in redirecting customer-centric corporate direction through a compliant CEO has to be viewed with scepticism. Do not misunderstand me, I am not a managerial apologist.   In concurrence with the authors I also believe that bureaucratic managerialism is inefficient and needs reduction. However the methods by which I would achieve this goal is not as socially disruptive as those endorsed by the authors i.e through rampant dismissals. I can understand why the authors state: ' We do not have the abswers' (p.215) to the unemployment dilemma.  The authors focus upon the Customer and upon Simpliicity are some of this book's redeeming features, until the authors start espousing the merits of outsourcing and the tired neo-conservative polemic that privatisation is a better economic model than public ownership. Outsourcing is only advantageous when core-competencies are not lost. The book's tenet revolves around the non-managerialism so would it not make sense to outsource management. Nowhere in the book is this stated.   The latter privatisation/public ownership debate only has currency because we have been and still are existing in a flawed Neoclassical economic milieu that, by historical circumstances, has ruled Western Society since the time of Adam Smith. It is a philosophy that professes a primacy of the individual over community.   Perhaps it is time to review this economic underpinning and start questioning the Neoclassical Economic ceteris paribus assumptions (see page 211) inherent in Neoclassical static economic models, especially in these times when Sustainability issues (ISO900, ISO 14001, etc.) have become paramount.  This latter exercise I think should provide the authors with a better avenue along which to proceed. I am convinced that the Chapter 3 heading is prophetic. I do not believe that this book is sufficiently detailed to provide the world with a blueprint that promises a 'Revolution that has not Happened 
 This film got one star for the scenery.  Of the 135 minutes it was 130 minutes to long and of wasted time.  Don't waste your time with this one 
 This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money. page 364:  Principles of Long term investing:  "Chapter 8 shows that among the S&P 500 Index returns, large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks."  Now look at Chapter 8.  "Of the 10 largest corporations, only 2  (Exxon Mobile and Citigroup) are value stocks."  duuhhh.  Now I know what to do.  I have a choice of two stocks.  If you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket, buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart. If you know little, it won't add to your knowledge at all 
 I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox.  I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo.  It was very disappointing.  The picture was little on my high def screen.  It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen.  I even tried changing the aspect on my television.  No improvement.  Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup 
 I was very anxious to be getting this book, waited on pins and needles for it to arrive.  I don't like Chef Kathleen's writing style - her words do not flow very well, so I had a hard time staying focused.  If the recipes were good I could easily forgive the kooky writing.  I have not tried any of the recipes, but from the ingredients on the majority of them, I'm wondering who in the world would want to???  Salt, pepper, lemon and lime juice are the chef's main ingredients on a lot of recipes.  If you care anything about the taste of food at all, try another book!  
 think about the premise, it's not only creepy, it's just wrong. The August brothers were sexually abused and victimized as young men and now the only way they can feel complete love from a woman is together. I know, I know it's total backwoods Jerry Springer crap!!! I really don't like books like this. Ones that have a racier theme or kink and wrap it up with a bow and call it "fufilling" or "complete love". Where I come from having a threesome or foursome with your brothers is just disturbed!!! And the women in story just buy into this warped way of thinking. I don't know about other ladies but if a guy I was dating suggested this; there would be a me shaped hole in the door, and burnt rubber in the driveway! 
 I expected this book to be a good technical reference (much like just about every other Sam's Teach Yourself book).  The book fails to deliver technical information and is primarily focused on how to perform tasks when USING Sharepoint that just about anyone who can read and click would be able to figure out without the help.  This book is overly simplistic and is targeted to the END USER who is not even familiar with using Internet Explorer (several pages spent on what the different features of IE are) 
 Just received the German 4 disc digipak. GOOD NEWS. played 10 mins of both - no problems. Menus are all in English (or German) all the extra's on the English R2 SE's are here except for the photo gallery.  The sound is very good and the restored english mono is BETTER than the MGM 5.1 also on here with the commentary and German mono. The 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation.  Picture. No problems I could see on my 6ft screen via InFocus 5700 projector from an Arcam FMJ-DV29 DVD player. Player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything.  Only watched first 10mins of each but doing A-B comparisons with the English R2 MGM SE's the German ones are noticeably better, they look less washed out, contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on Fistful, which is why I bought this set, but also on Few Dollars More as well.  They are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly Few Dollars More is at last the full version, which no MGM DVD is worldwide..... 
 This product is horrible!!!!! I had to send the first one back because it broke the second day that my child had it.  It took several weeks for us to get the new one and when it finally did come it broke after three days of use. 
 I purchased this for my 11 year old son.  I am so thankful that I read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it.  The pictures are hand drawn but graphic.  Far too much detail for the target audience. Kids need to know about sexuality but they don't need to know EVERYTHING before they are even teen-agers.  I would be upset to find this in a school library.  This book definitely needs to be used with supervision. I returned this book as I believe its content is inappropriate for the cover advertised age of 10 years old. 
 This is a good book if you have never owned rabbits and this will be one of a few a books that you plan on reading, because despite the authors experience and education on the subjects in the book he seems as if he is rushing it just a little, granted it is old (last pub date was 1988), and also as if he is preaching his way rather than letting you develop experience through guidance through learning your own way, there are ways to screw up and there are those who get it no matter what. I highly suggest that you do your research before you consider owning rabbits, I disagree with the authors view on raising rabbits primarily for meat, with my animals I raise primarily for the coats and angora wool which I tan the hides and spin with down from my chickens) and sell them locally, meat is mearly a by product for me and believe me it can really help on your grocery bill. Just do yourself and all the rest of us who are in this business a favor, educate yourself first before you even buy a rabbit 
 I am dissatisfied with Lush's claims that many of its products, like this one, are natural.  I encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in Lush's products.  I have yet to see a Lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety.  There are numerous other brands of truly all-natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently 
 Stephen Dobyns has consistently been a boring poet, that is, he calls himself a poet and his editors have gone along with the subterfuge.  He writes mostly prose broken into lines.  When he reads, his prosiness becomes even more apparent and unbearable. Why is he considered one of the country's best poets?  I have no idea.  The only thing I can figure is that we have reached the sorry pass where our academic MFA professors and their students like anything that doesn't sound like poetry.  No need to despair, though.  There are still good poets out there.  YOu likely won't find them being published in the pages of our most "respected" journals, like APR or Poetry, however 
 I was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. This is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.  I usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  She told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.  It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on Scholastic's.  No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. I believe that as a parent, I'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so I can make an informed decision.  Anise Hollingshea 
 "Phase 10" is little more than an Uno knockoff--even sharing some of the same "special" cards: "Skip" and "Wild". Then, there are the so-called "phases", which can ultimately be frustrating for both young players, and new players. Example:  Phase 3 is a set of 4 cards (4 of the same number) and a run of 4 cards (a straight). You may have the following cards: (g=green, r=red, b=blue, o=orange) 2g, 3r, 4r, 6o, 6g, 9b, 11b, 11r, 12b, wild. Ultimaely, the player before you draws a "wild" card, and completes their phase. You, however get stuck with 85 points.  With all the flaws, the game can still be competitive and fun.  If you want something educational though, buy a Leappad 
 Nothing in the description indicates that this is heavily abridged. The introduction (after you've purchased the book) actually refers to this version not as translated (no translator is credited) but paraphrased. It is not even partitioned into St. Augustine's original 13 "books," but is instead resectioned with "new" chapter titles. I had to repurchase the book 
 I cannot imagine why a friend gave me this book. Maybe she meant it for my grandmother. This book is scary. It is so dated with rooms crammed with stuff. The same boring, old-fashioned mood runs through it 
 I ordered this item because my daughter, almost 5, loves music and i want to teach her a lot about classical music. unfortunately the delivery (cartridge) was defect and i can't return as i am living in switzerland. i got the money back but i am still disappointed. 
 The chefs asked to relate their biggest catastrophes seem to have misunderstood that direction. Instead, most of them have used this forum to impart their bottomless pits of wisdom, and stroke their own egos at the same time. Aside from a couple (trust me, only about two were real culinary catastrophes) of anecdotes, this book was  monotonous. The "catastrophes" consisted of chefs relating their travel experiences in France, "how-to" advice for starting your own restaurants, and other stories that have really nothing to do with culinary catastrophes. Most frequently the chefs would include a moral of the story at the end of his/her piece.   The only two worthwhile stories are from Tony Bourdain and the Two Hot Tamales.   Don't buy this book. Go to the bookstore and read the two stories I mentioned above. It will take about ten minutes and make you laugh. If you buy this book and read the whole thing, it will take you hours to read and in the end you will cry that you spent money on this literary catastrophe 
 The author certainly knows a lot about the subject, however he fails to make the book readable. Run-away sentences filled with precise numbers, most probably taken out of the sky, results in totally unreadable text. The book reminded me of a really boring free newspaper, except the editor never learned to use a spell checker.   Apart from really poor language skills, some "facts" are really doubtful. For example, on page 9, Les Henderson writes that "... it is impossible to recover anything to compensate their victims because most of their money has gone to purchase recreational drugs...". I have hard time to believe that criminals smart enough to come up with a working fraud scheme cannot come up with a better use of the money then drugs. Then again, what do I know...  I also absolutely hated the way particular facts are mixed and equated with generalizations, such as the bulleted list on pages 33-34, which includes vitamins, promotional items and ... "small trinkets of minimal value compared to the payments made".  In any case, I would not recommend to buy this book unless you are studying this particular subject and have no other sources of information on it 
 I was disappointed in the book. It lacked some of what had been promised in the way of scientific documention, etc. Just another variation on the numerous spin-offs of the Atkins/South Beach approach 
 I have seen "Feast of All Saints" twice and every time it has been harder to watch. I would not recommend this film especially if you cannot stomach violence and graphic images. Overall, it attempts to provide a history lesson, but if you are seeking knowledge of the quadroons & mulatto people of that era pick up a history book with historical facts 
 McCarthy is a very talented writer (read Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses) but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing, using many archaic words. Suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot. Despite the novel's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character. Certain chapters are interesting (the workhouse chapter especially), but these passages are few and far between. Also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way. McCarthy writes about nature beautifully, but after finishing this book, one is left unfulfilled. 
 some of these stories or so corny for example in the story Delcardes' cat kull invites a talking cat to live in the palace the cat's servant is throwing his voice into the cat to try to get kull to agree to Delcardes forbidden choise of husband. So Thusa doom the most powerfull necromancer in the history of the world is reduced tying up the cats servant and throwing his voice into the cat to lure kull into a deadly trap in the end thusa doom is unmasked in front of everyone, shakes him fist and escapes "i'll get you yet kull" so much for the power of necromancy, this story reads like a scooby doo cartoon this book is so corny it's kind of cool. Kull is worth a read but don't expect to much and don't pay alot of this book 
 The Alex Cross series by James Patterson started out incredibly strong with a couple of excellent novels to the start the series in "Along Came a Spider" and "Kiss the Girls."  These novels were truly exceptional when it came to being edge of the seat thrillers, page turners, and plot twisters.  They were a standard by which I and many others judged other novels in this genre.  As the Cross series continued, the quality of the novels began to decline.  For one, Cross is supposed to be a detective.  However, as this series has progressed, he has done less and less detective work.  He usually just follows leads until he happens upon the villain, and then Cross is praised as a major hero.  Second, the plot twists, for which this series use to be famous for, have become very contrived.  Instead of that "I can't believe I didn't see that coming feeling," or "man, was I fooled" sensation, the plot twists frequently leave me saying, "that was absolutely ridiculous."  Many of these very flaws have found their way into "Londond Bridges."  This novel picks up where "Big Bad Wolf" left off.  Some sort of Russian mad man has created a criminal empire, is capable of unspeakable cruelty, and has more criminal plans to execute.  Cross, formerly of the Washington P.D. and now with the FBI, has been tasked with tracking down the Wolf.  This novel, like the others in the series, switches back from first to third person story telling.  When the chapters focus on Cross, they frequently are told in first person from Cross's point of view.  When other characters are central to the storytelling, then the narrative switches to third person.    This is not necessarily a bad thing, but in the later chapters, the third person omniscient narrator lies to the reader!  To be clear, the narrarator doesn't provide clues and lets the reader jump to their own conclusion.  The narrator deliberately tells the reader something that isn't so.  Then, the narrator attempts to turn this into a plot twist a few pages later.  This is extremely aggravating.  Many, if not most, of the plot twists in this novel just come off flat.  To a certain degeree, you are left asking "who cares?" or thinking to yourself "he couldn't possibly thought he got him this time."  The redeeming quality of this book is that Patterson doesn't pull punches.  Several monuments, buildings, and bridges throughout the world are targetted by the Wolf.  Don't expect last second rescues.  In addition, Cross's personal life has more and more problems thrown at it.  The resolution of those problems doesn't happen easily, but at least Pattrson doesn't let Cross off easily.  My opinion is that perhaps Patterson has spread himself a little too thin across all his projects.  He just posted in his blog that he has five, and maybe six, novels to come out next year.  It appears the focus needed to make a great Cross novel is lacking.  I've heard good things about "Mary, Mary," the next novel in the series, so I suspect I will pick that one up.  However, it is potentially my last Cross, if not Patterson, novel.  Overall:  2.5 star 
 'Nightmare City' aka 'City of the Walking Dead' aka 'Invasion of the Atomic Zombies' (by far the best title) is pretty much the most reviled film of the European zombie cycle of the early 80's.  I don't think this is entirely fair.  Personally, I think this movie is better than Mattei's 'Hell of the Living Dead'.  But, that ain't much of a prize, and this film is pretty damn lousy.  But, it's still worth seeing if you're a zombie fan.  So, as I always say, if you've even heard of this movie, you'll probably think seeing it is worth your time.  In some ways this film is slightly better than average.  The scenes not involving the zombies are relatively competent, perhaps slightly better than what you'd usually get in this sorta film.  None of the characters are remotely interesting, but the acting is not atrocious, if not good either, and the dialogue is rarely laughable. (Except for Anna's ridiculous, luddite social commentary.  And that's funny due to the content, rather than the delivery.)  The problem with this film is the zombies themselves.  Now,  I'm not a total zombie purist, but I can't call this a real zombie film.  I don't care that they run,  and I don't care that they aren't dead (or maybe they are. I forget.  Don't care either  way.)  The problem is that they always use weapons and tools.  Now, it's one thing to use these items sporadically, but they do it all the damn time.  For the most part, these supposed zombies just run up and stab people.  Not very zombie like.  Furthermore, they just aren't animalistic enough.  The fast zombies in '28 Days Later' and the new 'Dawn of the Dead' were at least wild and out of control.  These ones just seem like murderous people with gunk on their heads.  What it all comes down to is that these zombies are just lame.  They look terrible, with just some ridiculous lumpy crusty crud on their heads, at best, or just some black goo. Lame behavior and lame appearence= LAME.  I think if they'da made this with regular zombies it could've been a middle of the road zombie pic, and if they had some decent gore.  The gore in this is terrible, other than a few amusing exploding heads.  It's not especially gory for this sort of film either, though again, this isn't much of a loss considering the quality of it.  There's not too much else to say, it's just a lotta angry zombies running around cutting people up.  Reasonably amusing, but not much more than that.  The only really great moment is when a pack of zombies bursts in on an operation, and one surgeons flings a scalpel across the room and into one of the zombies necks.  That was pretty sweet.  Yeah, that's it.  Amusing, but just barely.  Grade: D 
 "Looking inside" above shows you the old version of this book, not the N10-003 version. You might not notice that this book has been updated though. It tells you that there are 72 questions on the test and that you have to score a 664 (?) to pass. In reality (I just took the test yesterday (and passed)), there are 85 questions and you only need a 554 to pass.  Some of the information supplied is contradictory, incorrect or not updated: the book only talks about Bluetooth v.1 at 720kps when v.2 is out and offers 2.45mbps. Other network+ books have this newer info.  The most reliable and realistic part of this book is the MeasureUp CD. Don't expect to be able to find the answers to some of these test questions in the Exam Cram book though; they're not there.   Bottom-line: You can probably pass the test with just this book, but you will run into questions mentioning things that are totally absent from the book. Spend your hard-earned dollars elsewhere 
  Ed Klein is really so desperate in his attack that he can't find any one person who will use their names in the attacks against Hillary!     What a lot of misinformation and outright lies. To actually accuse Marian Wright Edelman of using children for her own ends is short of criminal, and to insinuate that Chelsea was the result of a rape, even though on the next page he discusses their fertility search to become pregnant, is disgusting.     I should have known what to expect when the first two words in the book were Monica Lewinsky!  
 I have been in Technical analysis for more than 4 years and have many books on the subject but of all the books I have "The Encyclopedia of Technical Market Indicators" is the most misguided title ever. Motivation for this statement is that the book is almost like an empty vessel. The author relates to numerous indicators and indicates how successful or unsuccessful they are but without explanations which make it difficult to comprehend. Also nowhere in the book does he indicate how these indicators should be used which, in my opinion, should be the essence of a book with this title. The author attempts to correct this on his website at: www.robertwcolby.com 
 Self proclamation does not a doctor make.  Dr Laura's credential's are not within the field of psychotherapy-she who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness, has been estranged from her own family for years.  She who points the finger---has also had the finger pointed at her.  Posing nude, living with a man without the benefit of marriage, having an affair, becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage, have all been written about Dr. Laura Schlessinger and made public.  Noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite, unless of course, they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent 
 oh yoko you did it again. I love The Beatles, but what has been done in this CD is unremarkable 
 In only a thousand words??!  How could anyone describe how bad this book is in a thousand words? The author starts out to prove that Sagan was wrong and ends up proving that he was right.  This is about as bad as  pseudoscience gets.   I started off willing to be objective, but I started  laughing after page eleven.  Don't buy this book; it's simply silly and  often so bad that I have to think the author meant to lie and cheat 
 As brevity is the soul of wit, let me be brief.  First of all, I found reading this book to be an arduous task.  I feel the same way that Joseph Conrad did, namely, I saw no emotion in it. Let me take just one sentence out to illustrate: "...in order to distinguish in...Gilberte an indefinable quality analogous in the world of the emotions to what in the world of colours is called infra-red, my parents would have needed that supplementary sense with which love had temporarily endowed me."  I imagine that if I were to write this sentence, my writing instructor's red ink comments would be "Wordy, awkward, over intellectual".  Compare Proust's sentence with how John Steinbeck expressed the same sentiment: "Once, when I raptured in a violet glow given off by the Queen of the World, my father asked me why, and I thought he was crazy not to see. Of course I know now she was a mouse-haired, freckle-nosed, scabby-kneed little girl with a voice like a bat and the loving kindness of a gila monster, but then she lighted up the landscape and me".   This pretty much sums up my reaction to this book.  I cannot recommend it to anyone, no matter how famous the book is and no matter if it won the Prix Goncourt, and no matter how intelligent Proust was, and no matter how many people say they wouldn't have wanted to go to their grave without having read it.  All I can say is, Read it, and see for yourself why you shouldn't read it (paraphrasing Samuel Goldwyn).  
 My order arrived quickly but upon FIRST use, the clasp broke on this necklace.  Since it wasn't an expensive item, I joined the ends together with a small wire ring I already owned, since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced...perhaps with another faulty item.  As they say, "you get what you pay for! 
 I admire David Kushner's writing skills - he can tell a good story and seems to do the needed research. I loved his "Masters of Doom".   "Jonny Magic" is the story of Jon Finkel, who transformed himself from being an overweight, bullied teenage nerd who could play a great game of Magic into a 20-something millionaire who mastered the casinos and could play a great game of Poker. He lost weight, rode the crest of the (still) current Poker phenomenon, and belongs right up there in the "Useless People Hall of Fame" along with various winners of reality, survival, and celebrity programs. Finkel became successful at something of no real use to society. And Kushner misses that aspect of the story. It's not that Finkel didn't have great talent, and he did accomplish something admired by many. Kushner tells that story, although - as others have observed - the book lacks drama, and is actually a little boring. But just ponder the difference between the "two Johns" in "Masters of Doom" and the "one Jon" in "Jonny Magic", and you have the makings of a really interesting story. Still untold.   A lot changed in the few years between the era of "Masters of Doom" and that of "Jonny Magic". Finkel's life says much about the world we live in today. It's really unfortunate that Kushner is not taking the lead in writing about this, since he has been commenting on parts of it for the past dozen years, and should have some perspective by now. There is room for good journalism in these topics, and I think Kushner has the skills to produce it. Instead, he settled for a quick write about a hot topic, once again repeating the pattern of "Wow - look at this - a genius nerd becomes a success and has the last laugh."   
 I used this cream for three weeks, two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter- from brown it went to pink. But I skipped one day and it all went back. You pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day 
 This was the first audio book I ever listened to. Perhaps that is why I found it rather boring and unexciting. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had read it myself instead of listening to Joe Mantegna reading it. I hate to criticize Mr. Mantegna because I really liked him when I used to watch the show, "Joan of Arcadia." But there were many places where I would have accented certain words differently and I found myself getting upset at the way he read it in some parts. I love "lawyer books" but have certainly read better.  At any rate, this audio book was not worth the money I paid for it ... even though I bought it on sale. Maybe I am just not a "candidate" for audio books. I thought it would amuse me while driving to and from work and to my house at the shore ... and it did up to a point. I am now looking for audio books that are cheaper because they just go too quickly for me. I am now trying to find someone to give it to and I am also trying to find more audio books to try that are not so expensive. I guess I should re-join the library if I want to continue listening to audio books 
 It is extemely difficult to select stories from five of the greatest SF writers (add Clarke and Asimov and you have the top seven) of the 20th century to give the whole volume a negative, downbeat tone, but Fred Pohl has managed it.  If you like your stories upbeat and hopeful for the human race (in the editorial fashion of John Campbell) this book is a definite "save your money."  I have been reading these authors since the 1950s, and I can't imagine a worse set of choices 
 A bit disappointing, in that it was supposed  to be of the same vain as 'The Matrix'. Cir- cuitry Man, with Vernon Wells, filmed in 1989  and released in 1990, beat this type of Sci-Fi  film to the punch. C.M./P.R:C.M. II does much more with less - as in less budget. Reeves should have instead done 'Point Break II'!! 
 Beautiful women, I'm sure in my teen yeras and early early twenties this cauld have excited me, But all of the "Peach" DVD productions that I've seen are the same and none rate high with me. Just seeing a Gal strip that is just a OK stripper after you've been around the world with many women, these don't excite a seasoned guy much 
 I loved the first 'Jack Frost'.  However, the sequal is not worth seeing unless you can see it on cable and every other channel on your television is blocked out and your DVD and VCR players are both broke 
 I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't.  The setting and the culture is very exotic but the story itself is very weak and uninteresting.  The characters are all one-dimensional and their motivations are not explored; it is hard to care about them or to feel that you are really a part of their world.  The plot moves very, very slowly and it is easy to get bogged down and bored in the endless narration.  The Arabic names are pretty but are hard to keep straight, especially when very few characters have any defining attributes that will help a reader remember them.  I can't recommend it 
 this product is not worth its high cost.  The bubbles in the water gauge is a hassle--I have to "burp" it with almost every pot.  The spring on the filter basket spout broke almost immediately.  I also have to agree that the coffee is not very hot.  I have used this for 18 months or so.  This product needs work 
 This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings. It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it. 
 The link remover is too flimsy to work.  I can't even say it works poorly.  One of the two tweezers is missing.  The case is nice 
 This is Zodiac Speaking: The author Robert Graysmith has it all wrong. I am not Arthur Leigh Allen.   If you like true crime novels, pass on this one as it does'nt cut the mustard. The author has made up his mind that a man named Arthur Leigh Allen is the infamous Zodiac. What you will not find in "Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Exclusive Serial Killer" are the true facts that clear Allen as the killer. Fingerprints do not match, DNA does not match, handwriting does not match. Thumbs down on this poorly concieved book 
 I WAS GIVEN A COPY OF THIS SHOW ,AND WAS HURT TO SEE THE SHOW PUT IN A BACK YARD SETTING,WHICH IS HOW SOME FESTIVALS ARE DONE. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF PLAYING WITH THESE CATS A FEW TIMES,ON PERCUSSIONS,AND VOCALS. I HAVE TO SAY THIS DVD DOES THEM NO GOOD! I WOULD ALMOST BELIEVE THEY DO NOT KNOW THIS PRODUCT OF THEM IS OUT. I REALLY BELIEVE THIS.IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THEM IN PERSON,DO SO.THERE ARE  DIFFERENT MUSICIANS ,WHICH IF YOU PLAY,KNOW COULD MAKE ,OR BREAK YOU,IN THIS CASE IT BROKE!SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS 
 This book is mostly hype. The writing is not that great. Japan must be really dying out if the country of some of the world's great literary giants can award such a prize for such weak work. However the book has erotic energy and is fresh in that way. If you are a serious reader skip this book. 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 I read this book right after Norman Maclean's A River Runs Through It.  Let us look at the substance first. I applaud the author for many things. Among them, for not trying to stretch the amazingly thin plot over any more than 130 pages, which it takes comfortably. Second, for insinuating but not conferring the name of Sherlock Holmes on the old detective. To have flirted with accident but avoided a direct/dangerous hit has, I suspect, left the driver as well as the pedestrians healthy enough. I have hope that they will each continue on their journey with very little scarring and an unimpaired memory of their favorite detective.     As for style, for all those interested, I recommend both of Norman Maclean's books for a lesson on the exact meaning of brevity. True brevity  simply reduces the vehicle which carries the power of the story. Infact, the power becomes all the more starker for it. Poorly executed brevity cuts out power proportional to the removed verbage. Such is the case here. To all authors, taught and aiming brevity, I plead, in reducing the weight of the overcoat, do not lose the wool. Keep it warm and keep it alive.   The vocabulary is solid enough but feels like pepper sprinkled over a spoonful of cold, cold pasta. The words being, individually, pretty much the only admirable things, the novel is the highbrow pulling the lowbrow into its own world rather than walking over to the latter.  
 I only caught the 2nd half of this movie on tv last night so can't comment on the movie as a whole except to say that I am no fan of ludicrous caper movies.  But I must point out that the scene near the end where Julia Roberts runs up to George Clooney as he's being led away by the cops is totally stolen from the final scene of "Green Card" (Andie McCowell & Gerard Depardieu) and it's not done nearly as well, either.  Don't want anyone to think that got past me 
 The first time I did this video I was in pain for three days. Each time I exercised to this video it got easier, but I don't have fun. I have nowhere to put the "fanny lifter" steps that I didn't realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table. If I could do it over I wouldn't buy this product, however, you will get an excellent workout. If you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video. (There is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video. 
 Unfortunately, my experience with this product is less than stellar.  For one, I am a very hairy man.  A VERY HAIRY MAN.  The look was completely different from the picture.  Secondly, upon closer inspection of the product pictured, it appears that the model has a SOCK stuffed in the front!  That must be what they mean by super sock.  Anyway, when I crammed my package in there, it looked a prairie dog popping up out of its hole.  Lastly, watch out for the string...it gets stinky 
 This book is a waste of money. Very disappointing 
 The only thing that could possibly justify the word "modern" in the title of this book is that, at the very end, it includes a discussion of supergravity and string theory. Apart from that, both the choice of topics and their treatment are fairly standard. The book is not an "introduction" either; it touches upon quite involved issues in a rather casual way. At the same time, it is sloppy both in its presentation and its notation, and some of the "proofs" leave much to be desired. It reads like something that was written in a hurry, at the expense of clarity and coherence. If one is looking for an introduction, there are far better books around. More advanced readers will be able to find books that cover the same material in a much better way, in the same number of pages 
 I would never read a book with a picture of the author on the cover 
 Although I enjoyed the story itself, this deluxe edition really didn't do anything for me. The book is 9.5 x 13 which makes it awkward to handle, hard to read and difficult to store. Fernando Duval did the illustrations and are alright at best. Supposed to be limited to 1000 copies. The book is autographed by Duval but not numbered. Not that it would make any difference. Overpriced, stick to the regular hardbound edition unless you are into odd-sized books. 
 Jim Hightower needs to quit stabbing people in the back. That is not how you solve America's problems. Another piece of pure fiction from a Michael Moore wannabee.  
 I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing.  What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy.  This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter 
 +++++  This book (first published in 1934) contains brief writings of physicist Albert Einstein (1879 to 1955), one of the most creative intellects of the twentieth century.  It contains articles (speeches, letters, statements, etc.) from early in his career.    This book gives a personal portrait of the man behind the scientific legend.   The book itself is divided into four parts:   (1) The world as I see it (about 30 articles).  This is my favorite part.  (2) Politics and pacifism (almost 20 articles).  Einstein was a pacifist (one who opposes the use of force under any circumstances).  (3) Germany (3 articles).  Einstein was born in Ulm, Wurttemberg, Germany.  (He later emigrated to the United States in late 1932.)  (4) The Jews (just over 10 articles).  Einstein was Jewish.  Finally, if this book is so good, then why did I give it the rating I did?  Two reasons.  First, there is a much more comprehensive book that also has gathered Einstein's writings.  It is called "Ideas and Opinions" (first published in 1954 and sold by Amazon).  It contains almost all the articles (it excludes seven) contained in "The World as I See It."   As well, it contains selected articles from other publications (most notably the books "Out of my Later Years" and "Mein Weltbild.")  As well, the book "Ideas and Opinions" has a fifth part called `Contributions to Science' (which contains almost 20 articles).  Here, Einstein discusses topics such as relativity, theoretical physics, science, and gravitation.  He even gives tributes to such people as Isaac Newton and Copernicus.  Second, this book's price.  It costs $9.20 and you get 65 articles.  But the hardcopy version of "Ideas and Opinions" costs about $6.00 and you get 120 articles (almost double the amount)!!  (Note that all prices quoted are as of May 2006.)   In conclusion, instead of this book, I recommend the more comprehensive and cheaper book called "Ideas and Opinions."  In my opinion, this recommended book is the definitive collection if Albert Einstein's popular writings!!!  +++++ 
 After trying to teach Access to my students with this badly written book I had to give up. I must agree with other reviewers. The book does not come close to explaning the very basics of database management in the right order of ideas. Too bad that Microsoft does not care to review their books before they go to press 
 From the Director of Death in Venice and the Leopard, comes an appalling mess of a film. While it has visual style, superb looking actors and directorial flourish, it simply goes way over the top. Martin - the personification of evil - is both a child molestor and mother fixated as well as being a transvestite.   In the Leopard, Visconti weaved history and cinema together. In the Damned, he creates a parody of that work. The Nazis were one of the great scourges of the twentieth century and 50 million people died to destroy them.   Visconti had a great idea of witnessing the Nazi's rise through a Krupp style family, but he simply lapses into poor taste and high camp too often.   
 If you want to know the God who is crazy about you...loves you so much He sent His Son to die for you...order "TrueFaced" instead.  This is NewAge fluff, none of it jives with the Bible 
 It is so strange for a famous actor like Stallone to play as bad as Stowe; may be it is competition between them to make you exhausted of watching this film. This boring story is about a bodyguard, which has been repeated in different films many times. The worst is the director who could not manage the film. After 15 minutes it made me sleep. I regret for the money that I paid for the DVD 
 The alarms works great. The radio and CD has a decent sound. Unfortunately, I needed a clock. The display can only be read when you are looking at it dead on. If you look at it from any angle, the display is washed in blue and cannot be read at all 
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 OK, so this is the 2nd Philosophy product that I've tried and felt the need to write a review on. I have to say, this product is far below expectations. I sprayed in on, and the only thing you smell is the alcohol. There seems to be no other notes to it, even after you let it settle, all you can pick up is alcohol. Definitely not recommending this product. 
 I want my two hours back.  This film struggles to find an audience.  I cannot imagine that it will inspire anyone to join the military (at least the fictional one it portrays!).  Furthermore, it's message is utterly ambiguous- much less than what the veiwer deserves for putting up with its boorish crassness.  Skip this one 
 I bought this sunscreen with high hopes. However despite following instructions to a T and not allowing it close to my eyes, my eyes immediately started stinging, and my skin started burning. Trying to wash it off was very difficult. My eyes stung for over 24 hours. I am going to return this product 
 Walpola Rahula's book is simply put, Theravada dogma which pushes the belief that the Buddha taught natthatta, namely, there is no self.  Rahula makes a number of claims about what the Buddha taught which have no basis in original Buddhism.  For example, Rahula gives a confusing account of the Five Aggregates (Pali, khandhas).  He omits any serious discussion of why the Buddha does not identify his own self with the Five Aggregates or why the Buddha always deprecates the Five Aggregates declaring them, for example, to be the Buddhist devil, Mara the Evil One.  It never seems to dawn on Rahula that the Buddha, in his many discourses, is deploying the via negativa (Grk. apophasis) with regard to the Five Aggregates.  The Buddha is really saying that our true self is other than these illusory Five Aggregates; and that we should have a revulsion towards them instead of the self!  This book deserves careful scrutiny.  And let the beginner beware, this book draws a terribly nihilistic conclusion about Buddhism.  It is ironic to note that three months before the Buddha dies he said the following: "My life is fully ripe, my life is at an end, I shall depart from you, I have made a refuge for the self. 
 If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect:  a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs.  In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality.  Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly.  By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending.  DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods 
 If you pick up a mystery at the grocery store, you don't expect Hemingway.  Or even Russ Francis.  But this is really just like a bad novelization of a middling episode of "Law and Order CI".  The good men are all craggy and strong and sensitive to women.  The women are all good unless they're hookers or junkies.  All of them, at some point, beat up or kill a man.  The bad men had bad experiences with their mothers. Wives are more successful than their husbands, who are as petulant as a teenager with a used Chevrolet.  In all fairness, there is a decent plot, but it has petechial hemorrhage from the ligature of Dr-Phil-level psychology and daytime-drama characters.  The least you expect from a cheap mystery is that it will be better than the average police-procedural tv show.  This one fails the test.  Save your $5 and watch reruns of Bones or NCIS 
 the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways 
 I purchased both this title and "The Insider's Guide to Real Estate Investing Loopholes" (same authors).  I have two primary complaints.  The authors talk down to the reader, constantly making snarky comments that imply that if one doesn't act NOW, the reader is lazy, or paralyzed, or is somehow inept when it comes to business.  That's not just annoying -- it's weird, and it made me suspicious of the authors' motives.  That brings me to my second complaint.  The book lacks balance.  I'm not saying that all of the strategies can't work -- just that it requires an ideal set of market conditions for them to work.  We need to see low or declining interest rates, quickly rising tenant incomes, improving neighborhoods, distressed or at least disinterested sellers, few other investors, low insurance costs, and a plethora of service providers (such as roofers) who do great work at a low price very quickly.  I can tell you that we don't have any of those factors at work now.  What we do have, at least in areas like mine, where appreciation has outpaced incomes, is a market turned on its head.  Sellers will not sell because they are sitting on huge profits for the most part, and don't have to sell.  Or, they believe that prices will appreciate at the same ridiculous rate that they did from 2001-2005.  Numerous Dolf-inspired investors have flooded the market and bid prices up beyond all reason.  Workers are in debt and don't have much money for rent.  Neighborhoods where deals are affordable aren't improving, so the idea of refinancing because you painted and put up a new mailbox won't help you.  Easy mortgage money has gotten anyone with a pulse into homes.  Interest rates are rising, not falling.  Insurance is costly and the coverage stinks.  And most importantly, rents do not provide positive cash flow for most small real estate investors.  I know several who actually consider themselves to be successful and the news is not good.  They are carrying their properties, their properties are not carrying them!  I know, it's hard to believe that this is success.  But in the past few years, appreciation has bailed them out.  Put that kind of leverage into effect and you are leveraging a negative, which only means you go broke faster.  A few observations:  First, if making untold riches were this simple and this obvious, then so many people would attempt to do so that it would suck the potential profit from such deals down until the actual profit is more equivalent to the amount of work involved.  (More about this in a moment -- because I believe that this is actually occuring in part due to all of the real estate evangelism going on.)  As they say on Wall Street:  "When enough people find the key to the market, someone changes the lock!"  I believe that most people reading this review are smart enough to know that markets are dynamic.  Outrageous profits bring in a flood of new entrants, dramatically reducing the profit potential.  If a whole bunch of new wannabe real estate tycoons start lining up to bid on properties, then the prices for those properties will rise, as will the price for the money (the financing charges in the form of interest rates).  Even without a lot of new entrants, if enough people start using the same financial techniques of leverage, cost-benefit analysis, or tax strategies, then the advantages to be gained will be reduced commensurately.  Common sense and basic real-world economics dictate that costs will rise and potential profits will fall.  And so it is in the real estate world.  Economies of scale and technological advancements have changed many industries and wiped out others.  The ability for a small business person to get a competitive bid on anything is severely limited, whether you are talking about insurance, waste collection, land, communication services, landscaping, or anything else.  Big players have the advantage in negotiations and will consistently be able to lower their costs below that a single investor.  They can offer their tenants more amenities and constantly remodel and update their units at a far lower cost than you or me.  I can't start a profitable shipbuilding company or TV network, nor can I jump into owning large buidings over which I can spread my costs enough to justify what is increasingly becoming break-even or negative cash flow from tenants.  I am not saying that there will never again be opportunities for small real estate investors to use leverage and tax advantages to make decent money.  Just that, with so many of your fellow investors looking to do the same thing, you are not going to find (DEEP BREATH HERE!): underpriced positive cash-flowing properties in undervalued neighborhoods with great potential on which you can quickly close at a dynamite interest rate that result in quickly-rented units with stable, high-earning tenants who are happy to stick around so you can quickly refinance at "massively increased property valuation" (Dolf's expression) so you can pay yourself and your investors back, raise rents even higher and go on to the next property with similar ideal parameters, plunk 10% down and do the same thing.  And no, I'm not an unmotivated individual who works harder than I have to, doesn't understand the value of money, or doesn't want financial freedom.  We all want that.  In Dolf's world, there are numerous individuals who can't wait to to sell you $100 for $50.  My question is, if he knows how to get people to do that, why he is telling us about it?  I think we all know the answer to this question.  Don't get me wrong:  Eventually, the property marketplace will right itself and investment properties will come up that offer opportunity to even small investors, even with the odds stacked against you.  However, it won't unlock some kind of magical door to riches.  It will simply be one of many investments that helps you build LONG-TERM wealth.  Real estate is just another business that goes through cycles and isn't necessarily any more of a path to fabulous riches than owning a chain of gas stations or making molded plastic products.  By the way, the most successful real estate investment firms in America have had a total return about 23% annually for the past five years through March 31, 2006.  That includes dividends and share price appreciation.  If that's the BEST they can do, (and I'm not saying it's bad...it's actually an amazing performance!), it's  because that's the BEST anyone can hope to do, including you and me.  Remember, these firms use all the leverage they can muster and have tremendous economies of scale, and the smartest tax accountants and attorneys working on their behalf.  We are highly unlikely to see this performance repeated in real estate for the next five years or possibly, ever.  Footnote:  I recently studied single family homes in Broward County and Palm Beach County, Florida.  Over the past thirty-five years, not including taxes of any kind, residential properties have enjoyed an average annual return of 9.25% per year.  Short-run performance tends to regress towards the mean.  Therefore, we are virtually assured that real estate will come nowhere close to its recent performance over the next several years, particularly in a higher-interest rate environment with lots of new supply.  Buyer beware 
 I've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. So, those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. And speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o.  Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you, so you go and find a "nice girl" because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with a "bad girl" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the "bad girl" because she's a slut, so you go back to the "good girl." But she's not nasty enough for you, so then...around and around we go. Women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us.  He's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Maybe Ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.   What's the music like? Well I'll give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What's Your Fantasy. That's it.  Addendum: 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I'm "wasting' my time giving Ludacris negative reviews. Well, first of all, if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it, everything on Amazon would have 5 stars, which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality.   Secondly, I don't like Ludacris. I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender more respect; but he doesn't. My diatribe above shows what my problem with him is, and I feel that argument is valid. There's no way to critique Ludacris' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women. Why should I like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us? I'm biased against him because he's biased against me. So he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e 
 Hush is a shallow and blatant 'monster mash' of characters disguising itself as an epic. culminate Batman story. Everything from Lee's generic and derivative character re-imagings (like what you'd expect to find in something produced by Image comics) to the plot. And by plot, I mean the tiringly episodic reintroduction of a character followed by quick battle and then 'on to the next one', sequence that only stops at the unveiling of a new, non compelling villain. In other words, if you're into mainstream american comics, you'll love this. If you want a real Batman story, Check out "Long Halloween," Alan Moore's "Killing Joke", Frank Miller's 'Dark Knight Returns" and Neil Gaiman's "Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth 
 My opinion of this album has nothing to do with being a "blues purist" as other reviewers have posited. It's a simple matter of good music vs. horrible music. Electric Mud is horrible music. It was intended as a fusion of Chicago blues and late 60s psychedelia, but it manages to mangle both genres equally. It doesn't help that Muddy's vocals sound disinterested and at times confused (as if he's subconsciously asking "How the hell did I get myself into THIS?"), or that the mix makes him sound like he's being recorded from a phone booth three miles away.  If Electric Mud has any value, it's as an object lesson in just how embarrassingly horrid a great artist and great songs can be made to sound. Not only would I never recommend that anyone spend their money on it, but if someone tries to give you a free copy, tell them no thanks 
 I ordered this product from amazon.com and when it arrived I fully charged the batteries.  When I went to use them they were dead.  I charged them again and when I went to use them a few days later the batteries were dead again! I want my money back 
 I am only in my 20's but I did grow up listening to the original album of A Chorus Line (my mom used to play it while we were cleaning) and I gotta say that this remake is awful.  The original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah.  I don't recomend this at all.  If you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and I know that you will enjoy it much better 
 More time could have been spent in Ney York City for this movie. Like with Friday The 13th Part Seven: The New Blood, all of the good gore scenes were cut out. But still, this is a terrible movie and I am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five 
 This book was a real disappointment to me.  Unlike "The Table Saw" book by Kelly Mehler, which is great - this router book is poorly written, poorly organized, and poorly illustrated.  If you're looking for a book to explain router basics, this isn't it.  The book appears to be a collection of rather advanced articles written for a woodworking magazine, cobbled together (poorly) with a few intro chapters slapped on the front.  After the lousy intro chapters, for example, the next one is on how to build your own router bit case.  A nice little advanced project for the experienced woodworker, but hardly an appropriate "first project."  The first half of The Table Saw book, in contrast,  very clearly explains and shows you how to set up the full variety of basic cuts, and discusses the pros and cons of the techniques.  Not this one, it'll leave you totally guessing.  While I may not be a veteran woodworker, I know a good how-to book when I see one, and how valuable one can be if done at least reasonably well.  This book fails on all counts 
 If you look at the first except page, T.S. Eliot's last name is misspelled.  Hollywood supposedly demands that every spec script be free of misspelled words and bad grammar, yet I've seen shooting scripts with "He could care less" instead of "He couldn't care less" (not dialogue, mind you) and frequent misspellings.  Much like the literary agent industry, professionalism is demanded (agent name, book proposal, nice paper, SASE), but often not reciprocated (e.g., they'll send you a photocopied form letter [Dear Author . . .]).    What we need to see are published versions of original speculation scripts.  Shane Black's first release of "Lethal Weapon" would be more beneficial a read than these shooting scripts.    Sorry, got off on a rant.  It's not that these shooting scripts aren't worth reading for new screenwriters, but there's a market out there for actual spec script versions.  If your spec has as many SUPERs in it as this shooting script, Hollywood might throw your stuff in the bin . . . unless you're established, of course 
 I found the cover deceiving.  I thought the book would be filled with fun designs and better instruction for the home baker attempting to improve their presentation skills.  I was also not happy with the icing recipes I tried.  I do not recommend this book 
 The movie Psycho is more entertaining and credible than this collage of repressed memories and reincarnation fabrication.  If you start reading the book, make sure to bail out as soon as Baby appears.  The second half of the book bears a striking similarity to the Seinfeld episode in which George fakes an arm twitch.  George's doctor correctly diagnoses George's problem as a mere fabrication, and notes that someone who goes to such effort to fake a medical problem must be a very sick person indeed.  A more appropriate title for the book might have been "A Fabricated Mind".  A couple of high/low-lights of the book:  ï¿½	Bob's pathetic attempts to establish that he is not just your everyday crazy Joe six-pack.  He is at pains to underscore that his mail-order doctorate was achieved in record time.  His claims regarding unrealized archery potential qualifies him to the league of could-have-been Olympic champions if not for...[insert pathetic excuse].  ï¿½	Despite Bob's claimed close association with George H W Bush, the only tangible link between the two seems to be Bush's acknowledgement that he never read an earlier book authored by Oxnam.  I am hoping for Bush's sake that he exercises the same restraint regarding this book.  At least Bush had the common sense not to permit his name to be used in the author's acknowledgements.  I am not surprised that Bush (and other notables including Warren Buffett) have had no association whatsoever with the author since publication of this book.  
 In most of the articles Kun has written, he goes on about his upbringing as a "rich kid in LA." I keep reading in various articles the same nostalgic patter about bar mitzvahs and being into records as if no one else in the world was, and more about being rich and a "disaffected Jew". They are strangely the same autobiographical stories, told over and over and over again, and so mundane and boring you wonder what the fuss is about, and what he's so proud of with this, and why he thinks we should view them as anything beyond the dull world of an over-indulged child of priviledge. True to form, the book starts out with this AGAIN! After his usual first person ramble on the subject (the reason why is unclear.. since often it has nothing to do with the subject matter being covered), he then goes on--  rambles on-- about the subject of "American music" (I think) -- switching to a opaque academic "professorial" voice, veering into various declarations about "race."   His "opinions" on race-- particularly Mexican and African-American (I'm talking about the poor societies therein, not the priveledged tier)-- too often come across through a foggy lens, not by someone who has a clear vision of and experience with the issue (why he impresses the fact that he lives in a glass house and then tries to get us to believe that he "really gets" the world of ghettos and poverty is beyond me). His attitude toward the world of the new Jewish immigrant in America is often insulting and strange, particularly in the way he mocks this group. This, and other rants, only impresses the fact that a boy in an ivory tower attempting a hipper-than-thou stance has little true understanding of the subjects he writes about. Beyond this turn off, there are other problems. This is a very poorly constructed book, and very tiring. The subject matter is far above the tiresome presentation and the quality of writing. Wish someone else had tackled the subject, and by a more outstanding press (but perhaps it was turned down by the bigger houses) 
 With all respect to Mr. Hawking - this book should never been published. I'm not blaming him, but all others who are responsible it went to market.  Let me explain a little bit  Most of buyers of this book, are buying based on Hawking reputation from "Brief history of time" (which is excellent book). What we have here - pictures which doesn't have any relation with text (at least not valuable and are far to big - taking space in other words, you'll not buy book of 60 pages for 35 USD), changing from one subject to another, explaining the basic things somebody who is reading such a book should already know (spin - 2 pages) and then jumping to complicated things (M-theory - mentioned in 1 row) without explanation. Some jokes and comments I don't understand.  I bought this book 6 months age and came to approx 1/3 of book (poker between Hawking, Newton and I think Einstein). I didn't have nerves to read more ... this is first book in my life I didn't finish.  I never thought I'll write review, especially not like this and especially not for book of Mr. Hawking, but I felt cheated. There are so many other excellent books on same thematic, try them, forget this one.  But anyway, my 3 year old son was extremely happy by disintegrating this book to more then 1000 small pages ... lucky him.   
 Be forwarned, this book merely reprint articles from past (and some may say ancient) issues of Model Railroader magazine.  An expert model-railroader could probably create some of them, however, for a novice this provides little more than ideas for layouts.  Also, many of the plans are for HO and N scale, with very few O scale layouts.    Overall, I'd say there are better layout books out there for you to spend your money on 
 We all know the saying, when you assume you make an (butt) out of you and me. Ronald Steel wrote a book about assumptions, which is bad enough. He tries to use the legend of RFK to predict vitality as a President and a man. However, he is unable to stay focused enough to present his case until the last nine pages.   Except for the last nine pages, the book is a very concise biography of Kennedy with a derogatory slant. Steel is critical of JFK's Presidency, making the suggestion that he would have been a forgettable president had he not been assassinated first. While Bay of Pigs was a failure, I suppose the Cuban Missle Crisis was unimportant in American history. Avoiding nuclear war is not important to Mr. Steel. The book suggests the legendary status JFK was exulted to was the only reason we even know of RFK. Steel goes on to suggest that Robert Kennedy was obsessed with his brother in the year following JFK's assassination. I suspect Mr. Steel would suggest Robert should be over his brother's death in a week's time. I would like to send Mr. Steel a copy of the Kubler-Ross's Stages of Dying.  My favorite assumption by Steel is that the primary reason RFK ran for President was because he wanted to be JFK. He makes Robert out to be like an obsessive stalker. Is it possible that RFK felt he had something to give the country as President? Or maybe he had something to prove being in his brother's shadow for so long?  The last nine pages, where Steel explains his thesis, is servicable for toilet paper. What is your vendetta against RFK, Mr. Steel? Robert Kennedy may not have won the nomination of his party, but RFK's very campaign stance is proclaimed hypocritical. Having apparently not cared for African-American rights during his tenure as attorney general, it is suggested that he only campaigned on the issue to get the votes. The portrayal of good Bobby/bad Bobby split personality is simplistic and inaccurate way for some to label Bobby coming out of his brother's shadow. He could not win, he was either mourning too long or trying too hard to establish his own identity. RFK encompassed the hopes of many Americans and had ideas to change America. He never had the opportunity to prove himself. Maybe he is not worthy of the legendary status he has gained in American history. However, people do change and can emerge with new priorities in their lives. I would hope Ronald Steel changes his career. 
 This book has no coherent structure, but is a conglomeration of tips.  Many of the coding examples use fairly complex SQL without explaining it.  The join section is laughably short.  It is probably most useful for someone already experienced in SQL who can read through it to pull out "tips".  I have been away from SQL for a few years and wanted to brush up and this absolutely was not the book to buy.  What a waste of money 
 After loving Halloween 2, and it's creepy hospital setting, I was very excited to hear that there were two other hospital-slashers in the early 80's; this and "Hospital Massacre". I hadn't been able to find these two movies until I went to this video store out of town that is known for having a HUGE selection, as well as a lot of hard-to-find movies. I was very pleased to not only find "Visiting Hours" and "Hospital Massacre", but a whole other bunch of scary movies I wanted to see. I got "Sleepaway Camp 2", and then decided to get only one hospital movie; I chose "Visiting Hours" due to the supieror cover art. Well, it's no Halloween 2. In fact, it's not even a slasher movie!; it's purely a drama, laced with thriller/suspense elements. And it's boring, boring, boring...One other problem is that alot of the movie foucuses on the killers personal life. We see him talk and act in his "normal" life. This not only made it more boring, but it made it so the guy wasn't even so scary anymore! The hospital setting is not that creepy even, and the parts in the hospital that are soppoused to be suspensful and scary don't happen till towards the end. Other Notes: "Visiting Hours" was actually based off a book, which is now out of print. And most horror films based off books aren't always all that exciting. This isn't...Lastly, this is a very "mature" kind of horror film; it isn't something you'd watch on Halloween with a group of freinds, and doesn't have the thrills and chills of "Halloween 2" or the fun of the "Friday the 13th" series. And don't be fooled by the cool box art 
 This album is musically no worse than a lot of the Top-40 fare one typically finds on the radio.  What sets it apart from the pack is the vocal contortions of Rob Thomas.  This guy's gutteral croakings and alternate whinings -- which some have described as "heartfelt" -- will almost induce vomiting.  Self pity has never been so wretchedly on display as on this grossly over-played CD.  Avoid at all costs!  
 I don't understand the appeal of this book.   I've been around the internet phenomenon in one form or another for almost 20 years. I'm conversant with the history of many technical and cultural happenings on it. As a result, I'm probably not the best reader for an 'shocking truths' book because none of it is going to shock me.   I read this book thinking I might come across a few clever tactics I'd not heard of, and because it has been marketed as cynical and funny writing. We had a copy of Rube Goldberg's Steal This Book in the house when I was young, so I was hoping for something in that vein too.  Honestly, I struck out on all three. There wasn't anything new for me, which was fine. I didn't find the humor lame or bad. As a matter of fact, I simply didn't find it. Am I not reading it right? And finally, the irreverent I was looking forward to...well, I'm not entirely sure it's possible in this context. The book didn't deliver that premise for me, but I'm not sure it can really be done anymore. That time and those circumstances in our culture are different from this time and these circumstances.  Someone who is idly curious about how the internet "really works," likes a long read, and can get into being entertained on the topic might enjoy this book.  For me however it was flatly informative, sometimes a little forced, and simply not a funny piece of writing 
 I bought this video for my four year old son because he's a Spider-man fanatic.  Little did I know that this series is not meant for children.  When we started to watch with him, I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I flipped the box over to find the rating (never dreaming there was one since I bought this in a toy store right next to a stack of Teletubbie videos!)  There is a PGV rating on the back for violence but they don't tell you about the adult language as well as the sexual references.  Needless to say we shut it off and tried to distract him with a more appropriate video for his age.  I don't know if I'd let my 16 year old watch this 
 Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this book. Buy the XML Bible instead. It is much clearer, deeper, and nicer to read 
 Most of the information in this book is common sense. Saying that all pregnancies are different and that juggling two (or more) kids is a challenge isn't exactly earth shattering news. Very few of the subjects in this book are really explored in depth. I agree with the reviewer who said this book is like something you'd expect from a magazine. It hits on several good topics but doesn't really say a lot about any of them. I got more out of re-reading the books I had with my first pregnancy. This book felt like a waste of time. I don't really think it's worth the money 
 I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows.  I'm not, so I couldn't tell you.  Mediocre at best.  "This is Spinal Tap" was better 
 I was so excited when I signed this book out from the local library. I read through it with such enthusiasm and excitement and couldn't wait to start applying some of the Ayurvedic principles to my already whole foods diet. Well, my enthusiasm started to fade, then flicker when I started preparing her recipes. The recipes looked good on paper, but the finished product was bland in flavor and lacking in depth. Her overzealous approach of ghee, sugar, white flour and salt floored me. I will not even begin to list the host of medical problems that may ensue if this book was cooked from on a regular basis. Does a cookie recipe really need 2 cups of sugar? Must all of her bread and cookie recipes use white flour? Why not use more whole and natural foods - brown rice syrup for sweetener, spelt flour for the white flour, etc. I tried so hard to make this book work for me (I have tried over thirty recipes), but to no avail. Thankfully, I am not letting this book undermine my new found passion in Ayurveda. I will be looking elsewhere for inspiration for an Ayurvedic diet

 I was as big of Elvis fan as there ever was,but, he's gone, I miss him and this was a really bad idea. It looked pathetic to see all these old (but talented) geezers, up there performing with a forever young Elvis. Not only that, but they changed some of the licks they played too. Wonder how Elvis would have liked that. Elvis as a performer was always great, even if he just stood there. But, the best way to see him is in original concert films. Course that's just my opinion. I miss him 
 My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie 
 This book is lame.  It's black and white drawings are sloppy and they don't instruct.   There is little or no instructions This book is way over priced.  Stay away from it 
 Evidently, this book does not target people starting out in Public Relations. I am a VP of Marketing in a start-up company looking to get some feel for the value of PR. I found this book utterly unintelligible. I was also irritated by the constant reference to `clarity of communication' - advice that the author clearly ignores. Why is `plain English' considered to be such a crime? After reading this on a 3 hour flight from Denver to New York, I was none the wiser about PR and given the significant weight of the book, decided to leave it on the plane. This is a text for PR academics 
 I am an IUI/IVF patient and was looking for more extensive information about the process. What a disappointment this book was. I found the technical information to be simplistic, even condescending. There was nothing in this book that I hadn't already learned from previous reading or high school bio. Example: "These are your ovaries and how they work"! In fact, the list of medications is out of date; it didn't even include meds that I have been taking, and offered little or no practical advice on finding discount pharmacies, etc. Furthermore, the constant emphasis on the "total insanity" of fertility was annoying. I have certainly been stressed in the course of treatments, but I am not going through "total insanity"! -- when it gets to be too much, we just take a month off and then start again. This book seems to have been written for people who have ZERO coping skills. For instance, the advice they offer on marital/sexual issues is basically: Communicate. Duh! Finally, I found the obsessive trashing of women who exercise "too much" to be ridiculous. Their fitness advice: only "walking is okay" and "get fat". In fact, they recommend that women trying to conceive enjoy just letting themselves get fat, with no mention that being physically fit helps prepare us for pregnancy and labor. They assume that being fit means being underweight. For women who are physically active, this book offers no moderate or helpful advice about balancing healthy weight gain with stretching or toning exercises, only insulting rants. 
 To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988"  HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!     Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around.  1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.     Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948.  The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system.  Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course)     It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began.    2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years."  Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.  Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly.  Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!      
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 This book is about as clear as 12 inches of lead when it comes to explaining concepts.  The author spends half of the text on digression bordering on preaching.  Variables are introduced with vague explanations as a rule.  There are tons of equations in this book with little or no explanation.  Terms are regularly defined and then used differently then previously defined.  The organization makes it of absolutely no use as a reference.  If you must buy this book for college, make sure it is in good saleable condition when you're done because keeping it would be stupid 
 This movie stinks and I saw The Godfather Part III which on amazon says got three stars.  Whell I thought it was three stars to many.  PS:Amazon you need to put a zero rating we can choose from because now I am mad at my self for giving this movie one star 
 The editor provides a wide selection of essays on the subject of the potential growth of American labor in the United States without substantiating any real insurgency.  While hindsight is always 20-20, we now see that labor has declined since the publication of this book, perhaps the book's optimism and lack of critical analysis is its major weakness.  The labor movement cannot rely on empty phrases.  The writers are drawn from well known new left academics and labor leaders that optimistically predict a rosy future for a new revitalization of the American labor movement.  Unfortunately, the editor takes for granted the writers' assertions that are unsubstantiated without a critical analysis.  Labor has clearly changed from the cold war era.  However, no nuance is detected here, given that exhortation does not bring about revival nor does it make it true that organized labor has emerged from its past bureaucratic and territorial character.  The book is interesting, but larded with hubris and hopeful expectations.  More helpful would be a prospective assessment of labor's problems.  If readers are interested in what labor intellecuals were thinking in the aftermath of Sweeney's rise to power, this book provides interesting commentary.  To understand how a new labor movement is constructed, the editor and authors must understand how capital remakes labor. 
 I purchased this book on the recomendation of a friend.  I found it useless.   It is poorly organized, lacks useful maps and is not well indexed.  It fails to provide any context.  We traveled with friends who had the "The Ultimate Kauai Guidebook: Kauai Revealed", and that is the book to have.  BTW, the free hawaiian music CD that comes with the underground guide is very good 
 With the exception of some pages that have been added in the back on braided rope this book is horribly outdated.  The newer section is just reprints from Sampson rope splices which are available on the web.  Unless you are restoring an old square masted sailing craft don't bother 
 ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)      ((( Insert this every other sentence! )))     figuring out the problem is not hard, its admitting it.     ( hint, dont kneejerk and yell hate and sexist, this is a woman writing, who stays home with the kids and whose own mom stayed home with the kids, rem those days?  the 60's?  oh gee why has everything changed?!  you know the answer, just admit it.      A sense of community  We know all about the women who live along Wisteria Lane, but not what's going on with the people who live on our own street. We instant message with strangers around the world while hardly talking to the neighbor next door. We know the middle names of celebrity children, though we have no idea who the kid across the street is.   It's the American way, or perhaps the demise of the American way.   Fewer people know their neighbors, a decline that's been occurring since the late 1960s, according to the book "Better Together: Restoring the American Community," (Simon & Schuster, $15, 336 pages) by Robert Putnam and Lewis Feldstein.   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     Since that time, social clubs, civic associations, participation in public affairs and time spent with family, friends and neighbors have all dropped by 25 percent to 50 percent, according to the book.   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     And the average American has friends over to dinner about 45 percent less than in the 1970s, according to another of Putnam's books, "Bowling Alone" (Simon & Schuster, $16 paperback, 554 pages).   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     "It does seem to be the kind of thing we have lodged in the collective imagination where the Cleaver family has barbecues with the neighbors," says Kevin Wehr, an assistant professor of sociology at California State University, Sacramento. "That just seems to be not really the case anymore."   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     Busy schedules, a more transient society all contribute to declining neighborliness, experts have found.   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     
 In reading Girlfriend in a Coma it struck me that it was Coupland's attempt to find meaning in life. The ending of Girlfriend in a Coma was a disappointment and Coupland never seems to have recovered. All families are psychotic, but this book is so fanciful that it lacks the power to invoke feelings of reality. The power of Coupland's early books was in their ability for people to see themselves as GenX or as Microserfs (although this lacked something). All Families is three parts slapstick ridiculousness and one part hyperbolic soap opera family.  Douglas, if you're reading this - keep looking for truth, because you have settled for mediocrity just like the characters in this book 
      For those of you who have sincerely been seeking the truth about the Holocaust, who have done your homework and read a variety of sources and opinions, this book may well push you completely over into the revisionist ("deniers") camp, as it did me.         Deborah Lipstadt is an Emory University professor of Jewish Religion, NOT history.  She was evidently supported by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in writing this book; they hold the copyright, not her.  Denying the Holocaust is an attempt to respond to Arthur Butz and others who have raised major factual objections to the usual "6 million Jews killed in gas chambers" version of WW II.         Arthur Butz gathered a wealth of research material in his book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century.  Ms Lipstadt responds to his scholarship with things such as name calling, twisted logic, half truths, appeals to emotions, failure to produce evidence, failure to define terms, omitting things, assigning bad motives, answering a question with another question, using big words, etc.  That is why I call her book, Denying the Holocaust, a Holocaust Liar's Handbook.  I value my copy as a wonderful exercise book for seeing through sophistocated lies.        
 This film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave. I originally saw it for free and afterwards, I still felt screwed. It stank so badly that I checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre. Yeah, I know. Call me "Mister Tact".  A "horror-comedy" that's neither slightly funny nor remotely scary, this film is a supposed sequel to the 1981 horror classic "An American Werewolf in London", (which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made). The filmakers had a lot to live up to and, boy, they blew it in every department. The effects were ludicrous, the cast was lost, the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues, and the director should have been shot (with something other than lots of narcotics). This film is a textbook example of the Hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew.  If you have already been suckered into buying this DVD, I feel your pain. You are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a Heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack 
 Did not enjoy the book format of the book. Why? It tries to achieve too much. Combining Self-help Content on Pop Finance, and a Novel inside on Wealth Hunting.  The point sizes of the words inside the book are terribly small (paperback!). I found the reading experience filled with ideas jumping around.  Read " Learn to Earn" is much much better 
 It started with a great title, and an interesting subject. In fact, i already started reading it agreeing with the author. However, this book is terrible. It is unbelievably repetative, and the arguments are amazingly bad. If this book was redone using some solid thinking, it would be awesome. We won't change anyone's mind until you write arguments above a junior high level. I would recomment looking for other authors. I went into this book with high expectations, and was very disapointed. In fact, it pushed me more over to the other side as I read it, just because i was so taken aback by the garbage that was being put forth as argument and evidence. There just has to be a higher standard than this. If a student wrote it, i would give it a D. 
 I've been on a reading streak where I've been reading pretty much any book I can get my hands on. This book nearly killed it. The writing was awful and the characters were horrible. I felt really bad for Matthew Rettenmund's thesaurus because I'm sure it was mangled by the time he got through with writing this book. The book was full of unrealistic dialouge and painfully unwitty and unfunny observations. The main character was frustratingly arrogant and unbearable. My only motivation to finish this book was to write a bad review of it here and move on to other, better books. People need to be warned 
 This movie is watchable, but barely. Its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions....and see leatherface as a....never mind, youll have to see for yourselves. We have a yound Renee Zellweger in this one.  
 The real disaster is that this movie was ever released. The premise was not credible, the characters two-dimensional, the plot predictable, the dialog childish, and the avalanche scenes repetitive.  Waste of time 
 A few months after reading and thoroughly enjoying Hey Nostradamus, I picked this book up, thinking that it would be good. Okay, I can  see why the book might appeal to some.. it raises a lot of questions that young adolescents often ask themselves about life while struggluing to find a true identity, making the reader feel like they relate to what the narrators(as there are six in the book) have to say. But come on, what is this book even about? It seems to be full of pointless ramblings of worried and depressed characters (all seemingly sharing the same personality) that don't even establish anything. Nothing is accomplished as these narrators babble, and it seems that each character is right back where they started at the end of each story, or else the story seems incomplete somehow. Some things that are said in the book do make the reader think or laugh because they know that they've asked those same questions to themselves, but in the end... this book has no plot and is quite a waste of time 
 This book is horrible and chocked full of slanted thinking (?) and outrght lies aimed at dividing this country even further. It's a sad, sad day when this is what American politics have become 
 David Moody has written a hyper-realistic apocalyptic zombie survival thriller - not simply a knock off text of popular zombie movies, but a strongly character driven book.  Three Characters who are so obtuse and dull, and written in the same first person voice as to be indistinguishable from either each other or the 3rd party intermittent narrator.  Virtually nothing happens in this book - sure most of humanity is wiped out, and eventually rises in mass - but readers know how that goes; getting a hyper realistic look into the psyche of three nearly identical characters isn't that interesting - and certainly doesn't warrant 200 pages.   Maybe as an American reader I expect more from both my zombie thriller and its protagonists, than several trips to the grocery store, lots of soup being consumed, and one brief chapter of massed zombies at the barricades 
 I had to use this book because it was required for the physiology course I took, and the test questions were taken from it.  However, it is the most sloppy textbook I have ever dealt with.  It is so cryptical and convoluted, it actually makes the material HARDER to learn.   (For example, bizarre acronyms are introduced in the answers to sample problems that are never even been discussed in the text itself.)  The different sections of the book refer you back and forth to one another without explaining anything in a basic way.  In addition, the index is terrible, so you can't even try to dope things out on your own.  I would advise you to not get this book if you can avoid it, especially if you are a student trying to learn this material for the first time 
 Oh man... this book was absolutely terrible. I was expecting to learn a little bit about the lives of homeless people-- you know-- all of the suffering that they endure etc., etc. Instead, what you get here is a story about a homeless man and how he works for a newspaper. He goes on and on discussing his position at the newspaper and never really elaborates on anything else. At first, I couldn't put the book down. I was patiently waiting for some intriguing stories about life as a homeless man. Then I decided to put the book down about 3/4 of the way through. I gave up. Boring, boring, boring. This book will cure anyone's insomnia-- it put me to sleep- that's for sure. ZZZzzzzzz.... 
  Nothing hear, just the same aimless blabbing and complaining about how the streets currupted a young man. Whoa, if i could only make a song about my messed up childhood and make billions, I would be richer than these wannabe softees out int the hip hop scene. 
 I bought and read this book and found it to be a superficial treatment of the subject for Christians who believe in a single God, which I am not.  I finished the book hoping for a deeper understanding of guilt and forgiveness after experiencing the recent suicide of my only child, a seventeen year old boy suffering from severe depression.  I am sure this book will be comforting for those it is written for but it did not shed any light on the subject for me 
 ONLY REASON I'M RATING THIS IS BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE A RATING,ONLY REASON.....ALL I WILL TELL YOU W/O GOING INTO DETAIL ABOUT THIS DVD..."DON'T BUY IT"....IF YOU DO YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED...VERY DISAPPOINTED 
 I was disappointed by this book.  While generally sympathetic to its conclusions, I was expecting a systematic examination of exactly what the title purported to promise, namely, "How the American Media Sell Wars..."  Instead what I got was a broad hodge-podge of sweeping statements that oftentimes read like a blog post -- of over two hundred pages.  The authors seem to realize this when at the conclusion of the critical 2nd Chapter titled "The Crisis in Journalism", they write:  "We concede that this has been a sweeping discussion of journalism, and we have had to use broad brush strokes.  We believe our core argument survives more detailed examination, and it would certainly be qualified and enriched by more detail and nuance." (p.35)  This level of examination doesn't stop them in the very next chapter from "drawing upon the foundation laid in chapter 2" as if sweeping assertions in one chapter could support sweeping assertions in the next without ever having to come back down to planet earth to have a closer look.  The book is completely riddled with un-sourced and undocumented conclusions which you either agree with or not but which the authors simply announce without bothering to prove.  The situation in newsrooms "is not unlike the newsroom in Pravda or Tass in the old Soviet Union" (p.32).  Media coverage of Colin Powell's speech at the UN "could not have been exceeded by Stalin's stooges" (p.59).  While all of this sounds great, you're entitled to wonder in a book that places so much emphasis on journalistic standards what exactly the authors know about Pravda, Tass or "Stalin's stooges".  In sum, this isn't a book that's particularly strong from a journalistic or research standpoint.  The conclusions might make you happy but you're none the wiser as to the reasons why.  The fact that magazines like The Nation, In These Times or Mother Jones haven't reviewed it also isn't a good sign.  My copy is going straight into the trash 
 don't get me wrong, i love david byrne too.  but david bowman may  have been better off just f***ing him and getting it over with.  this book is pretty well written, if poorly edited, but is so laughably skewed to make david byrne appear to be an infallable and ethereal genius and to make the other members of the band look like absolute monsters.  the author obviously hates tina weymouth and can't include a single quote from her without interpreting it to mean that she's untalented, stupid, bitter, spiteful, and jealous.  he can't include a single quote from david byrne without explaining that if he comes off as a little rough, it's just because he's misunderstood (and a genius, and handsome, and creative).  i enjoyed reading this book but didn't take any of it seriously.  david byrne is clearly the creative force behind the talking heads, but bowman is basically a talking heads denier-- he doesn't even believe anyone else was in the band besides byrne 
 While I only am a little over half way through this book, I'm finding myself hating Will.  He's pathetic and boring and not at all a character that I can cheer for.  This book has been a tedious read overall.  I keep pushing through because I feel like it has to get better, yet so far it has not.  I'm happy that I checked this out from the library, so that I can return it and not have it collect dust on MY shelves.  The only reason why I'm even writing a review is that I'm so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far.  I looked on Amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others; I'm surprised that they are not.  I usually like this genre of fiction, but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self-loathing 
 I'm baffled by the glowing reviews posted by PW, Booklist, and my fellow amazon readers.  This book is nowhere near the quality of earlier Francis efforts (see Whip Hand, Forfeit, Come to Grief, Enquiry).  As a couple of other reviewers have noted, familiar characters--Jenny, the Admiral, Archie Kirk, Jenny's new husband--have undergone complete personality transplants.  Wonderful characters from previous books now come off as weak and foolish (or bitchy in the case of Jenny & Anthony).  Even Sid has lost his magic.    Rigorous editing would have helped, and surely Francis deserves Putnam's best.  But in this book, the usual spare and effective dialogue has turned clunky ("I've got to make a phone call," I said to the policeman.  "Now!  It's urgent!"), awkward ways of passing information to the reader abound (several sentences of dialogue begin "As you know ...", and at one point an asst trainer gives _Sid_ an explanation on the importance of not smoking in a stable!!!), and portions of the plot are weak (see the thoroughly inexplicable behavior of villain in ch. 19).   But, honestly:  I'll keep reading these books as long as Francis keeps publishing them.  (There are strong passages and elements here, in addition to the problems I mention above.)  Here's hoping we see a return to form in the next effort.  And many, many thanks for the dozens of fabulous novels that came before 
 Don't let the cover fool you, this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like "Groove", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway. Now I wouldn't call this bad, it had it's good parts, just not many. 
 This book started well, but fell flat in the middle. What little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through. Even the shooting incident couldn't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly.  Well, I didn't bother to finish it--I have limited time for reading, and I don't like to waste it.  
 Myself, my peers, and my teaching assistant for my math class equally agree that this book isn't that great.  Topics have few examples, if none at all, and can be hard to follow. It only has one color ink, black; and with all the text so close together with nearly the same font and size it's hard to find key equations from previous chapters.  This may be the best book out there for advanced calculus, but it desperately needs to be revised and reorganized 
 I had to read this book for school this week. The first 20 - 30 pages were very slow and boring. In the end, the book was a slight more interesting. I would not recommend this book to my peers. I did not enjoy reading A Gathering of Days.  Some of my ideas of how the author could have made this book less boring: 1. Added more suspenseful climaxes 2. Taken out unimportant information 3. Wrote this book in regular format, not journal format 4. Used better word choices throughout the context of the book 
 I don't know what's up with all of these 4-5 star reviews. This movie was awful. There was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag. Not even the guest appearances by Afrika Bambataa, Melle Mel, and the Rock Steady Crew could save it. I couldn't wait for it to be over with. The "graffiti" throughout the movie was absolutely awful. Ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair. Guy Davis was fine back then, but not anymore. Rae Dawn Chong was just annoying. This is one movie I never want to see again 
 Lucie Arnaz herself said this book is full of false statements.The information is wrong and way off. There is a picture in there that says "Lucy trying to make it in New York, in early modeling days", and it shows a woman with no top on. Lucie Arnaz said that it is not Lucy, it doesn't even look like her. If Lucille Ball could see that she would be very embarrassed. If you want learn about the true life of Lucille Ball read Love,Lucy the one and only autobiography of Lucille Ball told straight from her heart 
 Well this is coming from a big crue head, and all I can say is if you are a really big crue fan that wants to collect all the crues albums get this one.  But if not, and your a new fan looking for a greatest hits collection, please! go for Red White and Crue, it has way more songs only for a little more.  Besides this disc is missing some of the most essential tracks from the crue like Live Wire and All in the name of..., Anarchy In the U.K., Piece of your action, Too Young to fall in love, and without you. Besides Red White and Crue has all of the missing tracks of this disc, and 90 percent of the good new songs of this cd 
 I found The Whole Woman more antagonistic and needlessly controversial than enlightening. Greer makes it quite clear that there is exactly one feminist left on the planet, and she is it.  I'm hard-pressed to think of any third-wave feminists who live up to her standards. To do so, you would have to be an earth-mother living in a separatist commune with her lesbian lover. There's nothing wrong with that lifestyle, but it's not one to which most feminists would aspire. It's not one to which I aspire.  Also, it's as limiting a construction of womanhood as the patriarchal one she deplores. What do you do if you are heterosexual? It's all very well for her to say that you can reconstruct yourself as a lesbian, but that's as insulting as the implication that homosexuals just need to try hard enough and they can be heterosexual.   In a similar vein, I found her views of men particularly unpleasant. She suggests in no uncertain terms that they're all potential adulterers, rapists, child-abusers, wife-beaters, misogynists, etc . . . etc . . ., and that any woman who wants an equal, non-exploitative relationship had better become a lesbian. It's hard to see it as anything but pure slander, backed up by the flimsiest of anecdotal evidence. Just because you can cite a few cases of sickos who get turned on by their baby daughters in their nightgowns does not mean that all fathers will inevitably turn to abuse.   The rest of the book is no better. It's very poorly researched and argued, and parts of it verge into the insane. She seems particularly taken with the idea of "primitive" women as whole women, because they aren't bound by Western concepts of femininity. What she doesn't mention is that those women experience the same oppression that Western feminists fought long and hard to overcome. They might not wear bras or high-heels, but that doesn't make them any less oppressed by patriarchy. It seems obvious to me that women from tribal societies do not generally have much real political power, but are doomed to bear lots of children and die young. When she does look at the appalling aspects of those societies, she puts a positive spin on them. There's even a section where she seems to defend female genital mutilation.   Also, I can imagine that some of her ill-informed views are extremely offensive to people in those situations. She describes IVF as patriarchal appropriation of and interference into the process of reproduction. Similarly, she suggests that women who don't opt for natural childbirth (without anaesthetic, of course) are allowing men to remove them from the process. It's utterly disrespectful of the choices women may choose to make, not because they've internalised their oppression but because inseminating themselves with a turkey-baster seems vaguely ludicrous or because they don't want to experience agonising pain.  It's been a while since I read a feminist book that made me angry and this one does so for all the wrong reasons. It makes me embarrassed to call myself a feminist. 
 design of book is very poor--pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story.  The translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex 
 This book is disappointing for Red Sox fans, and I would assume of little interest to non Red Sox fans who are tired of having the Sox shoved down their throats since October '04.  Considering Mnookin had his own desk at Fenway and all of this supposed insider access to the team, there is little to no new information here for those who have followed the Red Sox closely.  If you read the Globe and/or the Herald during this time period and followed the team, there really isn't anything new here.  Mnookin also spends several chapters telling the history of the Red Sox.  If you're a Sox fan, you've heard all of this a hundred times before.  In many ways this book reads as advertising for the Red Sox (look at the book's title).  The only person Mnookin really criticizes harshly is Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy, who he paints as a modern day Max Mercy.  While this may well be the case, it's hardly new information, many Boston fans dislike/distrust Shaughnessy already.  It's pretty easy to go after a guy most people don't like anyway.  It's always interesting to read about the Sox, but you might want to rent this from the local library rather than buy it.  You've read this all before 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 The book is great but though I was charged for the shipping and handling , still I recieved the book in a bad shape and I did not complain because my last purchase was the same and I/my account/reputation with the custmer service  would have looked bad. But generally the book is great and I recommend it for every body but try to ship it to the US address and let somebody bring it to you as it will save you money and you will have an undamaged book which you could sell it in the future 
 Not only is Diamonds Are Forever the worst Connery Bond film, it is probably only surpassed by Moonraker as the worst of all of the 007 movies made by EON films.  A story that is far too complicated for anyone to keep track of what is going on, and relying too much on the return of Sean Connery as Bond left the producters and director to create a parody of their own films.  After On Her Majesty's Secret Service did not give as good an initial return on their investment, evidently producers Saltzman and Broccoli decided to take a step back in the direction of You Only Live Twice and Thunderball, but even further back than those 2 films!  The result is a complete mess, with a Bond movie that would have probably suited Roger Moore quite nicely, but is a shame to see Sean Connery wasted on such drivel. The one saving grace of this, the 7th James Bond movie, is the pre-credit sequence where Bond is hunting for the head of SPECTRE, Blofeld, who is responsible for killing his wife Tracy in the previous film.  To sum it all up: Ernst Stavro Blofeld in drag.  Need I say more 
 If you are an academic involved with the field of social movements, you need to read this book, simply because so much of the current debate in the field is about it. If you are not such a person, don't bother. Dynamics of Contention is immensely disappointing. Within the field of social movement studies, the authors are supposed to be the equivalent of Olympic-level divers--but what they deliver is a spectacular bellyflop. I give the book two stars because the core ideas lying behind it are good. The authors want to break down the artificial academic barriers separating various fields that all deal with "contentious politics"--social movements, revolutions, ethnic conflict, etc. They also want to move beyond their own structurally oriented work, so central to the academic field of social movements, to try to incorporate the ideas of their cultural constructionist critics, plus introduce more of a focus on social relations. Instead of trying to create an invariant model, they want to search for patterns that recurr in widely different types of social conflicts, with different outcomes. Finally, their methodology of comparing unlike cases to find the common patterns is intriguing. Unfortunately, they never really develop a solid intellectual framework for all this. They identify some common patterns, but never explain the dynamics underlying them or why they are so common. They are rather inept in their attempts to bring culture into the picture, engaging in very thin description. In their attempt to create a more relational approach, they completely abandonn all the valuable structurally oriented work they've done. Finally, despite their attempt to focus on relationships and dynamic social actors, human agency--as in so much academic work on social movements--falls out of the picture. Although the authors obviously put a lot of work into this book, it just does not come together 
 As much as I liked the pictures and the possibilities of the gardens, there's no chance that the average person could even attempt some of the Japanese style gardens.  The designs are beautiful but you really do need a LOT of room to do any of these designs.  The idea of a calming, tranquil space to sit would be wonderful but not on my budget 
 Granted, there are few books available on the subject matter. This book is a classic example of saying in 14 chapters what could have been said in seven. The subject matter is dated ,and the concepts well beyond what is actually used to staff the majority of organizations in this country. To imagine that formulas will be used in most companies to project vacancies, demonstrates how far removed the authors are from the "real world".... 
 I like Bose products.  I also think they are a good company, overall.  But these phones are simply mediocre in sonics.  Put them on, and they sound good enough.  But, they are inefficient and give the impression of clarity via softness.  They do not compare to $25 Philips SHE9500s sonically.  The Philips are incredible once you get the right sized ear bud on (of course, the same goes for the Bose--it is ESSENTIAL to "find the bud for you," or you'll never see the merits to in-ear phones).  If you don't think that finding the right sized bud is important, try (carefully) using in-ears WITHOUT any buds on and you'll get tinny nothingness.  You can tell the difference between these two makes by hooking them up via a large headphone adapter to a regular stereo system.  NO COMPARISON, the Philips are truly PREMIUM at c.$25 against the near $100 you serve up for the Bose.  Again, these phones are GOOD.  At $25 they'd be a fair value--even so at just under $50;  still, they would not be as good as the Philips SHE9500s.  At nearly $100, the Bose are overpriced and, in my opinion, you are paying for all the TV advertising they do.  If you have money to burn, you can't go TOO wrong with the Bose--but you CAN do better.  TWO STARS because they do work.  But since I now have five pairs of Philips SHE9500s, I doubt I will ever use the Bose again.  They are not a value.  For that, look to the Philips SHE9500s 
 I found the text to be poorly proofread.  Some of the examples in the text did not tie to the information given.  I found the examples hard to follow and the explanations vague.  I expected a lot more from Mr. Kaplan 
 In this fast world of ours, I just wanted to be able to make a code-breaker, but NO!! I tlked to the guy on the hotline, and he treated me like ****! 
 As I read this book, When Madeline Was Young, I felt as though I was lost, wandering through a forest, searching for something - a beautiful butterfly, a perfect flower, a mystical cottage.  But there's nothing there.  It's just a forest full of a confusing tangle of leaves and vines and nothing mystical at all. And that's how this book is written.  It is a tangle of thoughts and words, spread from the first page to the last.  Nothing special at all.    I've read all of Jane Hamilton's books.  I loved The Book of Ruth.  Adored A Map of the World.  They were both wonderful and I will always have positive comments for them, but I doubt I will ever buy another book by Ms. Hamilton.  It's not that I want a "formula" book.  But I do want to read something that I can relate to and I don't relate to this at all.    I don't like Mac, the narrator.  His mother is just plain strange and not endearing or believable at all.  I can't stand Buddy, his cousin.  The rest of the characters I barely know and, quite frankly, don't want to get to know.  Perhaps I've changed since her first book came out.  Perhaps the author has.  But whatever the differences, my love of Jane Hamilton's books has ended.  Sadly 
 It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I  gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through 
 The quality and content was not worth the money spent. A couple of guys with a regular CAMCORDER driving around Rio and shooting video of the local attaraction without real professional input.  Will not buy anything from these guys again 
 A very lackluster effort.  Sophomoric lyrics and for the most part had nothing to distinguish itself.  I liked the title track a lot, and a couple of other ballad type songs, but the rest was poorly done and little imagination 
 This book 4 Days in Eternity, by Wayne Marentette was OK at best. I highly recommend Psychic Gifts by Tiffany Snow ISBN number 0972962301, if you are seeking a book with "Substance" that goes much deeper. 4 Days seemed like an eternity when I was reading it, drags on 
 This book can be described as a history book for the historians for the simple fact that it has too much information for the regular reader. The book reads more like a text book then anything. The author will mention name after name, but without giving proper introduction of who the people are, leaving the reader lost unless they know their history to a great length. The book also has some shortcomings on how much of it is about harlem, rather it is about the leaders of the Harlem Renaissance. As the preface mentions the book could have been subtitled (or titled) Civil Rights by copywrite. This would have been a more fitting title for the author focuses more on the great literature at the time and its authors then anything else. While the book has a ton of facts, and an indepth look into many works, I failed to gain much insight into the events that the book is writing about 
 A bunch of junk.  Not any of the really meaty excersises.  An excuse for the auhor to make money 
 Although this book is recommended by some homeschooling programs as a history text, I found it to be unacceptable because of its extreme anti-Catholic bias, reminiscent of Foxe's Book of Martyrs 
 This book is putting me to sleep! I bought it a few days ago and have spent that ENTIRE time reading. I'm more of a visual learner, usually the TYI21D books are very hands-on. So far, this one is harshly hands-off! How can I be expected to remember all this information? I need examples, not just charts. It doesn't look like its going to get any better later in the text, I've scanned-through the book several times wondering when this terribly detailed nonsense will end and from what I've seen, it continues through the entire book. -yawn 
 I purchased the Adaptation soundtrack thinking the song from the trailer and the V.W. commercial would be on it. The soundtrack is nothing more than very horrible sounds, nothing from the trailer and very expensive. False advertising at it's best 
 I listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong. Her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce. Billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra. Fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang. You make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless. The one good thing about billie is that there is alot of her music to chosse from before you buy this 
 I've only read the first 70 pages or so, but agree with others that this is repetitious.  You better love the ACC, because it's mostly about those teams.  And UCLA.  And the errors.  Clearly the author was trying to churn out two books at once (the other being on the NFL Ravens), and it shows.  1) Coach Krybaby is "his" introduction says Scott May broke his leg at Indiana, and that cost them the national championship in 1975.  And K was an assistant to Bobby Knight.  Well, actually May broke his arm against Purdue in February 1975.  Arm, leg, what's the difference, right????  2) Author says Michigan State beat Penn by 32 in the 1979 semis.  Actually it was 34 points (101-67). And Penn had beaten UNC earlier.  And UNC had beaten MSU by 1 early in the regular season when Magic Johnson (as Dean Smith points out in the book) had eight turnovers.  That's all well and good, but the latter game also was infamous for when one of the Tar Heel radio guys said, "Magic Johnson is no Phil Ford."  And MSU fans couldn't agree more.  Ain't THAT the truth!!!  All in all, this book is highly disappointing.  A slap-dash effort at best. 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 I'm already somewhat intuitive, I get the gut feelings, chills, sick feeling when the thing being guessed about is negative, the sense that something is just wrong, or I'll have something come to me that won't make sense but will later on. These things are mentioned in this book, and for that I'm glad, as it will clarify what intuition means in that sense. However I feel the book may lead those less knowledgable of what intuition is and what it feels like and what it's good for to some wrong conclusions. The book goes down the road of new age beliefs rather than practical uses for intuition, the whole "you create your reality" stuff which does not have much to do with intuition. Intuition is that feeling that you "just know," creating your reality is what you focus all your thoughts on all the time and how your life forms around those. Not the same thing! Also it talks a LOT about doing 'readings' and about psychic stuff, leading one to believe that intuition is focused on others and on the far future, and I've found this to not be true at all. Intuition does not have to be premonitions or asking someone a bazillion questions to pull info out of them until they tell you what they want to believe.   Also, the exercises, Exercise 4 claims to be you using your intuition to make answers to a bunch of phrases, such as "a man's name." However, I've found that the list, my answers which I did not give much thought to, were not some random intuitive message, they were in fact many of my favorites. It asks you to choose a color...most people will be tempted to put down their favorite color, not some magical psychic message that has some huge meaning behind it. The book also asks you to take all your very abstract random responses to questions asked in the book and then apply them to a question of yours that is not even remotely related to those random responses you had, and to make up a response that foretells the future for that question. It's just like asking a magic 8 ball a question and getting a response. You know the answer and question don't actually go together.   It is unfortunate that this book is on the market, leading people to wrong ideas about what intuition is, how to use it, and what it can do for you. There are too many new age-y books that rely on quick thoughtless exercises that claim that everything all fits together in the large universe so everything MUST have meaning, however, think of this: if everything had meaning, even the shape of your bowel movement must have meaning, or the sounds your shoes make on the pavement have some magnificient meaning. That's what this book wants you to believe. It has nothing to do with intuition, it is disguised spiritual b.s 
 I was expecting this to be a book about the monastic experience, but instead, it is a book mostly about Kathleen Norris, her life, and her social theories. There are a few nuggets of wisdom sprinkled here and there, but not enough to justify reading all the surrounding dross. Worse, there is no humility in the book at all.   Instead of being a seeker of wisdom who went into religion and then wrote about her experience, Norris seems to be merely a writer with a gimmick of hanging out with monks and nuns to get a good book idea. If you like that sort of thing, you may like this book, but you should know what you're getting before you buy it.  There is a hard edge to Norris's writing, an underlying anger and vulgarity. For example: "[N]ow we sigh, discouraged, hearing only the seeds of our well-worn, ludicrous sexual double standard which dictates that women must be either virgins or whores, either blessed or cursed, while men are simply sexual athletes." And: "That we all begin inside a woman and must emerge from her body is something that the male theologians of the world's religions have yet to forgive us for."   She uses the f-word, apparently just to shock readers and listeners, as when she notes with self-congratulatory satisfaction that after one such use her driver appeared startled because "[S]he apparently had heard that I was a religious writer." Well, regrettably, I had heard that, too.   There is far too little introspection in this book. Norris too easily criticizes others while failing to look at herself and while rationalizing her own behavior. Perhaps I have been spoiled by reading Henri Nouwen, who seemed to always analyze the nature of his own feelings instead of criticizing someone else who may have brought those feelings about. But then again, Nouwen was a person of admirable humility, a quality Norris needs to work hard to develop.  Norris has plenty of personal issues to deal with, as do we all. This book would have been much better if she had spent more time honestly wrestling with these issues instead of commenting on externals, offering social criticism and justifying her life as "a poet.

 The product was easy to install but there was a trick I noticed. A day after installing the software I ran full scan. To try the sincerity of the software, I downloaded  same free trial. To my chagrin I was told my computer has about 420 problems and could only fix about 15. My question now is are all these gimmicks 
 What do Lenny Kravitz, Craig David, Derek Jeter, Hale Berry, Barak Obama, Rain Pryor, Keanu Reeves, and The Rock all have in common? They're successfull bi-racial Americans of politics, arts, and athletics. Unfortunately, Rebecca Walker Leventhal doesn't measure up. She feels sorry for herself because she's half-white, and she's angry at her father for making her half-Jewish. Poor thing.  Leventhal's life is nowhere near as bad as she wants us to believe. Her father cared about her very much, and her stepmom sounds okay to me, but she writes about her father like he was neglectful. She's angry at him for moving the family to a suburb, but was that such a bad thing? What's wrong with wanting to live in a good area with great schools? She felt alienated from her white Jewish friends, but that was self-imposed. All these Jewish people WANTED to be her friend, but the suburbs just weren't good enough for her.  Her next complaint is her teen years. She acts like it was all pain and guilt, but from what I read, she had a great time. She had lots of interesting boyfriends, and spent a summer on the set of "The Color Purple." She graduated from high school, went to an Ivy League college, and that doesn't sound bad.  Walker's problem is her MOTHER. Alice Walker was a terrible parent. What kind of mother refuses to take her daugher to meet her principal? What kind of mother refuses to be involved in her daughter's life. I think the reason   she complains so much is that she's realy angry at her mother, but seems guilty accusing her. After all, Alice Walker is black, and she can't accuse her black mother of anything. Her Jewish father is an easier target.  Leventhal (or Walker, whatever she calls herself) should stop thinking of herself as a victim and a mutant, and start thinking of herself as the product of two wonderful things. Lenny Kravitz  was another Black Jewish American, and he had his lumps, including his parents' divorce. But being Black and Jewish didn't hold him back, it kept him going. Rain Pryor was a Black jew, and her dad was a cokehead, but she writes about her life with strength and humor.   At first I didn't think Rebecca had the wisdom commonly associated with American Jews. But then I realized she's one of us. How do I know? Her whining! Read "Born to Kvetch" and you'll learn why Jews are stereotyped as whiners. We're very vocal about things, including our problems. It's one of the ways that we avoid stress and anger, which in other cultures leads to drunkness, temper flashes and wife-beating. But we do other things besides complain, and that's all she does. Complain 
 Need I say more than the above title suggests? Okay, so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience. There are some touching moments in this book, but even then there is still something the author is lacking. I saw the movie when it was in theatres and I have just finished reading the book. I liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book. The movie was funny, entertaining, touching, personal, and sad at times. The book did not captivate me at all. I had trouble staying focused. Considering Beverly Donofrio's credentials--a bachelor's degree in English from Wesleyan University and a master of fine arts in creative writing--her quality of writing is very poor. Her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education, if even that. And not to go off topic, but since Donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like Columbia U, then why doesn't she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life? I mean, after all, the MFA is in creative writing, meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time. She has only wrote 2 books--Riding in Cars With Boys, and Looking For Mary, both about her getting pregnant at a young age. If you liked the movie, just leave it at that. Don't bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed. And if you're interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy, then go to the local library. Don't get this one. There's other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one.  
 Levine repeats the most obvious, readily available information in a superficial attempt to somehow "prove" what any Civil War historian worth a penny knows - that the Confederate government did not officially approve Black enlistment until March, 1865.  What he does not address is what was actually taking place in the field.  Black Confederates in combat appear in the Federal Official Records, Northern and Southern newspapers, the letters and diaries of Union and Confederate soldiers, the Slave Narratives, books by and about the United States Colored Troops, and newspapers of the 20th C:  Elgin (Illinois) Daily Courier-News, Monday, April 12, 1948 - "Robert (Uncle Bob) Wilson, Negro veteran of the Confederate army who observed his 112th birthday last January 13, died early yesterday morning in the veterans' hospital at the Elgin State hospital...He enlisted as a private in Company H of the 16th regiment of Virginia Infantry on Oct. 9, 1862 and discharged May 31, 1863."   The Project Manager of the National Park Service African-American History Web Project commented (June 20, 2005),"While some free African Americans served in the Confederate army, their role is not as well documented and preserved.  In addition, many African Americans who served in some capacity in the Confederate army, often anonymously, were slaves."  How is it that Levine is not aware that the Federal government recognizes the existence and service of Black Confederates?  Levine's book is yet another proof that anyone willing to support and tow the "company line" can find a major publisher, but anyone who wants to do more than scratch the surfac on potentially controversial topics is limited to small private printings.  Incidentally, in February, 1861, the South was offered the 13th (Corwin) Amendment which would have permanently protected slavery in America (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwin_amendment).  This did not motivate the South to return to the Union.    In December, 1862, Lincoln offered a plan of graduated, compensated emancipation which would have perpetuated slavery until 1900 - that did not motivate the South to return to the Union.   The South did not secede to protect slavery and the Union - with its Union slave states protected by the Emancipation Proclamation - remained a slave nation until December, 1865, some eight months after the Confederacy ceased to exist.  Levine is just another so-called "scholar" whose commission is to support the edited, expurgated, abridged, and thoroughly rewritten "history" of the Civil War.  This was predicted all too clearly in January, 1864, by Irish-born Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne:  "Every man should endeavor to understand the meaning of subjugation before it is too late...It means the history of this heroic struggle will be written by the enemy; that our youth will be trained by Northern schoolteachers; will learn from Northern school books their version of the war; will be impressed by the influences of history and education to regard our gallant dead as traitors, and our maimed veterans as fit objects for derision...The conqueror's policy is to divide the conquered into factions and stir up animosity among them... 
 I just saw the author talk about this book for nearly an hour on C-Span 2's Book TV.  He says he researched and wrote and tried to get inside the mind and career of Crockett for three years, and he talked about him for 45 minutes without ever mentioning the fact of human slavery.    Crockett was a slaveholder, and may have also been a slave trader.  In 45 minutes the author not only never mentions this, but never used the word "slave: or :slavery" nor even made indirect allusions to the topic, though it was at the center of American and Southern economic and political life during Crockett's career.  It was common back then for folks down on their luck to purchase some slaves in the East, rope them neck to neck and walk them to Mississippi or Arkansas, when that was the frontier, or in Crockett's heyday, to Texas, where they would sell for three times the value they brought at the point of purchase.  Did that have something to do with Crockett's trek to Texas?  Did he bring any with him?  We'll never know from Buddy Levy.  The secession of Texas from Mexico was largely about the fact that white Texians, as they called themselves, demanded the legalization of slavery, and the right to legally hunt down and return escapees from Arkansas and Louisiana.  On Book TV, Levy talked for forty five minutes, at great length about the secession of Texas and the political climate and happenings there at the time of Crockett's death.  He spent a few minuted detailing the career of Mexican president Santa Ana too, recounting how the white settlers regarded him as a dictator, but never mentioned the dictatorial act which displeased them the most -------- his refusal to allow slavery in Texas.    At the time of the Alamo, one in five "Texians" were slaves.  Make no mistake, despite the author's apparently sanitized version of the history --- that's what Crockett and others died at the Alamo for.  Human slavery.  Based upon his Book TV show and the author's evident big blind spot, if I see his work in a library or bookstore I'll pick it up and look in the index to see if slavery gets mentioned, if there is an index at all.  But I would never buy it, and wouldn't recommend it.  Bruce Dixon Marietta G 
 Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of "Life sucks and then you die"?  What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?  AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids 
 The title is misleading. It should indicate that a great deal of other information is brought into play, such as history, politics, and propoganda. Many will, no doubt, make the case for how these add information to the main story line. I don't see how a flawed and simplistic history of early research in radiation helps tell the story of how a boy becomes interested in building a reactor. If you want to read a better and more correct history of the discovery and early work in radiation, even an encyclopedia does a better job. And the author's drive to paint nuclear energy as black as possible leads him to huge errors in his facts. What Wernher von Braun has to do with radiation, I can't begin to guess, but he was never a major in the SS. He was never an officer in any Nazi organization. Some reviewers dispute the author's aim to attack nuclear energy. It's very telling that one of his oft quoted sources, "Nukespeak" was published by the Sierra Club and written by a trio who have made it public that their aim is to be sure this country turns permanently away from this energy source. The author's significant mistakes are enough to discredit this book on their own merit, or lack of.  I feel a need to also address his characterization of David and other geeks. Especially in lack of a mentor or proper guidance with potentially lethal equipment, an enthusiastic student shouldn't be run down by adults. That, as much as any other event in David's life, helped push him further into the hole he was digging, withdrawing from possible assistance, and causing David to adopt a suspicious and sarcastic attitude toward adults. That's a certain recipe for the disaster that nearly was in David's life. I do know of that which I speak. My own experiments when I was younger nearly disposed of me, and the abuse I took from peers and adults only made me more determined to show them I knew what I was doing. I secreted all I did, as David began to do. We dorks may be dorks, but alienating eccentrics doesn't help them or those affected by them.  A disappointing book, one that could have risen to great heights. The bigger shame is that there is no other book on the subject that I can recommend 
 I fell in love with the "Anne of Green Gables" movies when I was a little girl because of they were such lovely interpretations of the L.M. Montgomery books. Meagan Follows IS Anne Shirley. When I found out that a third installment of the series was coming out, I could not wait. However, what I received left a very bad taste in my mouth. "Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story" was horrible! The story was terrible and did not live up to the previous installments that drew you in to the story. With this film, I really didn't care about the characters the way I had in the past. The only thing I did care about was the fact that Anne and Gil were FINALLY together, but was still disappointed by their rushed wedding - something I had been waiting for for a very long time. I don't think that we, as fans, had the opportunity to really enjoy their wedding the way we had always imagined we would. I also hated the fact that the character of Jack and his son, in a way, came between Anne and Gil. Sometimes I felt like Anne was cheating on Gil with her interactions with Jack. I wanted to see Anne and Gil have their own children and raise them in the wonderfully heartwarming way they were raised, not with all of the melodrama of WWI.  I truly wish that a better ending to an extraodinary series could have been made, but I guess I'll make do with the first two movies. I can't say enough great things about those films!   The only reason I am giving this film one star - I would like to give it zero - is because some of the original cast is back. It was great to see Anne, Gil, and Dianna once again!  If you are a fan of "Anne of Green Gables" and "Anne of Avonlea" (aka "Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel"), don't bother purchasing this last installment. Although I'm sure you will want to see what happened to all of your favorite characters, your hopes will certainly be dashed and disappointed by a poor story and poor dialogue 
 I bought this copy of Kenneth Grahame's wonderful classic because the illustrations were so lovely.  When I read the book however, I realized that this book, albeit with beautiful illustrations, was heavily abridged.  I am sorely disappointed by this, and feel it should be clearly marked in the labeling of the book 
 I hate to rain on everybody's parade, but I found this book to be a rehash of stuff I've read over and over in other places. There's too many numbers in here. What people need is an attitude about money, not just "save  so much money for so long at 10% interest per year and you'll have so much  saved for retirement at 65, but if you wait until you're 35 to start,  you'll only have this much saved...." (that's not a quote from the  book, but you can place that quote in almost any financial book, and it  will fit just fine). Personally, I thought the Millionaire Next Door was  better and Rich Dad Poor Dad in a leauge of its own. Any book on this  subject will certainly convey "some" information. The problem is  that they are too number oriented. People need to focus on paying  themselves first regularly, having a set savings program and intelligent  investments. This book seems to be more focused on getting rich by  retirement. That's just great, but anybody who saves money over 40+ years  darn well better be rich by retirement or they don't know what they are  doing. On the other hand, I think the authors are realistic in the sense  that this is not get rich quick by any means. If you want to sum it all up,  no matter who you are or what your circumstances are, save money on a  regular and consistent basis, cut up ALL of your credit cards, pay cash for  everything, keep your wants and spending under control and that's about it  really. It's not that hard to get rich. I just wish the book had more  practical information and less technical analysis with all those numbers  and statistics 
 If you suffer from physical problems similar to Ms Selak's, you will find this book useful. If you do not, you will have wasted your money buying it. I expected more than a recitation of Ms Selak's journey through her own chronic disease. There are many other chronic diseases whose progression of symptoms is quite different. This confusion could have been easily overcome by giving the book a title that indicated exactly what chronic diseases were discussed within it.   As a person with a chronic disease of an entirely different type, I am familiar with the emotional roller coaster one must travel, but my reactions were quite different from hers. No right; no wrong. What is wrong is for her to set forth her own reactions as some sort of standard for the rest of us. How sympathetic can one be toward a woman who disregards her own well being as well as the efforts put in by her fellow cast members just to fulfill an immature fantasy of being a star? Suppose she hadn't been able to control the pain with medication. Wjat would have happened to the rest of the cast who had worked so hard to put on this production? If she had the stamina to complete the grueling three-week run of the show, no wonder the insurance company had doubts about the extent of her disability. 
 If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.   Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?    It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."    A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it 
 This book contained a lot of informative statistics, but I felt that the implied thesis was that expansionism, imperialism and other forms of colonization are always bad and that nobody asked the countries conquered if they wanted to be conquered. The selection of quotes seemed bias and out of context (especially the quotes drawn from Mark Twain) 
 These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much! 
 Such an intelligent writer, but one who takes 309 pages to tell a story that could have been told in less than 100. If you're into page after page of ruminating, intellectualizing, ego-centric analyzing, you'll love this book. If you prefer a good story where the plot actually moves, then look elsewhere. Maybe I just don't get the whole New York angst thing.. 
 I was really hoping to find some great information and insight into unschooling with this book.  What I found was one woman's narrow-minded opinions about parenting.  The foundation for her strong opinions appears to be a traumatic childhood, a few 1970's books on unschooling, and the experience of raising her only child.    She is extreme and harsh in her judgments.  Nothing stated in this book is backed by any sort of data.  If you actually look up her daughter online, you will find a woman who is unsure about her radical upbringing.  The daughter does not view the experience with the same nostalgia and romance as her mother.  Needless to say, I think this book was a disaster.  If you are looking for a very extreme viewpoint on unschooling presented as one woman's memoir, than this is the book for you.  If you are looking for some genuine insight and information on unschooling, I would look elsewhere. 
 I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.  
 Samples of this CD suggested a nice mix of neo-grooves with fresh, unique vocals.  What I heard were uninteresting and predictable tracks, weak and (at times) unintelligible vocals.  Hoping to add Aya to my stable of neo-soul vocalist, e.g., Dexter, Larrieux, Badu, Scott, I found this CD better suited for the "used" sale CDs.  Another reviewer said this would make great ambient music, and that makes sense; I could put this on and forget all about it 
  The Million Dollar Baby was a bummer. I mean if like long dry stories that may put you to sleep then read this book. The only story that is filled with action and will keep you on the edge of your seats is the short story Million Dollar Baby. The only reason why that is good because it's just like the movie and the movie is great.   The Monkey Look, Black Jew , Rope Burns etc. are about 25-30 pages a peace and they don't keep you into the book as others.The Movie is the only Millin Dollar Baby anything i would waste my time on.   
 Good, flattering fit.  I'm 5'2" and I bought a short which was perfect and long enough to wear with heels, even a bit long actually.  Unfortunately when I washed them, they shrank 2" and now I have to wear them with flats.  I would buy them again, just in a longer length 
 This book has its interesting moments, but seems to be quite bland at times.  If read for school, don't become discouraged too easily.  The true meaning of the book is brought together later by the author. All in all,  the book was rather bland to me, but I'm simply one reader.  Find out for  yourself 
 Hello, my name is Joyce Carol Oates, and in every bookstore in the world, I must occupy at least two shelves for myself. JCO has never written anything of real insight in her life. She is wordy, PC, dull, and overly prolific, not because she has good ideas, but because her ideas are shallow and therefore she can use lots and lost of pages to say what good writers could do in 2 sentences. In just this year, she has published 3 books. And the year isn't over yet. This book in particular is bloated and dull. End of story. "Blonde" is a terrible PC piece of dreck claiming for 700 plus pages of very small print, how Marylin Monroe was a misunderstood brilliant genius. WOW. Let me tell you something- if you keep having to say it over and over again to yrself, maybe you'll come to believe it. Genius. Right. Right up there with Picasso and Newton and Homer and whoever else. JCO writes so much, you just want her to go away- she is desperately trying to find something to keep her name in print in 100 yrs, because she must know she don't got it and she won't last. Quantity doesn't mean quality. She is very sloppy and there isn't anything she could possibly offer on the technique of writing, other than just having diarreah of the typewriter/laptop. Don't buy this book folks. Okay, I feel better now. phew 
 I have loved this series since discovering them in the late 80's.  I think that O'Brian ranks with Austen, Twain, Forster, etc. regardless of 'genre'.  However, Simon Vance just does not do justice to this book.  I have not heard his renditions of others in this series, but if his Aubrey voice is consistent, they must all be disasters.  Aubrey sounds like one of Monty Python's Twits.  Vance also rushes descriptions that deserve much better pacing.  He also seems to miss much of the wit hidden in O'Brian's circumlocations -- or is much too subtle at conveying it.  I hate to diss working actors but....  Mr. Vance should try Wodehouse.  Bring back Tull 
 This is one of the many books, such as "Little Black Sambo" that many (white) adults have fond memories of, and most black people find deeply offensive. While many might feel that the characters could "be of any race" and that "it teaches children important lessons" and the the story is "beautiful and touching," I feel that it does perpetuate racism and stereotypes -- both overtly and in more subtle ways.  "Dar wuz dis sum pepuz who wuz settin, an dey wuz axin bawt dis mawnin, low dat dey waz tard. Dey kep runnin way fer ter fer home, sot dar wunner nudder, an de wuz gwine fas. Twel bimeby wuz atter fer ter ketch, bless grashus, hit wuz down ter dis day, an duh bimeby dey, gwineter git fer ter tell, deze yer, dish yer, an fer ter git, dey wuz dere an gun ter."  What important lesson does this teach young children? How could this apply to upper-middle income children in Marin, Westchester, or Cook Counties 
 about metal working than this terribly mis-titled book.  Read the other low rated reviews.  They cover the problems well enough.  Only thing I can figure is all the 5 star reviews are friends of the author or something.   One guy mentions how much he learns about metal shrinking.  My question is how?  It is mentioned many times.  In one place they have a photo caption saying heat shrinking works by heating a spot and then blasting with air to quick cool it.  As for mechanical shrinkers, they never tell you how they work.  Or give any info on how to figure out how much or how to really shrink metal.  You will learn it can be shrunk and pretty much nothing else.   For someone wanting to learn metal work, it isn't useless.  It is pretty close to it.  You honestly can learn more by watching some Biker Build Offs as metal is worked in the background.  I haven't been this disappointed in a book in many years. 
 I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.  
 In the introduction is a vivid description of a baby urinating upon its father.  NOT what I would want to see in a book about food.  Absolutely revolting!  That, coupled with the fact that the author couldn't be bothered to back up his often-incorrect information (to such an extreme degree that this book should be classified as fiction) makes this one worth skipping.  If you do read this book, you may want to check the "facts" against other sources before relating any stories to other people, lest they make you look like a fool when you're proven wrong.  I don't believe that this book will truly enrich someone's knowledge of food 
 Someone's trying to sabotage the making of a documentary. I thought it might be interesting. I'm sorry, I was wrong. Unfortunately, the book was downright predictable. In some areas, it was just plain contradictory. The characters lacked depth and the plot was extremely weak. When you see this book on the shelf, just keep walking 
 Although this book is a detailed, if overintellectualised, account of the Sex Pistols' short career and the ludicrous media games of Malcolm McLaren and Glitterbest, It is not by any stretch of the imagination, a book on U.K. Punk. It completely bypasses England's second generation of Punk (1981-1983)out of which sprang many of the Greatest Punk Bands Of All, such as The Exploited, Discharge, Vice Squad, Chaotic Dischord ,Disorder, The Anti-Nowhere League, Chaos U.K., G.B.H., and The Insane! None of these bands are even briefly mentioned in this book! It's As If Jon Savage,poncey journalist that he is, is afraid to acknowledge their existence! Instead he wastes page after agonizing page reading overblown hippie-like ideas into the useless New Wave bands he erroneously believes to be punk! The one or two lines about Crass don't even begin to make up for this pompous smokescreen. Worthless, Stalinist tripe!!!! Save your money and save yourself a headache! DO NOT BUY THIS!!! 
 I saw this movie about 20 years ago when it was on Cinemax. I fell asleep while watching it then. I bought the DVD as part of the Controversial Classics set, and was looking forward to seeing the parts I missed.   This time, I fell asleep twice watching it; it took a total of three nights to see it all. I found it just as talky and heavy-handed as I did when I saw it back in college. Further, I didn't pick up on any chemistry between the leads, and found James Coburn's character loud and annoying. Finally, the great MGM hairstylist Sidney Guillaroff was way off the mark on this one. Almost all of the women had mid-60's hairdo's that were distracting, particularly Miss Andrews, whose distracting poofie 'do often changed from shot to shot within the same scene.  I get it; war is bad. Nevertheless, this film did little for me. It did, however, look very nice; the DVD transfer was well done 
 Denice and I grew up in the same small town in Oklahoma. It is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death. This heinous crime not only shook Ada, but also shook those of us who grew up with her in Purcell,OK. Denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room. She was a year behind me in school. I recently pulled out a old High School annual. Looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories. Memories of a beautiful, innocent young woman who's life was ended in the twinkling of a eye. As important as it is that justice has been served in this case, it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget Denice.     
 Edward R. Murrow was a giant of a man and more than just the liberal hero of felling Sen. Joseph McCarthy (who went overboard on a very real problem of Communism in the US - see books on Venona), which takes up much of this small book.   In actuality, Murrow was a rare quality of a man that shined for a bright moment amidst much darkness. His notion of fairness and character is better addressed in A.M. Sperber's "Murrow: His Life and Times" (read p. xi and following). Although, the best contemporary view of those times - to be neutral - is now found wanting, as no one is neutral - although he was exemplar regarding fairness, even when he went to defend his associate Laurence Duggan (p. 99), who was not only a KGB informer, but in fact, a KGB agent (this wasn't known to the public until after Murrow's death). Nevertheless, Murrow was a man who stuck to his guns and his character and redefined journalism (earlier journalism had a "yellow" reputation since the 19th century). My father had worked with him in the 1950s at CBS and told us that he was down to earth and a solid person. He was the ultimate gravitas statesman of journalism. He was not so easy to categorize, which journalism since the Watergate era has done in political terms (when the media was redefined by the Bernstein / Woodward team at the Washington Post - decidedly with a left bent).  Bob Edwards, who has hosted "Morning Edition" on NPR, writes briefly on Murrow and tends to mold him in the image of a contemporary liberal media hagiography, but never really shows the depth of his character and the times that were (again, see Sperber).  In his afterward, Edwards comments on the devolution of broadcast journalism. His most telling paragraph is when he writes: "If there's a Murrow now among young journalists, he or she will probably leave the business before arriving at a position that gets our attention. If that person shares Murrow's background and training, he or she likely will end up as the president of a small college, enjoy the work, and know the names of every freshman's parents. That would be a very good thing and we should not necessarily mourn the loss of such an individual on a bigger stage" (p. 165).  Another outstanding journalist of that era to research was the Chicago-based Clifton Utley.  I still remember those great weekend days when my father would listen with memory to "Edward R. Murrow - A Reporter Remembers, Vol. 1: The War Years, 1939-1946", those London broadcast recordings of Murrow starting with the memorable line, "This is London". He would start his later broadcasts with a similar focused-styled phrasing that captured the imagination and hearts of people everywhere. 
 Although I loved For Planets and Kings, and looked forward to reading Blue River, I found it tedious and monotonous. I thought the character development was limited and I didn't feel the involvement as I did with the  character's in Canin's other book 
 Warning:  some of the songs listed on the box are abbreviated versions and should be listed as such.  They fade out half way thru the song.  I was very disapointed.   Would be much better in chronological order.  It is in some places, but then jumps around for no apparent reason.   It seems like Barry attempted to show what a talented entertainer he is, and he is very talented.  It is just this box set tries to do too many things, and accomplishes nothing.  It just tries too hard.    
 i dont understand how a 'movement of the people' cannot bring  itself to write in the language of the people. this book is so freaking boring and negative and cynical. jesus christ man.   karl, have a coke and a smile. and stop inserting french and 5 paragraphs of footnotes on every @#$@#$ page. who do  you expect to get through this mess?  
 Would love to review but have not received anything yet!  What's up wit dat? 
 Many people have mentioned the embarassing cover art to this book. I agree and it is also very misleading. The characters in the book do not even resemble those guys - the main character's love interest is an artist who looks nothing like the clean cut characters on the book jacket.  Things we can do without in gay fiction from now on:  1. A spoiled egotistical self indulgent main character. Yes this may apply to some gay guys but its just BORING now in the books.  2. A distant disapproving father and eccentric mother. YAWN  3. The flamboyant gay friend (usually black)   First this book starts as a character study - will this selfish debt ridden loser get his act together? - then it morphs into some sort of romance (never worth your time) - then has a whole chapters about the running of an escort service (fairly interesting) and ends with a kind or frenetic black humor. It never gels.  I kept waiting for the big romance and it was incredibly lame. Was my heart supposed to be warmed about him doing threesomes with his new boyfriend and a client????  If you want a real book about running and escort agency read the MAYFLOWER MADAM's book. At least it's interesting.  If you HAVE to read a book about a selfish gay man - I recommend "California Screaming" and forget this trash.  
 As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action 
 For good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years. Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films, but at the same time they'd like an anime feel to their films... what's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing, creative, and powerful. This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it isn't.  This didn't have an anime feel... which wasn't really a problem for me - I've seen a number of anime movies which were serious, but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come.   Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas (how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there?), this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them. "A Christmas Story" and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within Tokyo Godfathers.   Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation? I doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great (they were not, but that's beside the point since visuals aren't all that matters), I doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original (the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of "odd fellow" characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own... except she is a transvestite, really a man).   I feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it, but I can only guess that they haven't watched very many Christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately.  The director however is one of my favorite - I deeply enjoyed Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though I'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to "cling" onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table.   Furuya was successful in taking a bland film, creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again. The audience bought it up... too bad. You don't need to feel ashamed to say it really isn't as special as it tries to present itself as.   Oh well, perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film. Here is the film's ultra-negative review by an informed reviewer... I sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as "unhelpful" because they disagree with it (then again, that's the style on Amazon these days isn't it?) 
 This is one of those situations where you CAN jusge a book by its cover! 
 I began reading this book quite a few years ago but elected to stop after forty pages.  It is aimless, vile, and without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Be warned: this is one you'll be ashamed to put in the garage sale...if you don't decide to just set it up in flames and put it out of its misery first 
 It is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject.  The reviewers who have lamented the short, choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another, without benefit of full explanation or connection, are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book.  I had to read some paragraphs several times and even then didn't understand what I was reading.  It was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind, as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on.  The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages, which incited one yawn after another.  The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances.  For example, the narrative is littered with sentences like: "She made for the east exit..."  Okay, fine, but did she run, walk, crawl, hop, skip, jump, or fly to the east exit?  I just don't know what to picture there.  The word "made" says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen.  This type of problem occurs on every page of the book.  I haven't read anything else the author has written, so I hate to be so critical.  I wonder, however, why his editor didn't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions.  I felt as if I was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft.  I have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations.  This just isn't one of them.  Compare "The Circus Fire" to "Into Thin Air," "Heart of the Sea," "Batavia's Graveyard," or "Ordeal by Hunger" and you'll understand what I mean 
 Despite liking a couple of his movies, I've never been a fan of Preston Sturges, and a second viewing of Unfaithfully Yours did nothing to change that. With rare exceptions like Frasier or Comme une Image, most supposedly `sophisticated' comedies are usually either too clever by half or not half as clever as they think they are: this definitely falls into the latter category. It may be slightly more articulate, but it still comes down to pratfalls and clichés clumsily dispensed (not to mention an incredibly one-dimensional role for Linda Darnell as the wife whose sole reason for existence seems to be to worship her husband). Unfortunately it soon becomes apparent that despite his confidence in the early part of the film, Rex Harrison is entirely wrong for the part: aside from being so incredibly unsympathetic that he simply alienates you for most of the film, he has absolutely no facility for physical comedy, which renders what could and should have been a great comic setpiece where he accidentally trashes his hotel room far more thoroughly than any rock star ever could even dream of rather tedious and protracted. (Alfred Newman's surprisingly crudely over the top slide-whistle and horn 'comic' underscoring all but stones the scene to death, a surprising lapse of judgment from a great composer in a film revolving around classical music.) In the hands of an actor with a modicum of physical comedy timing it could have been gold, but instead it's almost reduced to a technical exercise.  But the same could be said for much of the film. The idea of having the execution and resolution of Harrison's fantasies dictated by the pace of the music he conducts (Rossini for murder, Wagner for mournful forgiveness, Tchaikovsky for suicide) is inspired, but it results in scenes that feel forced, as if at the mercy of a galley slave master's drumbeat. That the scenes themselves are so predictable doesn't help, as goodwill and admiration gradually gives way to boredom in the second half.  There are, however, two saving graces. One is the scene in private detective Edgar Kennedy's office, where Harrison is furious to discover that the man he has come to castigate is a knowledgeable fan with his own tale of loss. The scene is crudely performed and reads better than it plays, but there's heart and humanity there that's lacking in too much of the rest of the film. But the film's genuine standout moment is the orchestra rehearsal, one of the best pieces of filmed musical performance in the movies, not only showing how the music is constructed but showing the life, character and human soul behind it. The loss of those qualities in the rest of the movie is all the more keenly felt in an increasingly arid and overplayed technical exercise. 
 Did not receive local alert only regional. Tried to call customer service for several days, could not get through. Sent e-mail to customer support 3 weeks ago, still no response. Would not buy Midland again 
 Maya Angelou is an expert at writing easily remembered catchphrases and proverbial tidbits that have all the taste of wisdom with half the calories.  She fills her fans with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, she inspires them, she makes them feel as if she speaks The Truth.  In other words, she's great at writing motivational proverbs.  She is not, however, a poet.  Not even close.  She displays virtually no poetic craft and shows no real skill at compression, imagery, figurative language, and metaphor, to name a few tools that make a piece of writing a poem.  At best, this collection would bore the pants off of any serious reader of poetry.  At worst, it will make them want to gouge their eyes out with a pair of #6 knitting needles.  If you think this is poetry, you haven't read any poetry yet 
 the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known Hollywood cliche in film making.I applaud the effort.the chicks in this Film are Happening Babes Fo SHO.but there ain't much to the Film but it has some fun to it 
 I didn't like these for a few reasons. They take up too much room in my freezer. They take too long to thaw. I don't care for the avent isis pump. I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker. 
 I can't believe people like Eazy-E more than Dr.Dre. Dre is way better than sleazy-e. Stay with Dre, not sleazy-e 
 A brainless, predictable soap opera with some of the most laughably bad dialogue I have ever heard.  This is easily the most embarrasing "serious" film I have seen and is argued to be one of the worst films of all time (the film "won" several Razzies, including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay).  Adrian Lyne -- whose credits as a director alternate between the interesting and the unpleasant/sleazy -- directs this movie as if it were a shampoo commercial.  A woman (Demi Moore) and her whiny, annoying husband (Razzie recipient Woody Harrelson, who unfortunately disappoints) are in a state of financial crisis.  Because the couple is, well, spoiled and none-too-bright, they go to Las Vegas with the intention of winning money in order to buy their dream house.  Their plan fails, and I personally did not care because neither character is especially sympathetic.  Along comes Robert Redford, who offers them 1 million dollars in return for sex with Moore.  Then, the marriage collapses in emotional turmoil and numerous bad scenes play out (including a curious one in which a classroom of immigrants learning English from Moore miraculously understand English all of a sudden and laugh at a bunch of jokes told by Redford).   The story is trashy and sleazy, and there's not one sympathetic character in the bunch.  The seasoned Redford has some good moments, but even he cannot save the picture.  Overall, this is a Razzie "classic," to say the least, and it contains one of the most laughably bad lines I've ever heard in a film: "I really wanted you to have that hippo."  (note: If you are now wondering how a hippo ties into the film, I advise you to not bother giving it any thought) 
 Some nice ideas in a book with far too many pages. This story could be told in an article (OK, I'll admit a lenghty one), but it doesn't need a whole book to tell. And, although the ideas are nice, they are certainly not essential and they could be traded in for other equally good ideas on user-experience (imho 
 I still have not received this item, not sure what is going on ?  If you have any answers I would love to hear about it?  Thank 
 Dr. Hawkins first book, Power vs Force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology.  However, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement.  There are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests.  This book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques.  The actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what Hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid.  The levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to NOT let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.   Hawkins explores issues about media, politics, religion, spirituality, history, philosophies, healing arts, entertainment, and more, and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters. He seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters, liars, and two-faced sociopaths.  He has a negative view of conspiracy theorists, many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don't resort to Hawkins' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth.  Hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method, as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology, but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod.  I hope Hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful, responsible work in those areas.  For now I'd encourage Hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job, many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds, and the overall maturity of consciousness in America is not greater than the rest of the world 
 I was very surprised to learn that Helen Fremont was able to become a lawyer and knew nothing about the Holocaust. What kind of education did she obtain? How was it possible that she wasn't interested in her parent's history? Even if they were Roman Catholics. Book is full of historical errors (Warsaw was captured within hours, it was safer to be a Pole in the streets a Lvov during the German invasion)  It bothered me that the street names were Misspelled (Owacowa instead of Owocowa, Mariacki Platz insead of Plac Mariacki) The story itself was very interesting. I wish however it was written by her parents. 
 First, I completely disagree with the major conclusions of this book, and frankly, even with its moral perspective.  I find it to be a one-sided work of propoganda which takes the form of an apologetic for the homogenization of the intellectual professions.  This work is a disgrace, highly misleading, and even dangerous if taken literally or adopted in whole as the correct perspective.  Evidence presented is extremely selective and the interpretation is guided mainly by the authors' predetermined values.  Forget about a balanced, multi-perspective book here.  Aside from the dry academic tone of the title, it is anything but an 'objective' or multi-perspective book. Risks are glossed over and lamentable changes to the academic profession are encouraged to be taken as far as possible in this book.  It is a wolf in sheep's clothing - a book pretending to be by and for academics, with an academic mindset; instead, it's a book by managers who, if they could, would devise standardized tests to determine the competence of professors.  People who see homogenization as inevitable and even desirable.  Not my kind of people. The most disturbing thing about this book is that it is sadly, correct and useful as a vision of where higher education may be headed, and it's a dystopian place.  The state (and particularly, the powerful class that manages the state) does want to control universities very badly, and they are finding "subtle" ways to do it.  This book offers a glimpse into some of the things they plan to do in order to end academic freedom while giving the public (and even some very misled academics) the illusion that academic freedom still exists 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
  After the excitement of THE WOLVES OF CALLA, SONG OF SUSANNAH is more than a little disappointing. Susannah and her demon possessor, Mia, are off to give birth to whatever, Roland, Eddie, Jake and Callahan are in hot, well, lukewarm pursuit, and for many pages nothing happens. Many, Many pages. This book plays to the worst parts of the series, overly mannered speeches, cryptic messages, 19's all over the place and page upon page of meaningless dialogue that will interest only fans of minutia. There are a few moments where things pickup, like when King himself makes an appearance, and while it proves  interesting for King to take such a hard look at his 70's self, it's not exactly Kilgore Trout meeting Vonnegut in BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS. Another problem I had was that unlike the clear and horrifying creations of Wrightson and Whalen, Anderson's blurry impresionistic images left me cold and did nothing to enhance this volume of THE DARK TOWER. For the second to last book in the series I had hoped for some real resolutions to some of the problems, but I guess King decided to save everything for the last book.   P.S. Man, if I heard that baby called "the chap" one more time... 
 After reading all of the reviews, I thought this would be a good, insightful read for someone who is interesting in the culinary arts.  Instead, it's like listening to someone tell you a long boring story and you don't have the heart to stop them.  He goes on about little projects like finding the cheapest subsistence diet, the difference between ketchups, and all the ridiculous diets he has been on.  Very boring, inconclusive, and uninteresting.  Also, I wouldn't trust anyone's palette who likes Diet Coke as much as this guy.  $14 bucks wasted 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT ALL! That was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album. All the songs are much too similar, the guy's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B., for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near that, either 
 As a freshman in university, I thought this would be a funny novel, but I was completely wrong.  This is one of the most horrible books I have ever read; so bad in fact, that I was tempted to use it as toilet paper after 20  pages in to it.  But I read it all, and was bored and regretful that I had  bought it by the time I finished 
  I can tell these guys aren't coming back. The whole Im a thug thing has gotten way out of hand. Hope they had fun because it's over for Crime Mob 
 I love Mr. Koontz and have long read his novels...Watchers, Intensity, Odd Thomas and so on but this was dissappointing, not to mention just plain depressing. And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.  Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old. How about a smart cat or raven for your next novel, maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do? 
 	My opinion of this book is that it would be better off in the hands of a nine year old.  In a way this book was a bit too juvenile for me.  The hardest word was "hernia".   	The story took place in Moon, Texas, where the roads hadn't been paved yet.  Grandpap becomes ill.  He moves with the Jaynell's family.  Gradpap buys an emerald greed Cadillac.  He teaches Jaynell how to drive.  Grandpap passes away.  They sell the Cadillac.  Not exactly my idea of an interesting book.  This book was very vague.  I couldn't even find the climax.  I would not recommend this book if there were others. 
 I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first.  But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.    My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda.  The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught 
 Anyone who listens to that Harvard nut-job is a sap. This book is alright, not as good as Gilbert's, though. The way to go is to pick ONE book that makes sense to you and study it well.  Harvey's "forest and trees" theory begs the question: If he falls down in a forest and there is no one there to hear his cries for help, will anyone care 
 The Cobra Event is a jarring book, not because of the plausibility of the plot nor because it goes into excruciating pains to describe dead boies and their subsequent autopsies, but because there are so many errors on its pages. Worse, there are whole chapters devoted to nothing that advances the plot or helps me undersatand the story better; pages and pages of filler - it was like reading a doughnut.  Among the worst are:  --Changing verb tenses in the middle of a paragraph. I have no idea why a paragraph that starts with the past perfect tense suddenly switches to the present tense in the second sentence. And it didn't happen just once.  --Using "you" all the time. The book has this very condescending, accusatory tone when it directly addresses me, as though it knows what I know and don't know.  --Maxing out the filler potential. I know that detail helps to make stories seem authentic, but really, taking a paragraph to explain the history of Katz's Delicatessan is superfluous.  Argh 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 The very first chapter talks about folks starting to invest in real estate.  Of course they bought all their investment properties  using other peoples money (mortgages), which is fine. The only question for Mr. Kiyosaki: Which bank is giving a conventional mortgage for the investment property at 95 % LTV, meaning putting only 5% down? As far as I know 5% downpayment  or less is available for PRIMARY residence ONLY. You can not have 2 primary residencies. The Bank can see in your credit report how many mortgages you have. When applying for the new mortgage bank requires to explain all other mortgages in the credit report. You definetely can not buy all 5 properties -  with 5 % down. It is very inaccurate and misleading. Minimum downpayment for the investment property is 20%, not every bank will do it, a lot of them will ask for 25-30% downpayment for investment properties. Go to your local bank and check it out. So Mr. Kiyosaki is not telling the truth? Are those stories REAL? Seems like he is getting rich on writing very controversial books using the success of the first couple of them but not really investing in real estate. 
 this item is rubbish... it leaks, quite dangerous since water and electricity don't mix. i got it, plugged it in filled it 3/4 full and had to stop cause water was all over my floor.  i have already packed it up and will return it asap 
 I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope.  This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.    The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks!  The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful.  I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects.  Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored.  NOT recommended 
 Tamyra Gray has talent.  The songs here are merely o.k.  They could have been better.  I've heard worse.  However, Miss Gray lacks that special something called "charisma", that of which stars are made.  If this CD has not sold well and has not exceeded expectations it is because Ms. Gray herself does not have the "X" factor for success.  This is why she lost American Idol.  Talent yes....but talent is not enough.  The pop culture and what appeals to the masses is not talent alone but charisma.  I fail to see it coming through on this CD.  It is a true disappointment.  
 If "liberal" ideas have the effect on women that the author claims, then how was George W. Bush reelected in 2004?  Obviously the "liberal message" isn't working and her thesis has been disproven.  Besides, these magazines' portrayals of super-rich celebrities as "normal" people just like you and me is a prime example of how in the U.S. we are taught to worship the wealthy and to believe we, too will be wealthy one day.  Sorry Ms. Blythe, that is not a liberal idea, but a conservative one.  Also, the gossipy, malicious, tell-all that this book is merely panders to the lowest common denominator and to the baser instincts which conservatives always bemoan liberalism and the sleazier aspects of pop culture as appealing to.  I'll be the first to admit that most mainstream women's magazines influence women to believe they are overweight and that these magazines sanitize celebrities' home lives, but if you want a solution to or an intelligent analysis of these issues, this isn't it.    
 It is very unusual for Brill to take a book out of publication.  However, they did with this title and the one other of Eisenman's that they printed prior to his monumental folly, "James the Brother of Jesus."  Bluntly put, this man is an embarassment to all scholarship because of his continued and persistent misreading of the historical evidence.  The work in question is completely covered in his later books.   You can find far less expensive examples of his scholarship on the used market.  Try one of those first.  If you like it, read a dozen other books by recognized authorities on the subject matter. Michael Baigent books do not count.  Eisenman is a great favorite of the Jesus denier crowd.  He is also a tenured hack in the University of California system.  He most recently surfaced in print opining that the naming of Judas Iscariot was one of the greatest slanders in history which has resulted in horrific repercussions down through the years.  This was carried in the ever scholarly Huffington Blog.  If you think I am tough on the man, do a Google search on his name, Robert H. Eisenman, and read Anthony Salardini's review of his book, "James the Just. 
 Is it generally a rule that miniseries based off books have to suck so badly?  I've seen a million TV miniseries based off novels that have sucked so horrendously, but NONE like this.  Get this straight before I continue: I LOVE the book version of The Tommyknockers; it's my alltime favorite Stephen King novel (second-favorite: The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon... review to come later) and I liked how it took the time to reveal key things about the plot: how Haven got started (and the "sowing and reaping" the itinerant preacher got on with the virgins in the cornfield), how Gard and Bobbi originally got to be such good friends (more than that actually; they dated for some time), and what actually went on in the woods that unleashed the evil.  Here... bulls**t.  Utter bulls**t.  Here is why I think the movie sucked:  - The series is only 2 hours long... what the f**k?  A novel the size of The Tommyknockers can't possibly be fit into a 2-hour long series.  What about the minor stuff that, although minor, can't be taken out without a serious loss in credibility?  Like Hilly.  There wasn't much of him or his disappearing act with his little brother David, and there certainly wasn't enough of his tenure at Altair-4 or their frantic search for his body.  And what about Gard and how he opened up the hole to suck in his conniving ex-poker buddy after getting cheated on a poker game?  That scene would have been amazing in the movie.  But no.  None of it.  -The changes the authors made in the plotline.  Seriously. Get some things at least partially right, then change what you have to in order to fulfill whatever sick and twisted purpose you had in mind when changing the original.  But they take it too far.  Example: in the novel, Gard and Bobbi's teeth originally fell out because of their "becoming"; now, nothing.  And, the aliens themselves have a full set of teeth (that part in the novel)... so why the (insert obscenity here) did they change it?!?!  The only reason I gave this particular hellfest two stars is cause the original was made by Stephen King.  No other reason.  If you are looking for a good time, buy the damn book.  It's the real thing- unlike this piece of s**t.  Overall: 2 stars  Why: for failure to be entertainin 
 This book was very disappointing. I read five pages and returned it to the store. The title was very misleading.   I sat down to read about Grainne and her female contemporaries and ended up reading about how the author had dinner and tea with some Americans... so something or other. After I read that far, I put it down and took a nap. 
 This book just says a lot of banalities in the long-winded "out of bed" chapters (e.g. be compassionate to women), and nothing new in the highly anticipated "in bed" chapters (e.g. women like cuddling). Only buy this if you are struggling to find something other than missionary style, or can't figure out how to compliment a woman 
 If you have a lot of extra money to spend on plastic, pre-made, self-watering containers, then this is definately the book for you!    There is ZERO information in here on making your own self-watering containers, save for the advice of using a "ready-made insert".  Personally, I don't have the energy to extrapolate the info herein, and then, McGuyver-like, invent my own self-watering containers.  And I certainly have better thing to do with my money than buy plastic pots designed for stay-at-home suburban-organic moms with too much money.  If you don't have money to burn, instead get:   "Moveable Harvests" by Crandall and Crandall.  Their soil mix recipes haven't failed me yet.  I disagree with their preference for hybrid vegetable varieties, but nobody's perfect.  "Bountiful Container" by McGee and Stuckey (if you can overlook the cutsey post-menopausal twitterings [waa-ay too much info on edible flowers], there is a ton of info in there)--  Or, if you're a Gen-X urban gardener- "You Grow Girl" by Gayla Trail.  Gayla ROCKS 
 These other critics need a sample of madame O'Connor. They'd then see the error in their statements. Muera a Eudora 
 This story is full of surprises, which really made me want to keep reading. In one point of the story Palmer tells the "gang" that he does not want to become a wringer. This surprised me greatly because I thought that Palmer would become a wringer so he could keep his friends. I learned to always show your feelings and don't do something that you don't want to do just to get friends. I recommend this Fiction-Horror genre to readers of all ages.   
 This is an eccentric book. It's actually a hybrid, two stories in one, but only one of them is good.  In the good one, the author tells-in standard English-of her epic battle to stop chemical companies from polluting the Gulf Coast waters that she and her neighbors had fished for generations.  In the bad story she tells us-in polluted English-about herself, using an ungrammatical persona that seems an affectation aimed at being perceived as a pugnacious, in-your-face, don't-mess-with-me woman.  Too bad. She's an interesting, courageous woman in her own right, with no need of affectation. Almost alone, she took on the big corporations who with impunity were ravaging her Gulf Coast environment, spilling huge toxic wastes into land, sea and air with criminal disregard for public health, worker safety, state and federal regulations, and in general all God's creatures. These corporate behemoths were able to rape the environment because their deep pockets had bought compliance among venal local officials, political influence from Texas to Washington, D.C., and their hiring power and big payrolls silenced the easily cowed.  The only person they couldn't silence or buy off was Diane Wilson, whose story is a model of how to fight both city hall and Goliath and win, and is a tribute to her grit and pluck.    But why the author laces her story with such graceless prose is puzzling, and why the publisher let her do it that way defies understanding. Listed on the copyright page are the names of a Chelsea Green editor, a managing editor, a copy editor, and a proofreader, all of whom presumably worked with this manuscript.  Did none of them know that bad writing in a good cause is not nearly as effective as good writing in a good cause? Did none of them know that a double negative actually says the opposite of what the speaker intended and that, in any case, nothing is gained for any cause by a disingenuous use of clumsy and ignorant speech?  Didn't they notice that Miss Wilson told the story of her fight in standard English, but the story of how she felt about the fight in another English altogether, one that sounded too ignorant to have come from the same person who told the first story? Maybe not. Dust-jacket copy bills the book as "a novelistic tale," and Chelsea Green's specialty is environmental activism, not fiction. Anyhow, here's a sampling of Ms. Wilson's writing that somehow passed muster with an intelligent writer and escaped an editor's pencil, too: "Doomsday don't always stay doomsday." 	"I had ran out of answers." "So the coffee got drank and a jarful of candy got ate . . . `	 	Then there's the just plain bad writing: ". . . panic clambered through my body worse than two babies running through the hall . . ." ". . . he wasn't no dandelion tiptoeing around the issues." ". . . the sun laid a heavy hand on her hair." ". . . his tone was still as feverish as a preacher with a message scribbled in his pocket." On the plus side, here's one of the few good ones: Describing oystermen who filed in after a long day at sea to sign her petition, Ms. Wilson wrote, "They looked tired-as if the wind and the cold had blown out the light in their eyes."    A similar cold front must have moved through the editorial offices of Chelsea Green Publishing Company in White River Junction, Vermont, while An Unreasonable Woman was being prepped for press. Green River (and Ms. Wilson) should stick to straight-forward reporting from the environmental front.  True-life experiences can be novelized with great effect. Truman Capote and Norman Mailer proved that with, respectively, In Cold Blood and The Executioner's Song. But they didn't pick an ignorant-sounding narrator to tell the tale.   
 This was the worst book I have ever read.  The single most devastating experience in Barbara Johnson's life seems to be that her son was gay.  Not that two other sons were killed tragically, but that one of her two remaining children was involved in "the homosexual lifestyle."  Despite having only two surviving children, Johnson refuses to associate with her son unless they can completely ignore that he is gay.  After he leaves home (who could blame him) she says, "Whatever Lord" and continues on her merry way.  The fact that there is never any mention of what her son must have been going through all this time when he has been rejected by the one person in the world who should love him unconditionally is only one of the reasons this book is so upsetting.  Johnson writes about rejecting her son in such a flippant manner it is impossible to have any sympathy for her at all.   To her credit, she does finally write a few pages about loving your kids no matter what, but her "no matter what" seems to only mean once they come around to your way of thinking.   There are a lot of better sources for people coping with the lifestyle choices of a child than this book, which would have you brush your "flawed" child away like a gnat 
    In the book when the Time Traveller saved Weena from drowning in the river. I liked this part beacause the Time Traveller was heroic.                 Also another part in this book is when the Time Traveller started the fire in the forest to save Weena and himself. I didn't like this part because if the Time Traveller had used his common sense he wouldn't have started a fire in the forest without water or a way to put it out.     The diffent settings in the book were in the Time Traveller's house in the 1800s, in the future in the year 802,701, and much further into the future were almost nothing existed.     The main conflict in this book was that the Time Traveller's Time Machine was stolen by the Morlocks. It was resolved by the Time Traveller finding his time Machine, and getting it back so he could get away from the Morlocks.      All in all this book wasn't really up to my standards in action pack adventure.  I didn't really find this book very exciting and to me it was a very boring book. There were a few exciting parts though but that's about it 
 Being a teacher and Denzel Washington fan, I thought I might find some enjoyment and inspiration from a film purporting to illustrate the difficulties and solutions of the inner city high school experience. I experienced neither. Only frustration penetrated my senses as I wasted a couple of hours watching this film (after wasting ten bucks buying it)!  The story line might have worked, though I doubt it, if a few obvious needs had been mandated in the production and direction, like proper casting and a believable script. Worst of these offenses was the casting, as all of the "high school" students were at least twenty-five, and most older. Talk about suspension of disbelief! The same cast would have worked were they cast as the parents of the students! At times Denzel looked younger than the student he was mentoring. Indeed, it was preposterous.  I'm sure Mr. Washington looks upon this film as nothing more than a poor experience on the way to excellence, one of those setbacks we learn from to help us find our way.  Don't waste your time or money 
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 The book was supposed to be a translation, but the author has ended up publishing her biases in the garb of presenting it in narrative form. A quick search on the author reveals that she is a controversial character and that Encarta removed her contribution after investigating her scholarship.   As someone interested in learning about Hinduism, I was looking for someone who could just give me the facts instead of a polemicist. The book was a huge disappointment. I wish I had known about Encarta yanking her piece on the grounds of poor scholarship before I embarked on reading her "translation. 
 I thought the original was pretty good, but this sequel was pure torture to watch! I'de rather eat a giant roach, than watch this movie again! Without question, one of the worst comedys ever written 
 I love her relaxed phrasing and the tone and easy flow of her vocal 
 I'm sorry, but I thought that both women in the book, Joan Anderson and Joan Erikson, were not only uninteresting but also annoying.  Joan Anderson struck me as totally self-centered, and Joan Erikson as too "cutesy" and even conceited.  I find it hard to believe that weaving little pieces of cloth using colors to represent life stages would so suddenly unlock the mystery of Joan A's life.  Reminds me of adult "Brownies" . . . Too cutesy for me.  Sorry.   
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 When I reviewed Franken's "Why Not Me?" I explained that I had read it because I loved "Rush Limbaugh is a Big..." but "Why Not Me?" had fallen short of my high expectations.  THIS book was even MORE disappointing.  The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny.  Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- "Lies..." of course).  It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something.  Otherwise, pick something else by Franken.  ANYTHING else by Franken 
 I read all the Amazon reviews but still decided to go with the Avent sippy cup since I had relatively good experiences with the Avent bottles. Unfortunately, leaking is a real problem with these cups. Not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well I try to fasten the lid, but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips. He ends up with a mouth full of milk. So much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup. I orginally used Playtex and he liked that well enough. I only switched because the Playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear. Now, after wasting money on Avent, I'll go back to Playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try. I don't usually write Amazon reviews but I figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble. Unless you want milk EVERYWHERE, I would definitely avoid these cups. 
 I just finished this book, and I wasn't too impressed.  I was expecting something more about the current conflicts between red states and blue states, an analysis of such conflicts, and what can be done about reconciling them; or even approaching the idea of citizenship through "branding" and fostering something similar to "consumer loyalty."  (That was the impression I got from reading the book jacket, anyway.)  Instead, the main point I got from the book is that "countries often contain different groups that disagree and might want to secede someday; no borders or nations are permanent."  Coming off a century in which the U.S. gained two states, Eastern Europe fractured, and many other international borders shifted, all I can say is a sarcastic, "imagine that."  Some people say that the formatting makes it easier to digest; I found it distracting.  Open up this book and you'll see an odd mix of formatting - some sentences are in large type, some are in small, some are oddly indented, and some even cascade down the page.  It reminded me of my friend's blog - she used to post song lyrics in that same format, with some lines given more emphasis than others.  As a result, I had a very hard time taking this book seriously.  Content-wise, I'm not sure how to judge it.  There were many citations and statistics and anecdotes and facts, but there wasn't an in-depth discussion of anything, and there probably aren't many readers who will go to the endnotes and evaluate each source.  (I sure didn't.)  I got the sense that it wasn't as well-thought-out as it should have been, with Enriquez citing a Yahoo! message board posting to back up his case about racism, coming to the simple conclusion that it's ironic that many liberals oppose No Child Left Behind because they traditionally love education reform (he doesn't acknowledge that there might be legitimate, non-political reasons for anyone to disagree with NCLB), and seeming to play games with statistics without any discussion of the studies/polls he took them, the methods with which they were gathered, or what their implications are beyond the obvious.  The book as a whole seemed too oversimplified.  There were some interesting passages - for instance, one chapter I found interesting described the different regions of Mexico and how they might split, if such a split should occur.  Enriquez says that we can look at what happens in other countries to see how future splits might occur in our own country.  The big statement of the book is that divisions are possible in any country; in a book titled "The Untied States of America," though, he should have focused more on the problems specific to the U.S., and what can be done about them.  When he does discuss the U.S., he spends a disproportionate amount of space on the periphery (such as U.S. terrorities abroad), and not enough on the red state/blue state polarization that seems to be sweeping the nation.  In short?  Some of it is interesting, and with the bizarre formatting and pictures, it's probably the shortest 275-page book you'll ever read (352 pages, if you include the long list of endnotes).  However, I don't think it's worth the price of admission - there are probably books that discuss this topic and do a better job of it 
 I expected more of a range of styles in this time period. A bit disappointed 
 Your service was excellant. The movie we ordered for a relative who could not find it. Why ; I have no idea as I did not care for the movie when it was new. We will be ordering other items from you in the future and are very satisfied with your availabilty of movies etc 
 The Item you sent me was not the right item. I think?  Then you sent me the same item back to me.? Did ask for knowledge on what the difference was on REISSUE and REMASTER. I could have already purchased this item, REISSUE, at the store down the street for less the amount that I spent at Amazon.  Sorry not a satisfied customer 
 I don't particularily appreciate athlete autobiographies, especially those written by figure skaters and gymnasts. They lack depth, inside information, insight, and good writing.  Sasha Cohen's autobiography is no exception. It is a good book if you're a fan of her, especially if you want pictures (although there aren't too many of them in here). The thing that irritates me the most is how fluffy most of these types of autobiographies are. Sasha's autobiography is a piece of fluff. There is no information on what the real world of figure skating is like or anything along those lines. It just gives you her basic story, how she got started in skating, et cetera. The writing style seems pretty upbeat and happy, and I find it hard to believe that she wrote this all by herself (ghost writer, anyone?)  I also think it's a little too early in her career for an autobiography (I think this was published before her silver medal win at the '06 Olympics). But, anyway, if you want a basic little autobiography of the U.S.'s latest figure skating Olympina, you may want to check this one out. Otherwise, skip it- it's nothing too special 
 KRS ONE, Talib Kweli, 2pac, Mos Def, Obie Trice, Gangstarr, EPMD, Erick Sermon, Eazy E, Eric B. & Rakim, MC Lyte, NWA, Public Enemy, Mobb Deep, Lil Cease, Nas, Chino XL, DMX, Biggie, Kanye West, Wu Tang Clan, ONYX, Rakim, Redman, Royce Da 5'9, Warren G, Xzibit, Cypress Hill. All of these rappers and duos are wayy better than the (...) your hearing on the radio, BET, MTV, MTV2 or whatever station the world is pushing at your faces. im telling you rap first reached its downfall of pop rap category since 2000 when Big Pimpin and Back That Thang Up first came out. now its goota be put to a halt. is this the message we want america to hear and follow? hoes, money, women, guns, cars, ice, is this the message i want my kids to read and to make them thing this is ok and this is everything in the world? why cant these rappers rap about something more meaningful like how hard it was to grow up in the ghetto or racism or politics? Rap needs an uplift, expand your mind into good rap and you will go far 
 I bought this dictionary before going to Iceland for a year as an exchange student.  It was useful for the very, very basics...sometimes.  I found it frustrating when I couldn't find words in it that I commonly heard in  conversation.  The lack of cross-references, as noted by another reviewer,  serves only to make the book smaller and more useless.  If you really want  a useful dictionary, do what I did and buy one in Iceland 
 The slipcover barely covered my sofa, will not cover the lower front and it barely hangs over the backside.  It keeps sliding off, where I have to adjust it several times during the day, if I could I would get my money back 
 I'm dumbfounded by all of the credit given this book, especially by former author's who have written about the Agency and the subject of intelligence.  Shame!  There's an old saying in CIA that says, "There's nothing more useless than a well known secret," which leaves me to wonder of the purpose of this book, other than to make a fast buck.  I get the feeling that what we have here is "payback" from a trainee that has been found "wanting" in a program that challenged him beyond his talents.  As a former intelligence officer with 38 years of service in the intelligence business from both a civilian and a military perspective, I am intimately familiar with the training program described in this book not only as former instructor but also (and later) as one of its managers.  While I could nit pick this thing do death, I'll raise only a few questions that challenge the veracity of its contents.  First, in my not so humble opinion the segment regarding remote delivery bugs (no pun intended), p. 17, such as the "dragon fly" is pure fiction given microphone technology (not to mention  battery technology as well as laser technology) 40 years prior to Class 11.  Back then, we would have needed a Stork and a diaper to deliver  the dragonfly to its intended target.  And what about the Agency, with all of its resources, needing the author to gratuitously get it a "real dragonfly" to put on its demo board.  Give me a break!  Second, the segment, p.54, regarding car surveillance training is ludicrous.  The author relates having been shown pictures of purported car crashes from previous class mishaps that calls to my mind a picture resembling a demolition derby.  Consider the potential impact, if true, of the property damage, personal injury, and possible death to US citizens, not to mention court battles, as a result of a classified training program undertaken by a secret organization of the US Government having "deep pockets"--a veritable personal injury lawyer's paradise.  Allen Dulles would be turning over in his grave were this a true case.  Third, the segment, p. 223, regarding disguises is almost as bad, if not worse, than the one above.  From the author's description of events one would think the Agency has turned loose a group of trainees going to a Halloween party in a mall of all places.  This whole segment discredits the fine work of the men and women in the "disguise department" who are nothing but professional.  The bit about the police officer who immediately connects the trainees to the Farm as a result of their disguises is even too much for my imagination to accept.  I'd give this book half a star, were it possible, so as not to denigrate my fallen colleagues whose stars appear on a wall as the author describes on page four of his book.  Upon completion of this book, which I found to be a challenge, I come away with a feeling that the author has mastered the art of "Bovine Excrement."  I'm convinced it was an art that he had honed long before he joined the Agency in a career that was far too long in my "not so humble" opinion. 
 After serveral months of use, "Card Error" was shown on my Canon Digital Rebel for my 512MB Viking card, which was half full with pictures. Fortunately, I just lost a few of pictures.  I tried to format the file; "Card Error" kept occuring on my Rebel.  This 512MB Viking card is now used for my data files.    Probably, 512MB Viking cards are not designed for high Mega Pixel camera and taking many shots in a short period of time (i.e. 3 shots/sec.).  My Canon A40 has no problems when used with the 512MB Viking card so far.  Probably, I am going to buy a 512MB card from Sandisk or Simple Tech 
 i was gonna make a point, but fabz made it for me  i was gonna say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles  and Yayo's hit singles werent really hits  his songs were on the radio & tv for probably about a month or two  if thats what you call a hit then you crazy  the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd  he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 SONGS on the cd   a couple of good songs dont make it good cd  you want to see what other people think of the Yayo album read the reviews for it  and jeezy  please  he always been garbag 
 I've never had such-a-slap in the face biased book presented to me for college curriculum. Very dissapointing 
 I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed.  I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending. 
 This book is simply unfortunate. Firstly, if this book is the first book you have read by this author, and if you are so disappointed by it that you do not want to read any of his other work you will be doing yourself a grave disservice. When Coelho writes from his heart and not his vanity he is an amazing storyteller. Thus, this book is not representative of some of his previous work, which is quite excellent. With this book it seemed that he felt that people love his books so much that they would also love reading about his process in writing his books, and not just that he uses the book as an autobiographical tale. Major problems for me with this book were that clearly the author and the main male character are one in the same. Coelho never admits this, but he has flagrantly made the character so similar to himself that it is insanely ridiculous that he is not recognizing this as an autobiography of some sort. Secondly, the characters are dreadfully and tediously boring, and mentioning the Eiffel tower, his success, fame, money, loyal readership, and open marriage a gazillion times doesn't change this fact. Thirdly, he somehow has convinced himself that breaking up with someone that you have spent a decade of your life with, and then thinking about them and missing them is obsessive instead of a natural part of grieving a broken heart, this makes the whole zahir story line quite ridiculous. Fourth, what has come across as bits of insightful wisdom in his other books seem forced and contrived in this story, because everything else in the book is so ludricrous. Lastly, the story of his missing/runaway wife made no sense to me, and no matter how much I tried to sympathize with something in the storyline I was not able to. If you are interested in knowing many details, however boring they may be, about the author's life this book will fulfill what you are looking for. Otherwise, I agree that it really is something to be borrowed, because paying for this book would be a sad waste of money, and you would already be wasting your time by reading it. Why waste both 
 Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!) So my advice is this: Be extremely carefull if youve never used Illustrator before. It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use, but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it.   
 The only funny thing about this book is the chapter where Moore explains why he thinks O.J. Simpson is innocent. That's a real thigh-slapper. Everything else is standard Tofurkey for the liberal choir. I urge right-wingers to read it in order to be able to win any debates with folks who support Moore and his point of view 
 Well, Sufjan Stevens has done it again, that's the really sad part. In his quest to bring a uniquely angst-besotted perspective to all 50 states, Stevens has neatly sliced notch #2 into his belt.  Personally, I'm looking forward to Rhode Island.  
 Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner.  He goes thru the motions of "doing his job" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.  I find Jose Saramago's "Blindess" to be a far superior book to The Plague.  Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving.  The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.  I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over.  I would pass on this book 
 Nine inch nails are the only band on this cd worth listening to, this sound track is crap 
 This has to be one of the most frustrating and dull spirituality and live food books I have ever read. There are pages and pages of 'the author' (he refers to himself in the third person) procrastinating on religion, history etc. Yup he's right, a live food diet will raise your kundalini. So does walking in the counrty, having a great love life, being positive and doing work you love. Which is basically what he is saying here.There, I've managed to say it in two sentances. If you're into personal growth, and spiritual development, try David Wolfe's books. Even though he plagurised Nature's First Law, the original is out of print, but it's a raw food philosophy masterpiece all the same. It's also the third of the length of Cousen's book. Or read Leonard Orr's Breaking The Death Habit, or the Indian classic 'Autobiography of a Yogi.' These three books will open your mind and soul to new and real possibilitesin an authentic heartfelt way, without the ego of the author getting in the way.  
 Well.  Nothing very interesting was presented.  There was not enough background information to really set the story.  So, while it was the classic formula romance, it lacked interest for me 
 Okay, so this is the diva-in-training that's supposed to bring glamour back to opera?  Yes, she is beautiful.  Shame those hands had to scrub floors; hope she makes it on the cover of Vogue someday.  However, she is not the Great New Hope for opera.  That voice is not suited for bel canto, or Mozart.  She sounds like a new Barbara Frittoli to me.  Frittoli, with a dash of Fleming. She has that taffy-pull to her voice, like Fleming, without the heavy portamento and sighing and all those other awful Fleming tricks.  The basic color of the voice is interesting, rather dark-hued, but the technique is not quite there, despite the studio producers' best attempts to turbo-charge her high notes.  Sorry, guys, but for romantic French and Italian bel canto reperatoire, I am sticking with Natalie Dessay 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 This book is way too short for such an interesting topic. Another problem is that it depicts women as main victims of weird medical practices in 19th and early 20th century, which is not entirely true. At those times (and may be true today in some cases also) one would be far better off if one stayed away from medical profession. Also, there are some really hillarious things about treating hysteria which authors didnot bother to mention. For the hystory of vibrators as legitimate medical treatment for hysteria, Rachel Maines has done very good job in dealing with this topic. What is also a pity is that authors didn't pursue various medical superstitions about females and different treatment of females which are present in modern times. For example, nobody questions the articles published in peer reviewed medical journal which state that patient's absolute refusal is "relative contraindication" for performing episiotomy. Is there any other surgical procedure which can be inflicted on a patient against patient's explicitly stated wishes? Or for example the fact that many health insurances cover Viagra but don't cover contraceptives. There are many topics well worth investigation which belog to the topic "Complaints and Disorders : The Sexual Politics of Sickness" which authors have chosen not to address in this pamphlet (can't even call it a book) 
 My first adventure in investigative journalism, I was immediately captivated by the beginning: cast of characters, general overviews, and the excitement that, based on the overview of how the book was to go, it was  worth reading. The material was well written in that Mr. Moldea went into  fine and captivating detail asto what the investigators were thinking, what  EVERYONE was thinking. I was a little suspicious of the passage where he  describes visiting with Sirhan Sirhan, and given the result of the  encounter, maybe made the author a little biased asto how his investigation  would lead to. The ending left me in a completely different place, where I  believe the author's evidence lead me to. His conclusions were not anything  I had agreed with. I feel he made the evidence ultimately fit the official  version of the tragic downfall of RFK that fateful June evening in 1968 
 Good golly this is a terrible book!  I endured the first 100 pages hoping it would get better and when it didn't, I skimmed to the end.  The plot is vapid, the writing is choppy and awkward, and I could guess the outcome by page 15.  Rich plows through the story,  not really explaining or developing anything, seemingly writing down the first idea that pops into her head.  Her lame attempts at humor are just that - lame.  There is no character development or realism here.  This is a book where total strangers become best friends in a five minute phone call, loving parents disown their daughter because she is trapped in an abusive relationship, a 32-year-old names all her bottles of Scotch "Albert," and terms like "Hoo-wah" and "bo-doob-oom-chaa" are meant to convey that a character is falling in love.   One of the things I really hate is when authors serve up a perfect character, one absolutely devoid of flaws or realistic human behavior, in an attempt to make the readers care.  Rich has swung too far the other way and has developed one of the most loathsome and irritating protagonists I have ever had the misfortune to meet.  Wanda is a selfish, obnoxious, loud-mouthed brat and by the end of the first chapter I was earnestly rooting for her complete and total demise.  The other character's sudden affections for her are wholly without merit and seem contrived, to say the least.  The front and back covers are littered with glowing tributes by other authors.  If they really think this is good writing, I'll make sure to avoid their works as well as Rich's.    The author's note brags that the first draft of this book was written in 25 days.  I believe it.  Maybe she should take a bit more time with her next attempt, if there is one 
 There are not a lot of good books on World War One.  This is not one of them.  It is about as informative and interesting as a high school history text 
 it stings, burns and irritated my skin. didnt PREVENT any breakouts. i bought the whole complex set and this is the one that hurts the most. 0 stars if i could. need i say more 
 I picked this up after seeing Bookslut cite it as one of the year's best reads.  The brief premise for the book sounded ok so I took a gamble.  Half way through the book, which was pathetically slow going, the only "thin" thing going on is the plot. Not that there is one.  Davis seems to get some major names dropped in-line with hers, so maybe -although doubtfully, I'm missing something. Or maybe she just swung and missed (big time) with this particular novel and her previous work is (at least) good. Although I'm not excited to give it a try based on this vapid effort. The occasional well written line and almost vaguely interesting characters (with no story though) but hardly worth a gamble. Or a dead tree.   All in all an unreadable book that is hardly the best of anything, let alone a stand-out for a year's worth of books. Try Simon Ings' _The Weight of Numbers_ for the *easy* winner of that prize. 
 After watching the movie and reading the reviews, I felt compelled to say something. The plot synopsis gives an adequate idea of what the movie is about, but not how it is told-which is dull 
 I was very disappointed to get an e-mail telling me that the book was out of stock and I would get a refund.  My daughter needed it for a class.  I ended up having to buy it at her bookstore at full price!   OUCH!!!!! 
 This was a nice, fast read and kept me awake during my commute but in NO way should be compared to Amy Tan.  I found the cliches and overly descriptive scenarios very dull and annoying.  Seemed to me that the author was trying too hard (as if overboard description makes for good writing).    The character of Lindsey was shallow and ran away from anything remotely unsafe.  She annoyed me also.  I found the characters of Pau Pau and Michael were most endearing, though.    I bought both "The Dim Sum of All Things" and "Buddha Baby" at the same time.  "Buddha Baby" was very similar to "Dim Sum" and annoyed me for the exact same reasons.  
 Not great coffee. Rocamojo and PuraVida, which amazon also sells is so much better--and those aren't great just good.  This is cheap coffee and tastes like it. I can't complain much at about $3 a pound but it's just ok, drinkable, but wouldn't buy again. 
 This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on "Ways and Means" in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy 
 This book is vaguley geared to thoose with disabilites. I would find this useful if I was in a wheel chair or had another obstacle. However having a pain disorder the book read to me of that of "NORMAL" healthy people. Wasted my limited money. 
 Ok well this book SUCKED!!! It's all about baribie kara. I was actully at first thinking Kara wasn't that bad for a character but beacause of this book now I think shes not a good character anymore. This book made me got really dissapionted. I really like the series and I will still continue reading the series but if she is going to steal Emily's horn AGAIN then I might as well not read anymore books about Kara. 
 the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie 
 I waited for 4 weeks and never got the book, i tried to contact the vendor 3 different times with no response. I purchased the book somewhere else and I got it the next day. I am still waiting for my money to be returned 
 A book well written but unfortunately highly biased justifying the russian atrocities. Certainly war is by itself an atrocity, but that do not allows an army to commit barbaric actions against women and children 
 Started listening to BT when Four was released.  Have purchased every studio album since then. Consider Straight On ... to be an overlooked masterpiece. Have been happy with every BT purchase ... 'til now.  I find five of the songs listenable, and the rest to be pretty much noise.  I can only hope that the band enjoyed it 
 I could not finish this book. The subject is fascinating but method of piecing together bits of newspaper articles, diaries and other accounts makes for cumbersome reading.  This is a graduate text book, not a story 
 I was looking for easier recipes then the ones given. My 4.5 year old boy is autistic and needs to be gluten free. I tried some recipes from the book, and it didn't appeal to his kid tastes. I try to put the whole family on Gluten free so what I do now is I just subsitute a GF flour blend I buy in the store with 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum per cup of flour. I use all my old favorite recipes with this replacement...cake, cookies, banana/zuccini bread, muffins, (didn't try regular bread yet). Everything comes out wonderful texture and all. Bob's red mill GF flour tastes so much better than whole wheat flour that I used before GF in all my recipes so far. Plus the bean flours are so healthy, definately add some ground flax seeds for added health benifits to whatever flours you use(omega's are so important). I think being GF is much easier than I ever imagined and you really don't need a GF cookbook. Just a food store with a natural food area for the flour & binder (or internet) and some creativity baking. Good Luck. 
 Living near McCarter Theater in Princeton my AP English class got to go see a production of this play while it was still being work-shopped for Broadway. Afterwards, my teacher asked what we all thought, of course first stating that she loved it so that all of the "favorite" students knew which opinion to take. They all raised their hands and said they loved it to, however, no one could say why.  Why not?  Because everyone hated it. I was the first to open the flood gate. "I thought it was ridiculous.  It has no real substance to the plot." "That's because the language is the point" "Well the language is the worst part.  Why would poor factory workers speak in absurdly flowery metaphors?  Especially ones that stupid ('Does the bicicle miss the boy?')?" My teacher flipped out at this. "You don't understand!  That's what literature is all about!  Metaphors!" The woman, asides from being a gigantic b**ch, was merely blinded by what reviews had told her to think and by her crush on Jimmy Smitts. A month later, the New York Times, reviewed the play after its Broadway premiere.  They said pretty much exactly what I thought.  I was going to bring the review into class, but why bother?  The woman already hated me.  PS. One earlier reviewer discussed how it was impossible to determine from the production the the daughter was raped.  During a Q&A afterwards, Emily Mann stated that they were having problems deciding how to show this.  I agree with the reviewer that they clearly didn't come to a good solution 
 Reading this book, I find that the author's ego interferes often with the documentation of how America went from Haute cuisine to the modern "American" restaurant.  One particular passage paints his mother (a cook) in the same light as Elizabeth David and M.F.K.Fisher, and leaves me wondering why, if she was so enlightened, do I not see her book on the shelf.  Throughout the book, he comes off as an average cook that could no longer take the heat, and left the kitchen to write.  With about 30 pages left to go, I cringe each time I reach for the book to attempt to finish it as what the author must perceive as colorful writing becomes more laborious with each page.  That said, there is definitely some interesting information, and if you can indeed labor through some of its issues, and weave around the author's bias, you will be somewhat rewarded.  (I especially found some of the La Pavillion information interesting after finishing Jacques Pepin's autobiography.)  Bottom line - if you are seriously interested in reading about American gastronomy, this might we worth a look if you can pick a copy up cheap.  I only wish someone with more skill had taken on the project, as it was, in fact, an excellent idea for a book 
 I bought I and II of this released Wolf's Rain because when I first read the reviews one of the reviewers claimed there was an alternate ending.  I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed because now that I have the second part there is no alternate ending and I now see that that review has been deleted. I think Amazon handled this whole thing very poorly.  We depend on what they provide to help us make our buying choices 
 I recieved the car and set it up according to the manufacturers  instructions and it didn't work! I contacted the manufacturer and they mailed me a shipping return label and I returned it to them. I am awaiting a new or fixed car back from them 
 When I first wrote a review for this movie I will confess that I was angry that it did not have any demons or evil monsters from hell, but upon further review I must take back my previous opinion, and say that though Doom the movie does not carry the spirit of doom into it it is still a pretty good movie. I believe that if the movie had been more original then I would have liked it (except for the first person part of the movie wich is why the rating is not higher aside from not being original). Overall as much as I hate to admit it this is a pretty good movie and worth watching (yes this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth) so go ahead and watch it it is by no standard the best video game based movie ever but decent overall.                                SORRY ABOUT MY FIRST REVIEW 
 Although the games on the card are good, most of the itmes on it, like Klondike and Slots are outdated. The games can not be moved off the card, and cannot be updated to the current version(s). You would be better off buying the games seperately 
 I did not buy the whole set. My review is for an 8" fry pan. It was one of those "try it" deals. I do not like the grooves in the pan because after, for instance, frying an egg, the grooves retain food and if you don't use a brush to scrub the grooves you'll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves. I can't imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware. Yikes 
 I did not like the book Adam of the road because it tells you a whole bunch of stuff about the characters before it gets to the story and by the time you get to the story you forget about the characters. I also did not like the fact that the book talks weird and it says like thou father I shall bla bla bla

 I think David Cross is a brilliant comic - even more amazing is that each show (Shut up you..., pride is back, etc.) is different material, not the same jokes again and again.  I would love to see a DVD of one or more of these standup shows.  However, this DVD is purely a documentary following Cross around to po-dunk clubs where people heckle him.  I don't want a documentary about how crappy being on the road doing comedy is - bring on the jokes - give us a DVD with his full standup routines!  Please 
 I never thought I would end up liking the albums with Brian better than the ones with Bon Scott, but that's how it turned out when I listened to all of them. Really the only AC/DC album that I completely love is "Back In Black", it's obvious why it's famous. I was surprised to find that I hated every song on this album, the melodies have no direction but have the same repetitious guitar patterns and simplicity of all the albums before it. Thank goodness Brian took over, though I'm certainly not saying it's good that Bon Scott died. None of the albums with him on it are any good, although I can't say that about "High Voltage" because I have yet to hear that one. This CD, however, is simply awful. Really boring, I nearly fell asleep listening to it. AC/DC's a bit more popular than they really need to be, though I can see why everyone would wear "Back In Black" shirts. NOt recommended 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 As one who has attended the oldest art school in United States, I feel I should mention some wonderful books that are available.  For the very best in professional technique, there is Nicolaides The Natural Way to Draw.  For absolute joy, encouragement and technique in drawing, there is Dvorak's Experimental Drawing. For the spiritual aspect, love of life and technique, there is Franck's  The Zen of Seeing.   All three books are treasures for anyone who really yearns to learn how to draw 
 .. about a student-t like distribution. Too much ado. There is no generalization of entropy (see the comment by Nauenberg and Balian in 2005 Europhysics News, e.g.) and no 'generalized thermostatistics. In fact, there is nothing but a postulated distribution that (as do student-ts typically) has a Gaussian limit. So what?   The claim of 'nonlinear Fokker-Planck" and "nonlinear Markov processes" was quite easy to explode: There is no such thing as a 'nonlinear Markov process'. There is no such thing as a 'nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation' for a conditional probability. A conditional probability with initial state memory is nonMarkovian. A conditional probability with initial state memory is not guaranteed to obey a Chapman-Kolmogorov equation and usually doesn't. A Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a Markov process. A Fokker-Planck equation with memory of an initial state in its drift and/or diffusion coefficients does not generate a Markov process. A nonlinear diffusion equation does not define any stochastic process at all, in fact a diffusion equation for a 1-point density defines no stochastic process at all. A 1-point density cannot be used to identify/define a stochastic process, both scaling Markov processes and strongly nonMarkov processes like fractional Brownian motion have exactly the same 1-point density, with widely differing conditional densities. For detailed explanations see cond-mat/0701589 and references therein.  It would be of interest to psychologists and sociologists to study and analyze how such 'movements', based on claims hanging in thin air, gain a multitude of followers and hangers-on, as this movement has. The literature over the last 10 years is riddled with wrong and empty papers on such stuff 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 I loved House of Leaves, its unconventionality, its layers.  I could not stand this book.  Make sure you understand this is a book of verse - a long narrative poem (and yes, it rhymes).  I just could not get into it, the language annoyed me, the characters were not interesting to me.  Was there a plot of some kind?  It didn't work for me, which is really frustrating if you know what Danielewski is capable of 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 Visuals are stunning, editing is superb - so if you need a visual guide to the Bible, this is pretty good. Unfortunately, that is where the good ends.  Bruce Feiler sets out on a quest to visit all the biblical landmarks of its first five books, but the trip has an inherent weakness - Mr. Feiler is a skeptic. He is taking a journey of faith but rationalizes each and every step he takes. For example, ascending the Mt. Ararat, where the Bible says the Ark of Noah rested; he wonders where all the waters would have come from in the first place. He wonders - melting ice-caps? In other words, Bruce Feiler is looking for a rational explanation for the Great Flood!   If Bruce Feiler believes that there was a garden of Eden as the Bible says (his very first stop), then he must also believe that God made the heavens and the earth, as the Bible says! If HE can create the Heavens and the Earth by the Word of HIS mouth, HE can also perform miracles. You cannot pick and choose what you believe based on your so-called rationality - either the Bible is true in its entirety, or it is not. If it is not true, then it does not need Bruce Feiler's help to prop up its so-called "stories".   This aspect of Bruce Feiler journey is oft repeated - and very perplexing.  Why set out on such a journey if you do not believe your Guidebook? More examples? Bruce Feiler suggest that since the Sinai wilderness could not support the number of people the Bible says crossed over from Egypt, therefore the numbers must be wrong. How about the Manna being nothing but the gum of some wilderness tree in Sinai? I could go on....but you get the point. After a while, this becomes very annoying.  If you are a believer, this is not for you. I would not recommend it for my children. 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 I read approximately 75% of this book while waiting for a delayed flight in middle America. It is quite simple to sum up: take 100 people who are not employed by Fox News, have ever opposed George Bush, or who have ever taken a political stance that is anything aside from right-wing conservative, and call those people traitors or anti-American.  If you oppose the decisions of the leaders of this country, does this mean you are automatically undermining the social fabric of America? Not in the very least. In fact, many of these 100 people are helping to steer this country away from the downward spiral the US is currently caught in with this dismal administration. Any book with such a title that does not have George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, Condoleeza Rice, and Ann Coulter in the top five is simply an embarrassment to journalism.  Who is this book for? Well, plenty of right-wing conservative folks still think that President Bush is doing an excellent job, we are winning the war on terror, and the country is safer. These are the type of people who need this book. It will make you feel better about the fact that you blindly swallow the bull that is fed to you by the murderers you voted for.  In addition, if you tend to lean left, you should read this book at a library so you can get more enraged at how unintelligent your fellow countrymen can be. But be sure not to pay for it. Don't further line this man's pockets, instead donate the money you would have paid for it to Katrina victims 
 The Author is a neurologist and a Zen practitioner.  His skill at the field of neurology; I will reserve comment until I obtain sufficient information to form a credible opinion.  The information about Zen; is terroble at least in the beginning. I was only able to complete the first thirty pages before throwing the book down in disgust because he tells some things about zen that "just ain't so."  Page 7. "The Zen of which we speak is an ancient sect of mahayana Buddhism."  Zen is NOT Mahayana Buddhism. Zen is neither fish nor fowl.   Zen began in China and was called chan (sitting meditation) Buddhism began in India, when Buddhism was taken to China; the Chinese state religion was Taoism.   Zen is an outgrowth of the two philosophies Buddhism and Taoism. Chan practitioners borrowed parts of each philosophy, and chan was born as a third and seperate philsophy. the  name was changed to Zen after chan was taken to Japan.  Page 8. "Chan also drew some of it's ethical base from Confucianism"  Confucius lived about the same time of Buddha (sidhartha Gautama), and by the time Chan was introduced Confucianism had been replaced with the state religion pf Taoism. It's a mice story; but isn't so.  Page 8. "Thus it gradually evolved into what Kobori-roshi would later describe as a strange dragon with a Taoist torso, Confucian feet and the Buddhist enlightenment-experience for it's eyes.  I documented earlier that Taoism had replaced Confucianism as the state religion before the birth of zen, and I thought the author said on page 7 that Zen was Mahayana Buddhism?  Page 13. "Authentic Zen will not be drawn into such artificial "minn gyms"."  What is a gym? a gymnasium where a person goes to play a sport or to exercize. Zen IS all about exercizing the mind so you can awaken to your True Nature, and silence the monkey mind.  Page 14. "Zen shuns halucinations and dogmatism"  Excuse me Mr. Austin; but one can NOT awaken to their True Nature without going through the mental state called makyo where your mind will generate all sorts of visual AND sometimes audible halucinations.  As I said earlier' I was only able to stand about the first thirty pages before throwing the book down in disgust. The Zen instruction may get better; but I DO know the author puts a lot of garbage about Zen in the mind of the readers.  If you want to learn Zen; start here.  Entry level.  "Taking The Path Of Zen" Robert Aitken "Zen: Lessons From A Modern Master" Katsukui Sekida  Experienced  "Zen Training: Methods And Philsophy" Katsuki Sekida "Three Pillars Of Zen" Phillip Kapleau  For more books check my listmania list for Zen books  Zen was the first meditation system I learned at the age of 12 when studying martial arts.   I am nearly 52 now. I have practised taoist, guided, Hawaiian, Jewish, and several other forms of meditation over the years; but I always seem to find myself wandering back to Zen after a few weeks to months 
 For those that like using these factors in your labor force I suggest you practice the techniques on someone in your family first, see how it effects them when someone plays with their mind - and I don't mean the family members you aren't fond of.  Pick the ones you really care about and apply this strategy on them.  I bet you end up getting a divorce or written out of a will or two, and forget about seeing the grand kids at Christmas.   This book sets the labor movement back to the stone age. It is unfortunate for big business that they must rely on humans to lift the corporate bale and God forbid that they have families and feelings.   It is very obvious that the author has never worked on a frontline with some outrageous quotas to make - no breaks, no air conditioning, not allowed to go to the bathroom without permission, and have to sit there without having any personal feelings about the situation. PUT OUT AND SHUT UP.  That sums up the whole book.  Use fear? Why not go for a whipping stick like they do in other countries.  Yeah, that's corporate progress. Isn't that how we ended up with EEOC and the Department of Labor in the first place?  Steven Covey ............... look away............Dale Carnegie ...... cover your eyes............. 
 One of the worst films ever. I don't know why such a movie must be made. May be studios don't know how to spend their money. Sharnon Stone's character as a mother is very, very riduclous. It isn't worth watching even one time 
 	I read this book on the recommendation of two close friends - both of whom are retired English teachers - and both of whom should have known better.  It is one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Although other reviewers have commented on some of the same things, I think the book is so bad they bear repeating. 	The characters are so thinly drawn as to be stick figures.  The ambitious young professional woman, the used-up poet turned to drink, the insecure young wife, and the brother who main functions seem to be the guy who brings the boat and to be the near recipient of a "quickie on the rocks."  Who could possibly care about any of them?  Without anyone to care about, the author has no chance of developing suspense and eliciting an emotional response from her readers.  	Switching back and forth between two stories in alternating chapters can work as a plot device, but its success depends upon the two stories being brought together in some convincing fashion at the end.  This doesn't happen, and as if that's not enough, the present day chapters are further split by references to the 1873 murder scattered throughout them.  Clumsy and distracting are the best things one can say about the plot development. 	Even though this is a novel, its characters should behave within the scope of believable human actions.  Asking your husband when he first met the woman you suspect he may be having an affair with is believable; asking him the question when you're in the midst of trying to save yourself and family members in a violent storm at sea is not.  There are other examples of forced dialogue, but this is among the most outrageous. 	Lastly, subtlety is obviously not Ms. Shreve's long suit.  The androgynously named child, Billie, is the only one to suffer the consequences of everyone else's failings.  Gee, is this really the death of innocence?  It's about as nuanced as the murderer's ax on Smuttynose.  And how about the danger of  humorless puritans in the face of  real or supposed sexual variations?  Who would have thought it?   	So why has the book been as popular as it is?  It appeals to the world view of certain young moderns:  Sex is the driving force behind all human actions, the brooding woman is the most fascinating creature in view, and a civility devoid of human feeling is to be prized.     	The Norwegian characters in the historical murder prompt one last reaction.   In downtown Oslo is the Vigelund Sculpture Park.  It is populated with the large and brooding sculptures of Gustav Vigelund, a local sculptor whose work is appreciated almost nowhere else on earth.  If one spends anytime there, one comes away gloomy, perplexed, and with the certain knowledge that an afternoon has been wasted.  Save yourself the expense of a trip to Norway - read The Weight of Water instead 
 I'm interested in Australia and the Aboriginals, so when I saw this book I read it. Boy, was I disappointed...  It's not badly written and I haven't read her other book, so I can't compare them, but the whole second part of the book also struck me (like some other reviewers) as a new-age message... Which is something I can only digest in really small portions, so I fully admit that I skipped pieces of the second part !   Another thing that bothered me about the book, was the fact that I was not emotionally involved with the characters. There were little bits of stories, but no real connection between them, or at least it didn't feel that way to me. Beatrices youth was written so detached ! I've read children's book about orphanages that gave me a lot more emotion. The whole puppy story was sad, of course, but for me there was no emotion in the writing...  Marlo Morgan accuses the Europeans of preaching, but she does the same thing. Of course they did a lot of damage to the Aboriginals when the came to Australia, I'm not denying that, but using that to sell books and make money (after the aboriginals protested against her book, she publicly admitted that her first book was fiction and a fabrication) it feels to me she is doing a lot of damage to the aboriginals herself  
 Sat down and saw this one on televion.  Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money.  What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats.   The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional.   This film Awful. 
 this film had a few laughs but it never really got working for me.James Belushi always seems to get the sidekick role even in films where He is the Main star.it is a very cliched type of film but it has some moments 
 Sorry I can't recommend this one.  I bought it USED (thankfully) based on all the nice/good reviews here. I don't think we watched the same film.  If you don't like movies where the characters talk to the viewer, you won't like this one 
 I bought the wireless base with 5 handsets to replace a VTEC 2.4GHz  setup that was being stepped on by my wireless network.  Quite frankly, I regret it.  Sound quality on the Motorola units is extremely poor...sometimes.  And it is not predictable.  I have tried moving the base unit and even sitting next to the base unit when the sound quality is poor and there is little correlation to distance from the base.  The range is vastly inferior to the VTEC 2.4 GHz units.  I can talk on the VTECHs up to 400 ft away from the base and I can't even use the Motorolas in the next room.  It's too bad because Motorola did a good job with the features and functions.  I especially like the blinking light on each hand unit to notify of a waiting message.  The ability to have a local and global phone book is also a very good feature.  Despite the good choice of features, what good is a phone that breaks up and clicks while in use?  Don't buy these unit 
 This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.  Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.  Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention 
 I was in a hurry when I chose this book, now I wish I'd spent a little more time flipping through it. Each section begins with dialogue between Matty and the people/dogs he is working with. That part is completely pointless, and not even entertaining to me. Finally I realized I could skip half of each chapter to get to the meat. Still though, there is pointless ad-libbing through the actually instructions! By skipping, it only took me 45 minutes to get through this book. If you can manage that, there is some usefull advice. However, for such a thick book, I was very surprised that it only covered basic commands. I am still a little confused about how to train my dog! Definately not worthy of "The Ultimate Guide.." title 
 The basic problem is not just that Dr. Walford -- the 120 year diet guru -- died at 79.  The bigger problem is that he looked 90 when he died.  Now that is something hard to explain for the many fervent apologists from his sect.  And it is a sect.  Because otherwise you cannot explain their fervor, despite all the facts which would have stirred up some doubt in you or me.   Yes, Walford was a credible scientist who did some important research.  But in his ill-advised pose as anti-aging guru and in his books, he did himself a big disservice.  Because the truth is, caloric restriction works.  But Walford's regimen to practice caloric restriction did not an does not work.  It is unworkable.  It makes a difficult thing impossible.   And Walford looking 90 at his death was exhibit A of this irrefutable fact.  So buyer beware!  
 Well, it appears I'm one of the only ones to dislike this book, and it's by my favorite author, too!  The only good part about it was that it starred my two favorite people *ahem* characters, Tony Hill and Carol Jordon. There is no real mystery, as the killer is revealed immediately. Despite the opinions' of others I didn't find the book particularly scary, either.   The best part of this novel was when it was over, so that I could start The Last Temptation, the third, and, in my opinion, most amazing, Tony Hill/Carol Jordon novel 
 If you're building a computer based trading system, this title offers some interesting insight.  There are several example trading systems that implement commonly used system features, and these systems are analyzed and commented on.  But this is far from a blueprint--the methods used are too rough to actually use as defined, and the descriptions are very confusing in many places.  Included TradeStation code is a bit easier than most to understand, but that's not saying much.  Every time I read this book, I feel like my time would be better spent reviewing Conway & Behle's "Professional Stock Trading:  System Design and Automation", which covers much of the same material but with considerably more coherance 
  I wanted to read this to learn more about the War in the Pacific. I found some good information regarding the Philippines, but it was hard to read and it did not lay the ground work for the big picture. I liked reading Bataan Diary by Chris Schaefer for a more well documented line of the War in the Philippines and I enjoyed Ghost Soldiers better for easier, exciting reading on the raid of Cabanatuan. 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 I was actually a client of Dr. Shapiro's and he is only interested in one thing-MONEY!  He has made a nice living for himself with his books, but the nutritional education he offers is minimal and his books don't really offer anything but a fad diet.  He drained my pockets, offered me disgusting powders as meal supplements and to top it off I did not lose more than 5 pounds during my entire two months as his patient.  I followed his diet religiously everyday with zero result.  I never reached my goal weight.  I have since been successful after joining Weight Watchers and a local gym.  Trust me, this book is NOT worth the money (not even for free) and I would have been better off spending my money at Barney's (across the street from his office in New York) 
 After opening the weather station and setting it up, I noticed that the numerical display was not readable with missing "characters".  I contacted Amazon and returned it.  Within 5 days the replacement arrived with the same problem.  When I contacted them again, they would not replace it again, saying that the "batch" they have must be defective.  I was not aware that Amazon was selling the "seconds" from other retailers.  A phone call to LaCrosse remedied the situation.  They advised me to send in the defective unit and they will replace/repair it and make sure it is perfect before leaving their premises.  They further advised the "fail ratio" with the problem I had with both units is less than 1%.  Beware if buying this from Amazon 
 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 The author spends so much time trying to be "precious" and "clever" that his narrative is confusing. Where am I? In England? America? Who am I reading about? Huh? Going back a few pages didn't help.  A total disappointment 
 This movie.  My responce; huh?  This may be the most creepy thing ever.  I watched it, and I didn't really feel like I had just watched a movie.  It felt like I had just been stupified in front of a whole lot of people.  Was I supposed to get that?  I was thinking about watching it with my daughter, but I'm glad I decided not to.  She is still a young girl of and ACADEMIC (hint, hint) mind set.  I will always be happy to watch a movie with her, but not one that is this stupid 
 By setting her story in Manhattan, among the literary elite, Claire Messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities," which described upper-class life in Manhattan among the Wall Street elite, so exquisitely that character descriptions from his 1987 book ("master of the universe" and "social skeleton") became part of our vocabulary.   Claire Messud is no Tom Wolfe. "The Emperor's Children" describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of "The Emperor," a famous writer.  Unlike "Bonfire of the Vanities," this book has no compelling narrative - the "voice" shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want, who they need and who they love or hate and why.  Trust me, you won't care.  Meanwhile, the "Emperor" lopes along as a literary lion past his prime.  The characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals (the "Emperor" betrays his wife with his daughter's best friend, the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the "Emperor" etc. etc.) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on September 11, 2001.  But we never learn how September 11 affected Messud's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere.     
 The monographs lack any sort of scientific references.  A true reference manual should list references so the reader can verify the conclusions made 
 The story line wasnt bad but I feel it could have been written much better than what it was.  I just didnt find this book to be very scary and it didnt really get interesting until nearing the end.  The end was pretty disappointing as well and leaves you wondering what really became of the family.  I personally enjoy the horror style Richard Laymon uses in his books.  I felt this book was weak, if you are looking for a book packed with action, gore, and sex this is not for you.  
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I own a Brother HL-1240, so of course I have to use this toner cartridge. But if I had a choice, I'd try someone else's. The problem is always the same. After a few months of great printing (and, BTW, I print maybe a couple dozen sheets a week, if that), a vertical line develops down the left side of every page about three-quarters of an inch from the paper's edge. Don't bother with tech support. They'll tell you to clean the corona wire and drum, which I did a million times to no avail. Eventually I gave up, went out and purchased another cartridge, and voilà, problem solved -- for another couple of months anyway. And then you have to trash the old cartridge which, as you'll be able to tell from shaking it, still has a heavy load of toner left in it. Great little printer; lousy little cartridges. Suppose that's how they make their money, though 
 I read his fist book and this one added very little to the first. It told me alot of stuff that I read in another book about Joey Massino being the last Don. If you read Joe Pistones first book then skip this one 
 The player works as advertised, however I rate it only one star because of misleading business practices.  The package promises a [...] rebate.  When you click on the link to set up your rebate you are required to sign up for a lot of useless crap and provide them with a credit card number so they can charge you [...] per month.  Of course they say you can cancel at any time but this practice is dishonest and there should be some sort of class action lawsuit to stop these jerks from making bogus promises about rebates.    I am returning the 2 players I bought and will never buy anything from Trio again. 
 I usually enjoy Carolyn Hart's mysteries, but in this one there was not enough action and there were WAY too many allusions to other mystery writers and their books.  A few here and there is fine, but it seemed that the references were sprinkled on every page.  Please, Ms. Hart--give it a rest 
 I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan, but this is a weak brew.  Sinatra phones it in (literally - he wasn't even in the same room with his duet partners), and few of the guests offer anything of value.  This is a marketing ploy, not an album - get any of the great Capitol releases from the 50s and learn why Sinatra was the Entertainer of the Century.. 
 You would do better to actually use the money spent on this book and buy a drink on your next cruise.  Horror of horrors, the cruise ship industry is out to make money!!!  Shocking facts such as these as well as those that pay for premium suites get extra benefits and perks (shocking) can all be learned from this book.  The author did a wonderful job of investigative research by basing most of his facts by talking to a disgruntled waiter over dinner.  Thirty cruises is not what I would call extensive experience in the cruise ship industry.  One cruise ship had a problem with its' air conditioner so the author assumes that ALL cruise ships have a problem with air conditioning (or they just turn it off to save money).  This book is a waste of time and money and I will continue to cruise despite his efforts 
 With the corporate legal framework in China changing so rapidly, I am afraid that this book is now already hopelessly out of date. Do beware when reading and one has to check and see if things have been changed 
 I recommend his much witter book on agin 
 We just received this golf set in the mail, and were so excited.  My almost-three daughter and I wanted it to play inside on rainy spring days.  Both handles came out of both foam clubheads the second time we used the set.  We only used the clubs and set for playing golf inside, and the set was used a total of about 20 minutes.  This set is rated for ages 3-7.  I don't see how it could hold up to a seven year old when my almost-three daughter broke it on its second use.  We are sending this set back today, and ordered the Little Tikes set this morning 
 I am very disappointed with the recipes in this book.  I love to cook, love to try new recipes, and bought this book on the strength of others' reviews.  I've tried 6 recipes straight out of the book with no adaptation.  2 of them were OK, but had little flavor.  The other 4 were barely edible, with strange flavors.  Another reviewer said this book is a good spring-board for crockery cooking.  I would definately say that you need to be experienced enough with the crock pot, and spice usage in general, to adapt these recipes to taste, in order to enjoy recipes from this book 
 I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's 
 I bought this book based upon Amazon reader reviews. There was little advice that was other than common sense, and much that was silly at best (for example bring water from your old home). The major points could be summed up: have an open mind, be flexible, bring old things so you are comfortable, and find ways to join and meet new people. There you have it. Save your money 
 Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days.  
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 To be fair, I enjoyed how the book opened up the world of science to many non-scientists. Written in a understandable and comprehensible way, the book brought to life the life story and persuits of many scientists driving to understand the essence of life: DNA.   However, disaster struck when I got into the section about GM foods. It was clear that Watson was a great advocate of the new technology and he is entitled to that view. However, he utterly and horrible abuses the name of science and in his "scientific analysis" of Genetically Modified foods. First the refutes all protestors saying they have backwater knowledge of the area and that they are heavily influenced by politics. He goes on applies the stereotype that ALL protestors are from the non-scientific community and that they are professional trouble-rousers. This is ofcourse not true.   Summary of Watson's "Scientific" analysis of GM foods: He first states that the alternative to GM is persticides. By using Genetically modified crops, farms can stop using the extensive array of pesticides. Watson states that all pesticides are bad and horrible for the environment, EVEN the natural pesticides. This is probably true has me makes quite a few examples how what has gone wrong.  However, his second point is that by using genetic technology, scientists can make a plant product a natural pesticide in every cell. This pesticide found naturally in chrysanthemum can paralyze insects that eat it and they die a horrible death. He seems to say that such a natural pesticide is good because it's fund naturally in chrysanthemum (although he previous said that natural pesicides are just as bad). He offers no counter argument for such technology and goes on to call the European food agencies "lazy" for not embracing such a gene. Readers should think for a moment and consider that although the natural pesticide incorporated into all the cells of corn etc is not dangerous, there are many other examples where other pesticides are incorporated into our food. In such a case, no matter how much you was a plant, you can never wash that pesticide away! Science needs to be applied with extreme caution. 10 years of research might not reveal what dangers some chemicals do to us in the long run. For example, when X-ray was first invented, no-one knew of such dangerous so people took x-ray pictures of their full body for fun! Not surprisingly after 30 years these some these people developed horrible cancers as a direct cause of the x-rays being taken. The implementation of a new science must be made with extreme caution and the public has every right to be suspicious of it.  Another argument made by Watson is that we have been manipulating genes for centuries in the cross cultivation of plants (therefore GM is safe and anyone saying it is playing good is a hypocrite). However, I must remind you that GM is completely different from genetic engineering where scientists have complete control over what they want to produce. In some cases scientists can have finer control over cross cultivation, but I must remind  you that when our ancestors selectively breeded different species of goat wheat to make the wheat we use today, it took many generations of patient work. Now with a new technology, we can suddenly create a new species out of thin air and plant them with our nice machines. Therefore if we created something that wasn't good and didn't know about it, the results would be devastating cause we would be dealing with a mass of new species all around the globe instead of just our backyard.  Watson also claims that GM foods will help solve the world hunger problem. This is not the main and state aim of GM foods, it is merely a side agenda of big companies like Monsanto who is more concerned about getting a constant supply of income from farmers. I must remind you that GM foods is propelled by capitalism. Capitalism is good until it something messes up such as in the great depression. However, when genetic engineering is concerned, far worse catastrophes can occur if technology is too rapidly implemented. What if the "terminator gene" made all the plants on earth unable to reproduce in 60 years? Such inter-species mixing is rare but it does happen. The world hunger problem cannot be solved at the cost of world annihilation. The technology will eventually mature, but maybe in a few hundred years not a few years.   There are many more examples where Watson plainly ignores the counter argument and just makes a biased counter attack for GM foods. I must remind readers to read this book with extreme caution. GM foods are not as safe as the book makes it sound and you are not an uneducated myth believer you object to GM foods 
 In the years since September 11th, 2001 many authors have tried their hands at the 9/11 novel, with all of its delicate subject matter, and thus far they have met with only limited degrees of success: Jonathan Safran Foer, Julia Glass, Wendy Wasserstein, and others have centered novels on the pre- and post-9/11 era, and now Claire Messud takes her turn with "The Emperor's Children," a novel set during the months preceding and immediately following that horrific day. The titular 'emperor' is Murray Thwaite, a prestigious journalist living the quintessential Manhattan lifestyle: fame, money, parties, and the adoration of literati and socialites alike. He has cultivated an image based on truth and integrity, although those charactersitics are notably lacking in his actual person. His 'children' are the people immediately surrounding him, captivated by his presence and hoping to coast on his celebrity with varying degrees of maliciousness. At the novel's onset most of them are suffering from some form of paralysis about their life's direction. First and foremost is Marina, Murray's daughter, who seems hopelessly trapped in a prolonged adolescence -- afraid that if she grows up and tries to make her way in the world she will be unable to live up to her famous father's reputation (the thought of disappointing him is particularly troubling to her). It is easy to forget that Marina is 30 years old because she is quite deliberately written like a high school aged socialite. Then there is Murray's nephew, Frederick "Bootie" Tubb,  who has grown up in awe of his distant uncle and comes to Manhattan after dropping out of college to ask him to be his mentor. Bootie, an intelligent but overly philosophical and idealistic young man, quickly becomes disillusioned with Murray (for who could possibly live up to the lofty expectations that celebrity produces?), and becomes determined to expose his uncle for the charlatan he believes him to be. Complicating things further is Ludovic Seeley, a smarmy Australian businessman who has come to Manhattan to start his own magazine -- and aims to shake up the existing journalistic order by dethroning the reigning king. Ludovic is such an arrogant cliche that all he needs is a mustache to sinisterly twirl to be an outright cartoon. Lastly, there are Marina's best friends: Julius, a gay hanger-on from chilly Michigan eager to make an impression on the New York social scene, and Danielle, who is presumably the humane center for the novel to pivot on, but suffers from such ludicrous Ally McBeal-esque crises in her love life that her credibility is dangerously suspect after the first hundred pages. The characters are uniformly pretentious and are alternately mildly and seriously annoying, but Messud manages to propel her novel forward despite their intrinsic unlikability because, as shallow as they are, they are all multi-layered, complex, believable people. The many threads comprising the narrative are expertly weaved together for some compelling character studies (even if you wouldn't necessarily want to hang out with the lot of them). But that willingness to stick with their stories is, at least for me, predicated on the belief that they will be changed people by the novel's end. They aren't. And while the narrative is expertly crafted, Messud has a penchant for overusing commas in her prose that becomes, increasingly, irritating, as she uses them to stretch out her sentences, and to add separate thoughts, or descriptive elements, and even, occasionally, dialogue, so that they feel like run-ons, like this one right here, this example I've devised for you, but are, for the most part, technically, grammatically sound, even though you may have to re-read the most trying sentences a second time, just to figure out what she is saying, without letting all of her distractions get in the way.   Messud does an admirable job building suspense as the chapters go by and September 11th draws near. There is a great degree of foreshadowing to be found, some directly indicating that September will be a month of great change, what with Ludovic's magazine set to launch on the 13th and a wedding to take place, but naturally none of the characters can predict just how fateful the month will prove to be. The sense of impending disaster looms large in "The Emperor's Children," and it is quite unfortunate that the novel loses steam when tragedy actually strikes. Indeed, 9/11 is almost anticlimactic when it occurs, serving merely as a catalyst to wrap up everyone's story lines. It was unbearably annoying to endure the outrageously selfish way that the characters responded to the attacks and the gross loss of life that they witnessed. In the late afternoon of that day, after the towers had fallen and Manhattan's skyline was irrevocably altered forever there wasn't a lot of soul searching going on in the hearts and minds of these characters. All they care about are their own petty problems and how the terrorists ruined their carefully planned calendars (I felt like throwing the book across the room in disgust when Ludovic had the audacity to go on a tirade about how his precious magazine's launch had to be cancelled). I live in the tri-state area, about an hour and a half away from Ground Zero, and the events of that day and the intense mourning that followed will be with me for the rest of my life, and what Messud has critically failed to capture is the way that 9/11 actually brought a grieving city closer together for a brief moment in time, and how for once people put aside their petty complaints to work on the larger issue at hand. I remember crying at work alongside my stunned colleagues and the reassuring hugs we gave each other, the phone calls I made to -- and received from -- people I hadn't even spoken to in months or even years, just to make sure that they were all right. I remember the eagerness with which people helped each other out, whether the need was great or small. This incredible outbreak of brotherly love earned the admiration of the world, but it is conspicuously absent from Messud's telling. One character uses the tragedy for personal gain career-wise, one uses it as an excuse to wallow in self pity (not for anything to do with 9/11, mind you, but for strictly personal reasons) ... I don't want to give too much away by outlining the callous behavior that offended me so much, but in my opinion it was woefully inappropriate. I had hoped that tragedy would change the Emperor and his Children for the better, but I was wrong. And it's a shame. Messud is definitely a capable, promising writer -- but this isn't her finest hour 
 My son is a big Spiderman fan and so I ordered this new Animated Series.  He told me upon viewing it, that this was computer-animated.  I think it stinks and if I had known this before I opened it, I would have returned it and got my money back!!! Give me the old animation any day 
 I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.  
 I love my Dyson vacuum because it works better than any other vacuum I've ever owned and I have spent more money on other vacuums and I have been disappointed until now.  But the floor attachment is an overpriced piece of junk and I am being polite.  Mr. Dyson should have made it differently because I am afraid of scratching my wood floors with this attachment 
 Like I said, avoid this book, at all costs!  I've been doing stand-up for a few months now, with a fair degree of success, and I thought I'd get this book to brush up on some basics.  What a mistake. It reads like a geometry textbook for Christ's sake!   `Create subject (a):  attach Subject (b); where (b) is an opposite of (d), but only when (x) is a variant.  Let's not forget (y), which goes like this:  "Why did I waste money on this rotten book?" `  If you have money to spend, and want to be a stand-up, just buy some DVD's and learn by observing other comics, and not by wasting your time on a book that reads like a physics lecture. 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 For years I have avoided Jodi Picoult novels and if this one is typical, with good reason.  For my book club, I am plowing through the nauseating minuate that bulks this novel to over 400 pages.  The constant, brief shifts in first-person narration are too fast and give views on characters, such as a judge who likes show tunes, that are irrelevant to the novel at the expense of more fully developing the title character.  The first-person narration works for important characters but otherwise I think the author is using an easy narrative device to propel the action of her novel, which is, even with this technique, infuriatingly slow and has the effect of jarring the reader every page or two as one must determine the narrator yet again.    Also, the focus on the child-custody battle removes attention from who I think is the most interesting character--the child Faith.  If one can get past the didactic symbolism of the name Faith White, and the constant phrasing such as "here is a story about faith" (p. 275) followed by "he'll do whatever is in his power to make sure I keep Faith," (p.291), which makes me cringe at each repetition, the child seeing or hearing God is, to me, the most interesting aspect of the plot but one that receives little attention.    Overall, I think this novel is heavy-handed, overly descriptive and replete with such obvious symbolism and detail it makes my eyes hurt. The characters never seem real and I never sympathize with any of their easily predictable reactions and emotions, but find the potential of the plot is never fully realized in any engaging way. Try a different novel- many others dealing with religion exist that are far better written and much more interesting 
 Read the reviews and checked out the book.  What's wrong with the narrator?  Since this is a "fictional" biography, the narrator can wiggle his way in and out of funky --I mean, funky situations.  I sense a neurotic writer who is probably insecure and a bit on the "edge" (not cutting edge, but psycho-edge), who used this book as therapy.   Yeah, the writer intrigues at a real elementary, base level. . .  The hapa is represented in such a pathetic way, I was wondering if Fulbeck was resurrecting the tragic, neurotic,psycho mulatto (the main character of this book is reminiscent of Soaphead Church of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye. . . Pathetic.  Bad representation of hapas.  Get over yourself!  Please don't speak for all hapa guys, just your "fictional, biographical" self.  Can we move into the 21st century with more realistic representations of hapas already! 
 Some people writing reviews of this book have criticised Mary Buffett for cashing in on her former relationship to Warren Buffett. I don't have a problem with that. Everyone who has written a book about Buffett has done it to make money. What I found interesting about this book was that Mary Buffett has not included a single example of her using the information in this book to buy a company's shares in the stock market and make money. Mary Buffett doesn't provide the name of one company she made money on - or her reasoning behind buying it. We all know Warren Buffett can make money in the stock market. Mary Buffett doesn't show us that by using the information in her book she has ever made a dime.   The book is written for a reading level of about junior high school. The book might be helpful to someone that age just getting interested in investing. If a parent has a child that age getting interested in the stock market, this might be an OK present. There is some good information in chapter 16 on the characteristics of excellent businesses and in chapter 18 on where to find information on companies that have shares listed on stock exchanges. A key point made in the book is there are two separate parts to successfully investing in the stock market: 1) identifying excellent businesses 2) only buying shares of these companies when you know the prices are cheap.     Warren Buffett's company is Berkshire Hathaway. The best place to learn about Warren Buffett is the Berkshire website. It's free. The quality of the man's writing on business and the stock market (almost) matches his skill as an investor. If you are really interested in learning about investing you will appreciate and enjoy reading Warren Buffett's letters to shareholders posted for free on the Berkshire website far more than this book.    
 I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie. 
 The review that stated that Salisbury writes about 'The first 90 Days' is correct!  Leningrad was a siege and a stage for several battles arround its outskirts and... no map! No geography! What the author does most is to describe the hardships of his "peers": "poets", "writers", "artists", "playwrights" and "intelligentsia" like they were la créme de la créme -(and this says a bit about the author). The Germans are barely mentioned (not that I am a fan!). "Guns" and "cannons" are they the same? "tommy guns" instead of submachineguns... The most infamous close air support pilot of all time, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, the one that hit the "Marat" is not mentioned, but insignificant "intelectual" bums with silly hats do.  Bad book by a Pulitzer prize winner. I do not recommend this book to any military historian. It does have plenty grim "stuff", much to the delight of the author's adored "intelligentsia" 
 This book is so outdated. All the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980's and earlier, which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past. There are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books 
 We all know Repbulicans don't care much for the environment, and now we're chopping down trees to give more praise to a man whose son's ambition is paid for with American lives. Why was this book written? Are trhe Bush-Kochs suddenly strapped for cash?    The book, if you can focus on a father and daughter that aren't dripping with wealth and power, is good enough. I like GHWB, voted for him, but the lovefest is going way overboard.   And as for the $500 billion dollar aircraft carrier (the tenth and final Nimitz-class supercarrier) just commisioned and named after George, Sr---it was absolutely wrong to do so. The man CVN-77 should have been named after is Admiral James B. Stockdale. Admiral Stockdale, a distinguished naval aviator and test pilot flight instructor, flew over 240 carrier-based missions, earned 28 combat decorations, and after being shot down over North Vietnam in 1965, spent 8 years as a P.O.W., 4 years in leg irons, 2 years in complete darkness, tortured and beaten daily. It is amazing that he didn't go blind after 2 years in darkness, malnourished and sleeping on concrete. Despite all of his pain, his primary concern was always the welfare of his fellow prisoners and that they received enough food and proper medical care. Stockdale even organized a hunger strike when one prisoner was denied medical treatment. At one point, he knew that one of his fellow P.O.W.s was guilty of an infraction that would possibly lead to that prisoner's execution. His captors knew Stockdale knew who the guilty prisoner was, and tortured Stockdale without mercy. Knowing there would be more torture and fearful he would crack and give out the prisoner's name, Stockdale attempted suicide. Rather than bear the thought of one of his fellow prisoners being executed or subjected to the pain that was inflicted on him, he tried to take his own life. Stockdale's suicide attempt was unsuccessful, yet in the attempt, was the ultimate statement about Admiral James B. Stockdale, that he would rather have died than see a fellow American soldier suffer pain or death at the hands of their captors. That maybe true about GHWB, but perhaps not so about our current President. Adwarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1976, Admiral Stockdale died in July of 2005. Even GHWB would tell you that CVN-77 should have been named after Admiral Stockdale.   Why isn't that in your book, Doro? On October 7th, 3 days after your book was released, you christened the USS George H.W. Bush, CVN-77. It rained that day. So much so that the ceremony was closed to the public 
 IT WAS VERY TOUCHY. WITH NEW BATTERIES, IT GAVE A LOT OF ERROR MESSAGES. BUT AFTER A FEW TRIES, I GOT A READING 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 [...]In this ideological driven appraisal of cultural upheaval, Stannard gives little consideration to what is widely considered the chief culprit in the disappearance of native populations: smallpox. Even the spread of disease is regarded as de facto genocide, a claim that is as outrageous as it is spurious.  Still, one should read this account if only to take in, albeit with a deep breath and more than a few bites on the proverbial lip, what now passes for scholarship in so much of ethnic studies and American history courses these days on college campuses. It deserves a hearing simply because it has become an entrenched view and because it is promulgated as fact. Paradoxically, in demonizes the European explorers, missionaries, and settlers, Stannard has fallen into the trap of Montaigne and Rousseau's "noble savage" with, of course, the "savage" stricken from the phrase.   Some of what Stannard describes and derides is true and deserving of fuller consideration and I will leave it to you the reader to discern what details those might be in this work. But much must be dismissed as little more than consensus or agenda-building in the highly cynical discourse community to which he belongs. Suffice it to say that if one is seeking a far better balanced perspective, and one without an ideological bent, one would do well to read historian Charles Mann's "1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus" published by Knopf of New York, a more discerning publisher 
 This 2002 copyright book I bought (thought I was getting most recent version) is not a good book. Dont buy it. Way too much fluff.   PDF File on CD didnt work at first. Eventually got it to work, but shouldn't an adobe file work wihtout having to contact tech support 
 I ordered this for my son's up coming 1st birthday party.  I figured he and his little friends can sit in there to play.   I received the package this morning and I was in for a surprise.  First of all, 50% of the balls (it came with 100 balls) were half inflated.  The shell of the balls are so soft, and somehow the air inside was not full enough; thus half of the ball looked crushed.  Then, I thought, " fine, I just go buy another 100 balls to mix them in. no biggie".    Then, I inflated the pit for my son to play in. No more than an hour later, the main part of the pit deflated by almost half and the plug was still securely attached.  So, there must a hole somewhere.  This toy is totally unsalvageable.  I had to make a call to amazon and they have authorized the return of this product for a refund.  This is a very low quality product.  I didn't expect kiddie toy like this will last long, but one hour is too short for me. I don't think I will buy anything from this Ball Toyz company in the future either.  I think their balls are too flimsy. 
 This book just drowns in the satire it tries to create.  It takes extremely long just to get to the real plot of the story and throughout that setup it's just the same thing over and over again: Meet a drunk, stupid noble; Befriend him; and buy his dead souls.   If you can get past that, the book becomes a downward spiral of unspired "wit," as people like to call poor commentary on a society 
 If you hope to read accurate, objective and well researched information about anything having to do with vitamins, nutrition, or alternative medicine, AVOID any book with Stephen Barrett's name on it. He is so biased that it makes you squirm, he has no credentials in the field, and his information is extremely poorly researched and inaccurate 
 The content is so elementary that this book cannot be considered a serious reference work for writers. Many of the "Common Errors" seem to have been made up in order to complete a targeted page count. If you already know the difference between "chunk" and "chuck," and know when to use "next door" instead of "next store" to convey your intended meaning, you can pass on this one 
 Well... I know kitchens in the USA are usually larger than the ones in Europe but even then... most kitchens shown in this book are 3 to 4 times bigger than my current kitchen. The book does NOT give you planning tips, no clever cabinet interiors, just pictures of finished kitchens, not even info on how that finished kitchen came to be.  So if you are looking for clever ideas for making the most of small kitchens, DO NOT buy this book!   Petr 
 I'm a big fan of dummies books, have used them for years, and recommend them to students. But this one is horrid. I'm an experienced programmer with some OOP experience, and I could not follow what he was talking about. The examples where parts were completely unexplained did not help. I don't buy books so I can reread sections three times and still not be sure what the author meant. I am looking elsewhere to learn Java, and I recommed you do the same 
 I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.  Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.  Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.  Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it. 
 If you want to read one of the most pretentious books on progressive rock whereby the writers try to sound smart discussing a wide range of social philosophers completely out of context then this book is for you. I would recommend not wasting your hard earned mony and picking up a classic like Armando Gallo's I Know What I Like or Sid Smith's Court of the King Crimson. Both amazingly enjoyable and unpretentious reads.  
 The basic idea of this book is that problems in marital relationships are caused by childhood psychological wounds.  Those wounds are unconscious, but, according to the author, we all had them.  Many of the exercises (e.g., listening exercises) would be helpful, but they are basic, and many of them are not really based on the theory.  The author says repeatedly that we were "whole" humans in the womb, but we were damaged as children, and we need a healthy marriage to make us whole again.  Some of the examples in the book reveal a patriarchal mindset.  For example, in the section about "rewriting scripts" for arguments that a couple has repeatedly, the author suggests two alternatives that give the man what he wants, but no options for giving the woman what she wants.  But if I object to that, I suppose that it must be because I was wounded as a child 
 Firstly, I'd like to say that seeing this happen to yet another beloved (and rightly so) series. In the world we live in today, popularity can almost become a book series' downfall, rather than its success; as a series gains popularity, the author is put under more and more pressure to keep producing, resulting in books like 'Jarka Ruus' that have lost all of the magic and inventiveness that made their predecessors so wonderful and enthralling. Yet the series' biggest fans will continue to read, regardless of quality (or lack of it) and hence the series usually continues its inevitable slide into the unremarkable. I hope that the once-great Shannara series can be brought back to its previous level, but if that becomes impossible it will almost certainly have been this book that doomed it.  I recently read the last trilogy, the Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, and found myself impressed still with Brooks' mastery of his genre. Especially the ties to a now-lost technological past were incredibly intriguing, and the story was certainly far from conventional. Perhaps in retrospect characterization was a bit off, but the trilogy concluded excellently with a powerful redemption that tied to Shannara's very beginnings.  As a result, I had high hopes for this book. However, nearly everything that made Shannara great has been lost in the rush to get this book out to the public. The plot fails to impress, resorting to rehashes of previous books that, although with the potential to be intriguing, come across mainly as tired cliches. The characters likewise fail to capture that three-dimensionality so evident in Brooks' first three sagas. Especially weak is the 'love story' involving Pen Ohmsford, a plotline that, laughable from the start, quickly becomes tiresome.  As a result of this, I may have to reconsider whether it is worth it to follow this series as it continues. Perhaps if Tanequil (book two) and Straken (book 3) regain the spark, I will return to my love of Shannara, but such a spark is difficult to recapture once lost.  However, even a disappointment such as this can hardly destroy the appeal of Brooks' earlier journeys, all of which are quite magnificent. If only he had been given the time and restraint to make his latest equally so 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 Jon Bon Jovi should definitely stick to singing because he's a horrible actor, but that does not even begin to describe how terrible "Vampires- Los Muertos" is...as horrible of an actor as Jon Bon Jovi may be, "Vampires-Los Muertos" is an even worse movie.  Vampires, that's a laugh...this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse.  The original "Vampires" sucked too, but this one is even worse folks!  Definitely one of the worst so called "horror" movies of all-time and that my friends is saying something!!  Can you believe some people call this a horror movie...well, you can imagine what I call it...yes sir, I just call it rubbish and that's being very kind. 
 Like a lot of old Big Star fans, I greatly looked forward to this album and eagerly read all the pre-release info I could get my hands on. After playing it all the way through the first time, I put on the latest Teenage Fanclub CD to clear the air. How ironic is THAT??  After a few more spins, my reaction is more measured, but still only "Two Stars." Things start off pretty well, with "Dony," "Lady Sweet," ""Best Chance" and "Turn My Back on the Sun" all warranting repeat listens. Pretty good EP if you add "February's Quiet" to those four and stop there. Enough's been said about "Love Revolution" so I won't bother to repeat, but I think the bigger problem is that most of the remaining tracks feel like filler. "A Whole New Thing" and "Do You Wanna Make It" sound like they might have been thrown together at a Thursday night rehearsal for a longer Friday night gig than the band had expected to play. Competent, yes - but way below these guys' standards. "Aria, Largo" sound like something from Day 1 of classes at the School of Rock. And "Makeover" would perhaps be amusing as a hidden bonus track, if the album itself were full of more gems preceding it.   There's half of a fine album here. If I were Mr. Ryko (IS there such a person?), I would have told Alex & company to come back with five or six more good songs. I wasn't expecting anything quite as good as "#1 Record" or "Radio City," but I WAS expecting a good deal more than this. The best one-word summary I can give for "In Space" is - "LAZY."     
 This hardcore conservative did not enjoy this book.  The book is filled with a wealth of eye-opening information on significant people that I did not know but should (like Hugo Chavez's new best friend, Noam Chomsky), but the reading is so laborious and draining that I cannot recommend it.  It has none of the light-hearted fun that we often get from Rush Limbaugh.  Rather, it brought to mind the dark experience of listening alone to Michael Savage in a bad mood after dark.  The cheeky title is misleading - this was a joyless book to read 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Not a well thoughtout and often incomplete in many areas of today's telecommunication. Its volume does not justify its contents. Recommend Newton's telecom dictionary instead. 
 I ordered this item based on the great rating it got, yet when I received it I was unimpressed and found the size measurements to be wrong. I ordered a medium based on the manufacturer's notes yet when received found I needed a longer one. After researching how to return, since it came with no information on this, I found out you can not return this product from this store. I wanted to warn everyone before they purchase.  
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 Only", the second single from "With Teeth", has something in common with its predecessor-- its of limited value. I picked it up and was pretty disappointed.  The single itself, "Only", isn't one of the ones I particularly enjoy on the album-- its got a nice enough funky bass line and drum beat, but Reznor's sing-speak "Down In It" styled vocal grates and the piece doesn't particularly hold my interest. Certainly it lacks the immediacy of "Down In It", and I'm generally inclined to want Reznor to look forward, not backward.  The b-sides aren't much better-- the DFA mix of "The Hand That Feeds" is yet another remix, this one pretty much a full techno mix. It's quite different, replete with an odd panting sample that gets somewhat irritating as the piece never ends (it rambles on for well over seven minutes). The live version of "Love is Not Enough" is the only saving grace on the single-- while its not one of the better songs on the record, its decent enough, and live it got bigger. The arrangement is the same, but its more direct and in your face.  For the casual listener, skip this one. The fan will be buying it regardless of what I say, but it's in line with the recent singles, not the older (and superior) ones 
 This book was a big disappointment.  I picked up a Carly Phillips novel last year at the airport and was pleasantly entertained.  I've read and enjoyed a couple of others since.  This book, however, isn't one of them.  This is a rerelease of a book Ms.Phillips wrote for Harlequin Romance years ago, and is now trying to use her recent popularity to sell once again.  Let me say, she's improved in her writing immensely since she wrote this one. The book drags on and on as we wait for the inevitable coupling between the main characters.  The internal dialogue is repetitive and the formulaic "romantic barrier" preventing the two characters from immediately committing is flimsy at best.  The language is often stilted and the plot contrived.  Thankfully, Ms. Phillips has learned to write a better book than this.  Unfortunately, she's decided to foist her less-than-stellar early efforts off on her unsuspecting public, leaving at least this reader with a bad sense of having wasted my time on a crappy book and disappointment in the author 
 When I opened the package, I found the filter box seals (one at each side) were broken, an indication that it was not new. I thought it's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear. When I opened the filter box, three pieces, the ring, the glass and the circular clamp, jumped out. While it's bad sign, I still thought it's ok as long as I could put them together. Well, the glass was not clear, as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper (I never saw any filter or lens in that shape  before!). Before to ship it back, I did try to put three pieces togather (so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box). Guess what, the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends couldn't meet!!! I couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen, since it was from Amazon, not from some unknowns of eBay (actually, any eBayer will have to worry about the Feedback). I was really shocked that Amazon shipped that garbage to its customer!  Hope this is just a random incident and Amazon does have a very easy return practice. Otherwise, I would not buy anything from Amazon

 This book takes the position that increasing technological infrastructure and investing in higher information technology does not increase productivity. The argument is complete hokum from beginning to end; however, it is very convincing due to the large amount of evidence presented and the prestige of the pseudoscientist promulgating it.   Most of the evidence presented exemplifies the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, which should be obvious to any logician or scientist reading it. However, several more subtle fallacies are also present. The subtlety comes in by virtue of the author failing to define `productivity.'  First, the author measures productivity using GDP. This is analogous to using the physics definition of work when you ask a man who's spent all day trying to tip over a mountain, "Why are you so tired? The mountain hasn't moved, therefore you haven't done any work!" GDP is a measure of output in terms of dollars. It does not measure work done, just how much was sold.   Second, the author uses return on assets to analyze investments in new equipment. Now, I'm no expert in finance, but since assets is in the denominator, using ROA in the way this author does (the ROA of the firm, not the investment decision) would systematically understate the positive effects of these investments. Net Present Value or Internal Rate of Return would both be much better measures.  Third, and this is related to the second point, the author compares firms to what they were in the past (before investing in technology) or to other, dissimilar firms. The relevant comparison is between a firm's current profitability and what the current profitability would have been if not for the investment. The common form of this reasoning is: XYZ Corp. made a huge technological investment in 1986, and experienced no rise in productivity (as measured by ROA). This ignores the possibility that the whole industry became more competitive, and failing to invest in the technology could have led to bankruptcy.   In a related issue, he completely ignores rising standards. His argument is equivalent to, Finding Nemo did not make significantly more money than The Lion King. Therefore, enhanced technology did not increase productivity. This is incorrect because productivity is a measure of work done over time, not money made. If animators tried to make a film with the graphics quality of Finding Nemo by hand, it would have taken several orders of magnitude longer, if it was even possible! The fact is, the animators, like so many workers in society, get far more done today than they used to, they just don't get paid anymore to do it, which is actually an argument for the value of technology.  I gave up on it shortly thereafter 
 First of all, pot doesn't make you aggressive. It's absurd to think that a person would spill the beans about their sexual fantasy in such a mean way after taking a few puffs from a joint. The argument after the pot smoking seemed too contrived, just like all of the dialog and action in the movie. Things only seem to happen to lead you into the next scene. It's ludicrous to think that a man is going to go off in search of a prostitute because his wife THOUGHT about having an affair.   Certain things seemed to be thrown in for shock value--Nicole Kidman on the toilet wiping herself, the nude, large-breasted patient that Tom Cruise was examining (what exactly was his specialty anyway?), and the father pimping his young daughter. Other things were thrown in for no reason at all: The patient whose father died and pathetically professed her love for the doctor. The prostitute, Domino, being diagnosed as HIV positive.  Another annoyance: Cruise's character always walked around saying "I'm a doctor", like that means something in NYC in the 21st century. (Sure, I'll let you into my store after midnight!)  The movie took us on a journey and then left us hanging. Too many questions were left unanswered: How did they know the doctor didn't belong at the party if everyone was wearing a mask and why was he such a threat since no one at the party could be identified? How did Nicole Kidman have a dream about an orgy the same night as the real one? How did the mask end up in the bed? Was there really foul play involved in death of the junkie prostitute and the quick exit of the piano player? What the hell was the point of this movie?   P.S. London only looks like New York City if you don't live in New York City 
 If you're starting from zero this is the guide. A couple of nuggets but otherwise, a boring read 
 Having recently become a Don Johnson fan after seeing his marvelous performances in the "Miami Vice" tv series, I was very much interested in seeing him in other roles besides the never-to-be-forgotten 'Sonny' Crockett. Unfortunately, "Paradise" was a disappointment after my excitement to see Johnson and his wife at the time, Melanie Griffith, star together in what was supposed to be a 'family' movie.  Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith play Lily and Ben Reed, a couple torn apart after a terrible tragedy. Their love and affection for each other has died out and they live day by day hardly speaking to each other, hardly acknowledging the other's existence. That is, until a good friend's son, Willard Young (Elijah Wood), arrives in town as their summer guest. Will the Reeds finally rekindle their lost love for each other, and will young Willard, with the help of a country girl, Billie Pike (Thora Birch), learn to not be afraid?   The acting was well done and I have no qualms with any of the actors. Johnson and Griffith, by then seasoned veterans of the trade, play their roles with lots of heart and it's easy to feel for each of their characters as they strive to grasp some sort balance in their tumultuous lives. As for the younger stars, Elijah Wood and Thora Birch are also quite good for their ages. There are some awkward moments where though they are trying very hard to capture some dramatic moments, their inexperienced youth comes in the way at times. On the overall, it might be said that Birch may have been the better actress (both youths receiving 'Young Artist Award Nominations', though Birch is the only one who takes home the award for 'Best Young Actress').  I think my main problem with "Paradise" is with how the plot is presented. The plot is fairly good except that it is stretched too thin so that you really can't put your finger on what the message is. And when a good plot is stretched thin, too often do directors put 'unnecessary' subplots throughout the movie. But instead of doing it to make the movie flow better, the subplots in "Paradise" seem to burden the film with tediousness.  Not only are some of scenes out of place, they are sometimes 'cringe-worthy'. To give an example, the director wished to show a sense of every day life of the people in town. Often at times, Willard and Billie are left to their own devices to find their own amusement. And their 'amusement' consists of stealing a boat, doing dangerous stunts, and being 'peeping Toms', spying on Billie's sister and her boyfriend. Their spying on Billie's sister and her boyfriend at an 'intimate' moment was the most disturbing and disgusting. I found it totally unnecessary and made me wonder what kind of a director could ask a young actor and actress to participate in that kind of scene?   As mentioned in the above, this is NOT a family movie contrary to what some reviewers have mentioned. Besides some disturbing scenes with Billie's sister, there is also some profanity. And on the whole, the story deals with mature themes.  If taken in the right direction, "Paradise" may have been a good movie. Parents would have enjoyed watching the Reeds fix their broken relationship while kids might have been able to relate to Willard's struggles with the different kinds of fears he must face. But unfortunately, "Paradise" doesn't put too much focus on fantastic Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith while Willard's part in the movie wasn't quite uplifting or interesting. The story also ends somewhat disappointingly. There is just a hint of the 'hope' of what's to come for the characters and then immediately cuts to the closing credits. In my opinion, I would rather have seen how that summer changed their lives for the better and witnessed that change.   All-in-all, "Paradise" was never a big hit for a reason so if you're looking for a good drama to watch with the family, I recommend these films instead: "Mr. Holland"s Opus" - Starring Richard Dreyfuss, this is a great film about the life a music teacher and how he touched the lives of many. "October Sky" -An extremely uplifting movie about how a group of boys strived to fulfill their dreams. (Some strong language so maybe to be watched with older kids. 
 This has to be the worst piece of crap that I've ever heard. The keyboard notes sound like a dying duck or something of that nature. It sounds awful, but the batteries are good. If you need to get 6 AA batteries buy this keyboard. I think the batteries are worth more than this thing. Luckily I got this for free with my order so it isn't all a loss. I needed batteries 
 omigod, did this garbage really pass for "hot" 2 decades back? director albert magnoli has zero sense of pacing, editing, acting, story telling, etc. and prince is as bad an actor as ive ever seen. no, i take that back -- ive seen apollonia (who herein makes her role in "falcon crest" look like lilian gish)! i will not comment on the musical score; if you like it, more power to you and go buy the album. but a movie where clarence williams, III gives the strongest performance? well, thats not a movie i ever want to sit thru again 
 The rubber does not go around the screen, and is generally poorly designed. The bit of sticky backed plastic thet supply to go onto the screen leaves bubbles of air on the screen. I shall now be ordering the official Apple one in the hope that that is a lot better than this thing. Hope that helps 
 In my only other review of a Coben book('Gone For Good') I was concerned that he was relying too much on formulaic plots(guy loses girl, goes through hell, uncovers 'deep, dark, secret', and big plot twist at the end reveals all.) Unfortunately, every one of those characteristics is present in 'TNO', and the result is a terrible novel! It's not even good enough to be classed as a 'fun junk food' read. The plot is full of idiotic developments that are meant to be 'surprises', and ridiculously convoluted action/chase scenes. Yet another aspiring screenplay masquerading as a book. I won't even attempt to explain the plot. I suppose the only good thing I can say about the story is it didn't turn out to be another hokey 'serial killer' drama, after all...though that would have been an improvement! There are far too many cases of characters 'keeping secrets' and double-crossing each other...but the 'big secret' revealed at the end is the worst of all, destroying the slim chance that the reader might actually salvage something from this train-wreck.Plenty of other readers have already commented on the ridiculous supporting cast, which seems to be a Coben trademark, alongside his New York settings and poor plotting, so I'll skip them, and hope 'Hester' doesn't mind!  Read if you're a Coben fan, skip if you actually like stories that make sense and lead somewhere 
 This book did not offer enough resouces for parents.  It was also pessimistic in terms of the outcome for dyslexics.  It was very helpful in terms of identifying characteristics that are not often associated with  dyslexia,yet it still appeared to be very general in catergorizing these  characteristics.  One of the methods for teaching reading skills, however  was very helpful but other methods should have been given as well 
 I hated this book!  It is such a disappointing series after reading The Other Bolyn Girl which I absolutely loved.  This series is centered around a incest - which is detailed graphically in the book(s).  Very disappointing 
 This book tells us how heated and extravagant delusions can get when the deluded happens to be a combination of philosopher and cognitive scientist.  As long as something readable is produced on a topic with popular  interest, all is well.  Only real philosophy and science are left behind.  To put it simply, Churchland is an incompetant philosopher who knows very  little science; but he appears to be more interested in philosophical  questions than even the greatest philosophers and uses more scientific  jargons in his writings than the best scientists 
 I have to disagree with the other reviewers.  As someone just trying to learn how to apply makeup I didn't find this book helpful at all.  I especially didn't like the use of drawings instead of pics.  You can draw  whatever you like but it's not the same as looking at a pic of someone who  is supposed to have small close set eyes... you all know what I mean.  I  don't think this is a good book for the novice and that includes the skin  care tips.  Wash your face twice a day and don't use drying products.   There that should take care of the cleansing routine and I have saved you  some money to boot.....  I expected better than this 
 This is a book by JA Jance?  This book took a potentially good storyline (plot) and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style, which is UNLIKE JA Jance.  This book seemed to be to be written for a young-adult reader audience.   I had to force myself to read it all the way through because I must admit, I was curious as to the conclusion, but I did not derive any pleasure from reading this book.  A waste of time 
 My father used Dobson's methodology as a license to strike.  If you wish to die alone in a nursing home, I suggest you listen to those who worship hate and violence.  There is not a day that I don't dream of lashing my old man with a studded belt to punish him in return, and am contemplating not having children to let the cycle of violence end with me.  God bless America, we really need it... 
 I wanted to like this book: but often asking writers such questions brings on words that are not spontaneous and that though they may be competent in intellectualism, they are impoverished in beauty and in gutsiness, which is the kind of writing that truly sings. Since time to read is limited for most persons, it might be good to read the original materials and forget about the rehashed commentary. I would far rather see a diamond than read about one 
 Don't waste your time on this book, there are more valuable ones out there. First of all, what has she DONE to the fabulous story of Shahrazad? Practically torn it apart and sewed it back together with very rough stitches. I read this book trying to get away from the stereotype some writers have of typical "weak" women (I am partial to strong heroines with wit) and therefore thought another retelling of Shahrazad would be just the thing.  Well, it turned out I was wrong and this book just had the stereotype I was looking to get away from. If you want a strong heroine, if you've been disappointed by this book and how it portrays Shahrazad, go read Cameron Dokey's version (called "The Storyteller's Daughter). In all, that is a much more satisfying read 
 Movies For The Blind is one of the top ten best hip-hop records ever made. In Stoney Lodge is perhaps one of the most empowering/gut wrenching songs about bipolar disorder ever recorded. Agent Orange, while not new for the disk, is an excellent use of A Clockwork Orange imagery. The list goes on and on. So why then did this album fall flat? On one hand Def Jux is warping him to fit there new "politically conscious" label image and turning him into an Eminem knock off (which is ridiculous because Eminem bit cage's style hard) just listen to peeranoia, and on the other Cage is not the angry twenty something he once was. Cage is now on the thirty year old patient who wants to get sober, and get his life straight. In that sense the album works, it is pretty honest at times. Yet I feel that this somewhat contradicts what happened with Movies. He makes the apology, "everything I said on Movies because of my buzz." This hurts his credibility as an artist. And a line like "this time around I'm just one of you fu8king depressed kids." who is he, Slug? I don't feel the album lived up to the impossible standards set by Movies, yet I am interested to see where he takes this new angle. Overall, it's worth a look, but nothing special 
 The blanket worked, for 3 weeks. Now the controller just keeps blinking E. It wont reset, it wont warm. I cannot return it to amazon, It's been longer than 30 days, as I purchased it ahead of time as a christmas gift. I wont do that again 
  I read the mixed reviews of this book but decided to try it anyway because of the catchy title. Wrong. I give it a 0 stars. The book was almost embarassing to read - the authors try so hard to be funny and witty but they come across as vapid, silly women trying to make a buck by maligning their own religion. It was awkard, like sitting in front of someone telling bad jokes.   I am Episcopal so I do not share the indignation that the Catholic reviewers felt.  However, this book was boring, the authors tried to hard and did I say boring?   Ms. Anderson needs a new occupation.  Wonder what her parents think of this book? And,how did it ever get published? 
 I was caught up in the early chapters, but when the author lost his focus it was total disappointment.  The book became a laundry list of names and theories; many unrelated to the subject at hand. As a teacher I liken this to many of the Master's theses to which I was subjected. 
 Did Danielle really write this?  It seems like it was written by an adolescent girl.  I thought it might get better but it never did.  I'm glad this was a library book 
 I was looking for something more detailed on different laws that someone in HR should know.  I felt this book was too broad and the way it was written was a little hard to read.  If you are a business owner trying to get the basic "dos and don'ts" this may work, otherwise I would look elsewhere 
 Whether the book tells you exactly how to do a mission or not you'll still end up failing it a few times before you actually complete it. Most of what is written in this book is a no brainer and easy to figure out. The only good I see from the book are possibly different routes or secrets here and there but even those you can get online for free so there is no point wasting the money 
 This guide does not come close to comparing with Lonely Planet.  It is poorly written and gives little or no information about museums and city sites other than their address and hours of operation.  The map is also poorly done and it is difficult to use in locating restaurants and museums.  Buenos Aires is an amazing city so I suggest buying a worthy guide book, not this one 
 I bought this book because of the great reviews.  I plan to send it back.  Very silly and not worth the bother 
 The title of the book is misleading, because the book is comprised 90% of recipes, NOT techniques, wit& wisdom etc. It is not a guide, it is a recipe book. If you've decided to go macrobiotic and have access to ingredients like rutabaga and arame, this book provides you with many recipes, but for me it was totally inapplicable. I was expecting the guidelines for macrobiotic eating and cooking that I could apply to different ingredients at hand and thus was very dissapponted 
 These earphones are well put together and at the price they could be outstanding. The volume control alone make them a steal. The problem is that being behind the neck there is no adjustment for size. You can't wear them while relaxing in a chair because when you lay your head back, the earphones try to rip through the front of your ears. Add to this that there is no foam cushioning to the phones themselves and they are hard plastic circles than insert into your ears and it makes for PAIN.  Unless your ears are large enough to accomodate 1/2 inch discs inserted into them SIDEWAYS (like inserting dimes into your ears edgewise), you will not like the feeling. Add to this the fact that the speakers face forward instead of into the ears, and you have the problem of having to raise the volume higher than necessary.  So instead of a well designed product you have one that is badly designed from every aspect. These could be great earphones if Koss would make them adjustable, reduce the size of the speakers and turn them 90 degrees so they direct the sound down the ear canal and finally add some foam padding to cushion the speakers. The quality is excellent and the volume control is substantial and well made, not flimsy like most that I have seen. A company like Koss should know better. 
 The book didn't include but one of several hundred older records i had 
 I have enjoyed reading Family Fun Magazine, but unfortunately have only received 2 issues.  I have not received any further magazines and am completely disappointed in the service.  I will not order another magazine from Amazon because of this poor service.  I tried to get a refund and have only gotten the run around.  
 The fact is this guy does not give the most solid advice for directing.  He rips on Spielberg, and basicly calls martin scorsese a Hack.  He tells you that a good idea is to sleep with your producers to secure you job, just a lot of things that are not that helpfull.  He does have some good things to say, but you have to dig through so much crap that it's not really worth it.  There are plenty of other good books out there, and this would be one to pass on 
 I have to disagree with most of the comments made by the other reviews listed so far which is why I felt compelled to write my own review.  This book was VERY hard to get into and the character development was poorly lacking. I do agree with one reviewer's comment on her use of complex words.  I found that very frustrating because they added nothing to the story line and I got tired of referencing my dictionary for meaning.  BUT...  The "mystery" was weak and the ending was very abrupt and choppy.  I also thought the ending was very unrealistic -- even for a work of fiction.  And why, why, why did she have to continue to use most of the characters' full names throughout the book?  There were also way too many characters to keep track of.  Maybe she was trying to create more suspicion but it only created more confusion. Finally, the attempt at a side plot with one of the characters was poorly executed and the twist with him was not a surprise. The only good thing about this book for me was that I got it from the library.  Sounds like Ms. Graham has it going on at CNBC... I think she should stick with that career.  
 If you're seriously interested in why China wants war with the United States don't waste your money on this book. The authors don't come close to answering the question. The story line is a combination of Tom Clancy, Indiana Jones and Dr. Strange Love.A good portion of the book is devoted to military cowboys intent on blowing up anyone and everyone with weapons that only exist in the minds of Pentagon planners.  The authors take several cheap shots at previous political leaders and future candidates. Don't waste your time on this boo 
 The quality of this tea is far below that of other matcha's I have tried. The packaging alone is careless and does not bespeak of the tender care that is typically given to green tea, particularly the fine powder. I would not purchase this product again. The quantity that I do have, I will cut with other better tea rather than waste it. If you do try this product, use care opening the package, because the tea is inside without any barrier to keep it from spilling 
 My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., "People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them." That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo 
 The story is set in late 1943 but is unbelievable due to bad costumes and worse acting. A decent plot exploring the relationship between man and his enemy may be enough to keep the watcher awake, but maybe not. 
 This book just describes situations that come up at work but not how to manage peopl 
 If you want to learn about Paul Feig's sex life...read this book. There isn't much humor in it, but you learn what a lame-o he was 
 This book is vey difficult to understand and learn from.  It's explanations are too abbreviated with not enough information on each code.  Also, not all codes and conventions are included, and it reads like a novel, meaning not very descriptive or illustrative.  Too many paragraphs and sentences 
 I have just started in archery and this book did not answer my questions about the sport of archery.  I wanted a book to tell me about target shooting, but this book is aimed at experienced hunters.  So, if you are an experienced hunter looking for a way to get around target panic this might be for you; however, if you want to shoot at a stationary target buy something else.  Much of the book deals with shooting in a traditional fashion, such as not using sights (line up along the arrow and cant the bow) and how to let the string roll off your fingers.  I shoot with sights and I use a mechanical release (this is a string holding device and lets you release the arrow after pulling a small trigger).  The book just doesn't deal with this type of shooting.  
 This book was almost unreadable it was so fraught with misspellings, lack of punctuation, and typos galore.   At one point, it even refers to Dinah Lance (Black Canary) as Diane Lane.  I think all they did was run a spell checker on it.  I've read some other books by this publisher and they all seem to have that problem 
 I received the wrong speakers.  I ordered the penguin speakers and got the monkey speakers. They were a Christmas gift for my niece who collects Penguins. I e-mailed the company several times with no response back. So, I will never order from this company again, will take my business elsewhere 
 After reading all of the reviews, I thought this would be a good, insightful read for someone who is interesting in the culinary arts.  Instead, it's like listening to someone tell you a long boring story and you don't have the heart to stop them.  He goes on about little projects like finding the cheapest subsistence diet, the difference between ketchups, and all the ridiculous diets he has been on.  Very boring, inconclusive, and uninteresting.  Also, I wouldn't trust anyone's palette who likes Diet Coke as much as this guy.  $14 bucks wasted 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 Author doesn't have anything in this book which not already available free of cost on the internet.  It was a total waste of my time and money procuring and reading this book.  May be useful to people who can't search items on their own online. Admire the market who knew how to title useless books like these! 
 These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance 
 I read this book once. It was allright but too dark and racy for me. I like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts I liked some but I liked Merrick better. BOOK WAS OKA 
 I read this book after coming across it on a "most important books ever" list. I found it very hard to get through. Approximately half-way through the book I found myself counting down the pages until I finished it. This is not a book to read if you're looking to be entertained, however if you're looking for a good bit of culture/history I would think this would be a decent pick. Some of the passages involving the main character and his love interest are very well written and beautiful to read. In fact, I re-read some of the passages again just for the majestic quality of the author's writing. As a college junior with little knowledge of or interest in African culture I did not enjoy reading this book, however I may try again in the future to see if I can get more out of what others have deemed a very important and worthy novel 
 De Soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights: it's incredibly difficult for poor people (specifically, recent urban migrants) to get legal title to their land. As a result, the poor make "extralegal" arrangements, squatting on and using land that neighbors (but not the government) recognize as theirs. But because they don't own the land, they can't get a mortgage on their house to start a business, electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services, the government has difficulty taxing them because they don't have a legal address, and so on. And so on.  It's a very important point but de Soto oversells, arguing with exaggerated (and oft-repeated) ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor.   He occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work. For example, he has helped businesses in Peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal, and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes: a useful bit of empirical information, but those gems appear all too occasionally.  Before reading this entire book, I recommend going to the website of de Soto's foundation (the Institute for Liberty and Democracy at www.ild.org.pe) and reading the main point there (in one tenth the words) 
 I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked.  And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like.  If it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all.  I guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah 
 Can't improve on the text of REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE.  He was the dominant political thinker of the last quarter of the 18th century in ENgland.  His reputation depends less on his role as a practising politician than on his ability to set contemporary problems within a wider context of political theory.  The introduction by L.G. Mitchell argues this point congently. Mitchell's intro appears in the Oxford University Press edition.   It's cheaper, too.  
 Root shock was an okay of a book. It was very one-side; Fullilove never considered the other point-of-view. She also attempted to capture the reader's attention by supplying the readers with full size pictures that took up an entire page; however, she failed to get our attention. The urban renewal process is interesting, but she took so much credit for supplying the information, when in reality, it was the interviews that supplied the information about the process of urban renewal. The book was okay, but it can be skipped. 
 Healthy? I don't think so. Every meal she uses a lot of olive oil, butter, and salty additives. then writing a recepie for "Hamburger Salad" Basically garden greens from a bag, and a couple fried hamburger patties placed on top of the greens, with cheese on it. Oh my...Quick, easy and "Healthy" meals. I don't think so 
 The review on the cover of the DVD reads "A snappy, sexy thriller..." I must disagree. This was the most unsexy, and unthrilling movie I've seen in a long time. In my opinion Ashley Judd doses not fit this roll, it's almost comedic.  Twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting. Seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had. I have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production.   The film's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination. My vote? Just okay, nothing to write home about 
 I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.   When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing.   That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 Having lived in Rome for several years as an American expat, I am constantly being asked about guide books and have read all of them.  And Rick Steves is really the worst ever!  It is the perfect guidebook for the single digit IQ teen on the "Do Europe" thang, but when I actually lived there after having bought this wretched tome and studied classics and art there, I realised how much of this book is just American stereotypes of a few days spent in tourist traps in the Eternal City.  And Rome does not have good food?  Rick, either your palate is as dumb as stone or you need to live with the Romans for a while and get nice and fat like those of us who came as skinny American kids and matured into solid young men under the Roman sun 
 The usb and power cords come out very easily which ends up being dangerous for the hard drive file system. The power cord kind of sags in the socket.  
 This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 I have been a witch over 13 years and I am a big fan of Charles Leland. This book I am not. It has very little truth to it. Mr. Leland got the text from someone who wanted to abuse the craft with lies. This is a Christian book. That is put in a way to please the church. Witches do not belive in satan, though to this book. The horned god is satan himself. Aradia is said to make comments that would have gotten her killed on the spot. I NEVER threaten the goddess. Again we have many areas saying we do this. There is not enough room to go through it all. You can get free copies from websites all over if you must read it. If you do think about what it is saying and you can easy see it for what it is. A preverted vesion of what should of been sacred 
 I agree completely with the previous reviewer--this licorice does not even come close to the usual quality of Haribo candy.  This stuff is dry and hard, and it leaves your hands sticky with waxy grease.  And the flavor--what little there is--is just weird: kind of a fake floral.  NOT recommended 
 Phyllis Chesler shares what she perceives as an alarming new trend among leftwing groups. However, the groups that merit alarm for becoming newly, or in reality more visibly anti-Semitic, have always relied on antagonism and violence for motivation. Workers should hate their bosses, women should hate men, blacks should hate whites, etc. We're not talking about hatred in the abstract, but deep-bred hatred that calls for action, strife and turmoil. Someone please correct me, but it sounds as though the author was all for the "movement" as long as the hatreds were directed the way she prefers. Now that the beast has unleashed a little fury towards her group, she doesn't appear to have second thoughts about the worthiness of her causes, but rather she sounds as though she wishes that she could direct the hate back to where she would prefer it to go. Also, I found the writing extremely flawed in many places. And, there don't appear to be references to back-up all the allegations of "terrorism", i.e. many acts appear to be random criminal violence that just happened to involve Jews. My sympathies to those people, but all of us are faced with such incidents 
 Dry and textbook like. I also own the 2001 edition and didn't notice any significant changes or improvements 
 Nada que objetar a este album. Ballads es fantástico de principio a fin, pero, ya está bien de reediciones con el único fin de lucrarse un poquito más. Hace 3 años teníamos la versión en CD. Después sacan la versión remasterizada. Ahora la que contiene tomas alternativas. Mañana será una nueva mezcla, pasado la que contiene la versión hip hop y dentro de cinco años la que incluye el autógrafo de la madre de John Coltrane. Ya está bien. 7 tomas alternativas son demasiadas tomas alternativas. ¿Tan mal está el mercado para tener que hacer ésto? 
 A friend recommended Sue Grafton. So, I read her latest, and after the first chapter I nearly put it down. The ridiculous love life of an 87 year old stud almost did it, but then the crap about his family...well, I wanted a mystery, and all I got was soap. Fortunately, I checked the book out at the library, otherwise I would have asked for a refund 
 I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here.  The characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them.  Everything was very 2 dimensional for me.  I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun.  I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement - something I'd read already and knew he would enjoy.  But that's just my opinion - obviously not shared by many 
 This so-called expose fails the test of critical thinking. Riding on a wave of "lets help the disadvantaged fringe", which amazingly now includes the middle class (?), the author explores multiple examples of exploitation of victimization across multiple sectors of the economy. An intelligent reader will soon learn within the first 50 pages that this is the same "nickel and dimed" stuff warmed over. Is there no originality? Are all corporations really the bad guys? Is business only about exploitation? Are books of this genre only for copycat professors who have lost all imagination? How about a book from someone who understands how our economy and businss works and can offer really insightful solutions, not this misguided drivel, on how business and consumers can work toward mutual benefit. As it stands, pay no more than you would for "fish-wrap" for this book 
 I love Sylvia, but I found this to be a waste of my money 
 First thing-the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 Caesar games out there.  Having said that-this game had a major bug right at the release.  How is that possible?  Is it unreasonable to expect a U.S. company to produce a flawless product?  Probably not, but Tilted Mill has some of the the best pros in the industry.  Basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess. The advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer.    Far better to go with CivCity 3 
 Bev Harris, Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the Twenty-First Century (Plan Nine Publishing, 2003)  The first thing that needs said about Black Box Voting is that Bev Harris has some things to say that people certainly need to hear. And since the release of this book, things certainly haven't gotten better; electronic voting machines of the type Harris talks about in this book continue to proliferate, and politicians continue to use the system to their own ends. (Anyone shocked by the recent Rolling Stone article about the theft of the 2004 election simply wasn't paying attention; those of us in Ohio were well aware of Ken Blackwell's underhanded tactics throughout 2004.) There's a lot that the average American can learn from this book. However, it has one massive flaw that will keep it from ever being effective: its presentation of those facts.  Technical books, as a rule, should not be written by non-technical people. Harris makes some mistakes that are especially confusing given that she does seem to know, sometimes, what she's talking about; for example, she explicitly defines the term open-source as it relates to software, and the definition is correct, but every other time she uses it in the manuscript, it's misused (open-source software, for those of you who don't know, is software whose source code is generally available, and is usually built and maintained by a community of developers, most, if not all, of whom are unpaid; Harris mostly uses the term to refer to Diebold software that was left on a server accidentally, was never meant to be available to the public, and has never been built or maintained by anyone but Diebold employees and Diebold-maintained consultants). She also mistakenly uses the terms PCMCIA card and memory card interchangeably despite noting in at least one place that a PCMCIA card can also be a modem. I've never seen a modem with its own memory before.  Aside from that, there's the issue of Harris' prose style. Nonfiction writing, be it boring or readable, always maintains at least some minimum standard of professionalism. Harris is quick to throw professionalism to the wind too often here, and as a result comes off sporadically as the schoolyard bully chanting nah-nah-nee-foo-foo at teachers while across the street from the school.   Both of these shortcomings hamstring what would otherwise be a very important, valuable contribution to the world of the political expose. I hope there is eventually a second edition, one that has been attacked by an overzealous editor. That book, if it is ever brought to light, could well change the face of American politics. As it is, it's far too easy to write it off as the ravings of a crank. * 
 I generally read about 100-150 books a year, and of that, there are usually only two or three I don't finish. This is one of them. I picked this up intrigued by the Du Maurier name and the premise of a union between the United States and United Kingdom. Alas, around halfway through this last of Du Maurier's seventeen novels, I realized I was bored to distraction by the tepidness of the satire and generally lackluster prose. The story is set contemporarily (it was published in 1972), and like so many of her works, in Cornwall. The idea is that a former stage actress of some repute and wealth has retired to a large mansion where she has taken in a series of orphan children, allowing them a great deal of freedom to develop their imaginations. To a certain extent, this character seems semi-autobiographical, and the way the children are raised parallels her own relatively unrestrained upbringing. One day the household arises to discover American planes flying overhead, marines landing on the shores near the house, and an announcement of a political union between the U.S. and U.K. This is apparently in response to some kind of European Unionish fiasco that is left to the reader's imagination. The real point seems to be that Britons will never never never become slaves, nor even the little brother to America's big brother. The household's first sighting of the Americans occurs when a nervous Marine shoots a neighbors beloved dog, which sets the standard for the subtlety of satire. Soon, the elderly lady is predictably leading a local revolt against the occupation, American soldiers are brawling with locals over girls, and so on. The problem is that the Du Maurier can't seem to decide if the story is supposed to be a satire, a farce, cautionary, realistic, or what. And since none of the characters were developed enough or interesting enough to care about, I realized my time might be better spent reading something else. 
 Okay, this story throws in a bunch of Goddess/feminist/mother-rite stuff, but the main female character is nothing more than a stupid girl. To sum up the entire series, she does not care about the land she is ruler of at all. She abandons the land practically and I really can't blame some of the characters for trying to overthrow her. The only way Miles can make any of her female characters seem powerful is to make the men weakminded and half retarded. Tristan is a pansy who happens to be good with a sword. And while Tristan and Isolde is supposed to be set in the dark ages, Miles makes Isolde disgustingly wealthy as far as jewels go. She also makes all Christians look like vindictive zealots. Not to mention that although she is so obsessed with the mother rite and plus she is a princess/queen, she will not stand up to her husband. Don't waste your money on this book about a selfish, stupid young woman who is in love with an equally stupid guy 
 Although well written and researched, Gail Sheehy's book was a major disappointment. Having experienced many years of discomfort, especially on location, I assumed that somewhere in 'Understanding Men's Passages' I'd find advice on how to treat my chronic hemorrhoids. Alas, not a word. Clint Eastwood made the same mistake, but he cured his by actually reading the book in one sitting 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 I've read 300 of the 362 pages and I can't be bothered to finish.  Not particularly well written.  The secondary characters are un-developed and annoying... in fact, the same can be said for the main characters.    I don't care what happens to them.  I don't care about finding out what the "mystery" is.  I can't figure out how they could possibly have fallen in love.  The author just springs it on you.  It's a bit insulting to the reader, in fact.    The heroine is passive and whiny... "[spies (or whatever) are following me and I'm going to do nothing about it except wait for them to spring on me at every tourist site and "ruin" the tourist experience for me.]"  This is my first book by this author, and unless I forget her name (it's a very bland, forgettable name) and accidentally buy something by her again, it is the last.  I'm really glad I only paid a buck for it 
 This book is a poor application of the KM subject. It has non-sensical terms like "knowledge management server" that would only make sense to a Boeing engineer.. 
 I happened on this book while just browsing in a bookstore and because I have enjoyed Cornwell's writing in the past, bought it without reading any reviews.  I have learned my lesson.  I was totally disappointed and felt that the story had absolutely no depth and was poorly written.  She (Cornwell) would have been better off to trash this one, as I am sure that this book will give many of her fans a real cause to pause before buying another of her books. A real waste of time and money. 
 Amie:"I would say this book is a little less than average. I enjoyed the book Angel Medicine much more. The Angels seemed so much more peaceful and loving in her previous books which makes me think they are merely a projection of what the author is feeling at the time. Are they angels or inner thoughts and how can one really tell?"    I have reason to believe they are far more tilted towards herself than angels.  Whether reading this book or going to her site angeltherapy.com you will find a community message board where anything that you write that does not support her position, she or her admin team will immediately and high handedly delete.  I've seen postings on this site that says if you question her or her affiliates the admin will take you down.  Now consider the topic of this book & what she is writing about.  Thats not exactly Angelic, is it?  The reason I mention her site on angeltherapy.com is because you clearly see further evidence of what Amie says --  That the writings come far more from her than from Angels.  Why include all this on Amazon.com?  Very simple!  A genuine message from Angels is something I myself would like to read.  Having explored the evidence I really dont think this book is as much Angelic communication as much as it is Doreen communication.  If your looking for Authentic Angelic communication you may have to look this book over a little more carefully 
 I should have listened to the people who wrote negative reviews, this book is a complete and total ripoff, it tells you nothing , save your money and buy a bottle of wine instea 
 Though I'm a great fan of Gleick's other books, I found Faster annoying in the extreme.  True, it is replete with fascinating facts and insights.  After a couple of chapters, however, many of its fascinating facts and insights -- not infrequently organized into endless prose lists -- began to feel like so many bricks to the skullcap, waterdrops to the forehead, ...  Enough was enough was enough.  I listened to Faster (audiotape) on my commute to work.  Mornings 3-8 felt like Groundhog Day.    F(un/interesting 15 page magazine article) + C(affeine) + OCD + T(ime) +/- P(er-word-payment) = Faster.              
 I've been wanting to own this set for some time now and I'm sad to say that I was not impressed at all. The DVD quality for all 3 films is good as far as the picture goes but the sound is mediocre. The first Sabata is OK. Adios Sabata may be a little better but The Return of Sabata was just lame. I like Lee Van Cleef so I guess I had high expectations. I didn't care for many of the same characters making repeated appearances as different people. I watched the 3rd installment last night and I was fighting to stay awake! If you can find it cheap, get it just to say you own it. Otherwise avoid 
 This book's greatest flaw is, undoubtedly, its predictability.  It naturally has the descriptive and creative style of Scott, but the plot moves too logically from high point to high point with very little between.  There are very few "plot twists," and those which do occur are far from surprising.  From the book's outset, the story proceeds rapidly to the obvious tragic ending and seems to repeat regularly.  This ending also seems hurried and completely unbelievable.  The characters are poorly developed and, rather than seeming independent and realistic, seem to be nothing more than puppets forced to follow the extremely depressing plo 
 First off, let me start by saying that I love...LOVE...LOOOOOOOOVE Blues Traveler.  I have all of their official releases, and literally over 100 additional CDs of live shows (they allow taping).  I am one of those guys who, even if the live show recording doesn't soung very good, I will crank it up, and strain to listen to BT, because I love their music.  With that said, this is the worst album I have ever heard of theirs.  There are a few decent songs, but even most of those are ruined by horrible effects...they sound like kids who just learned how to use studio effects, but don't know how to do it well yet, so they just turned them on at random.  Missing from this album is EVERYTHING that makes a Blues Traveler album great.  The songs are not well written, and sound like they were just thrown together.  Popper's lyrics, usually brilliant, are pretty mundane.  The vocals, usually amazingly powerful and expressive, are often distorted due to bad effects, and never really show off what Popper can do.  Chan (the guitarist) is almost non-existant, and songs like Rubberneck just sound empty without him.    I'm glad that the band had a good time recording this album, but I sincerely hope that this was just a dud, and not the start of a horrible trend.  This album is the most disappointing thing I have ever heard from a band I love so much 
 Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.  The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas.  I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs.  Anyone got ideas? 
 This study Bible will be helpful only to those who are seeking a liberal or "progressive" interpretation. Not recommended for evangelicals or those of a more conservative point of view. For example, the commentator on the book of Mark is a well known gay and lesbian activist at one of the most liberal seminaries in the world 
 I read in Manson's bio that the singer for this band was a groupie of his. And it shows. This cd is a clean, more innocent version of Manson's first cd.   Her voice is nice and catchy, but the content wont appeal to many peole over the age of 16. This was a cd that was made to get quick appeal and then fade away just as fast 
 Be aware that this can opener cuts the lids off cans below the ridge creating 2 sharp edges...on the lid and on the can itself.  Otherwise, it is a good concept for anyone who may have difficulty in using manual can openers or for those who need the counter space 
 Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.  For example, 3c: "Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."  If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!  Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use?? 
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 The author reinforces gender stereotypes with a "humorous" ending where the girl and boy exchange clothes, resulting in a teacher exclaiming to the boy about his wearing pink pants.  (You can tell it's sexist when you realize that navy blue pants wouldn't have worked.)  Imagine how gender non-conforming children feel to have their likes ridiculed in this way 
 I bought 2 of these drives to set up a RAID1 array (mirror) and one of them continuously has errors, causing the array to be degraded. I called tech support and they said these drives do not support RAID. Big let down, I have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more 
 I haven't read any of the real Robert Ludlum before, but I don't think I will be starting if this is his style. The action scenes, with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts, are perhaps better suited to a 90 minute movie instead of a 400 page book. The weapons-catalogue padding is comical at first, later frustrating. The childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places. We know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest. Perhaps most disturbing is the book's overall 1950's style racism  in which the Americans are dashing, multi-skilled warriors for good and the Russians, Ukrainians, even Germans are all ugly, inhuman or quickly dead. Whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water-tight, the reader is always a step-ahead of the characters. As other reviews have said, suspense and mystery are left absent 
 First off, 9th WOnder's beats are sick. All of the albums that he handles most of the production, except the mostly dissappointing (to me) Minstrel Show, have consistenly tight production. THis album is no excpetion. But Skyzoo definitly DOES NOT bring back NYC. I can tell that he made this ablum in 3 days because most of the verses lack flow (i.e. sounds like every wack mainstream NY rapper; Faboluous, GUN-IT, Jay-ZZZZZZ). Accolades from Jay-Z and Nas don't mean anything, as they are merely hyped up one album wonders. If 9Th made these beats for Kaze again, MURS or Buckshot, or somebody like MF DOOM (a true NYC lyricist)or maybe bring back Jeru tha DAMAJA?? then maybe I'd have an album I can listen to for more than three days and be able to get high to like only a real album can.If you like 9th wonder, and you can tolerate someone like Skyzoo who isn't that bad but should have put more effort into this ablum (maybe a week would help)then it is a must buy. If not, check for the instrumental and make your own 3 day high 
 We bought this humidifier as the low-cost alternative when our kids were sick this week.  It's horrible!  We're returning it today!  When this unit is running, it leaks water between the reservoir and motor units.  Overnight it leaked enough water to completely saturate a folded up large bath towel I placed under it!  Two days later & the towel is still wet!  Additionally, the unit is noisy, spits out water droplets with the mist, and is very difficult to clean (oddly shaped water reservoir makes it impossible to completely empty the unit).  If you need a humidifier, buy a different product 
 We bought this AP to use with WPA Enterprise using a radius server and basically, it dosen't work. At first we couldn't get it to communicate with our radius server at all. We resolved this by changing wireless channels until one worked. Then authentication worked, but we couldn't get an address via DHCP. We couldn't resolve this so we assigned a static address, but couldn't pass any traffic over the link. Unfortunately, we found the Linksys support to be friendly but ultimately useless. There only suggestion was to try different firmware. Once we had done this, they couldn't help any more. So basically, they might say it works, but it doesn't. Tried a different manufacturers AP, worked straight away. 
 I recieved this item in a timley manner.. I found that I believe that I have been shipped a used or returned item.. Unlike the other pan I recieved this one had obviously been opened and had the attaching parts for the handle opened with pieces missing.I am very disappointed as they clearly state that returned items would not be accepted if opened. 
 Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.  The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.  It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane 
 For such a great actor, I expected to see his best films-not a collection of his so-so films. The movies are good, but it's a huge diappointment to true De Niro fans 
 If anyone has ever done any research into the fields of congnitive psychology or memory, you'll realize how incredibly awful this book is.   "If you are unable to remember any specific instances [of abuse] like the ones mentioned above but still have a feeling that something abusive happened to you, it probably did." Page 21. How awful is that? Completely misleading as well. Any memory such as this can be implanted into someone's mind, when they had NO actual abuse in their lives.  Furthermore, "If you think you were abused and your life shows the symptoms, then you were." Page 22. Need I say more? This is utter trash. Completely unbased by scientific findings or even common sense.  Avoid this book at all costs if you are a serious victim of child abuse. Realize that it is very easy, as humans, to recall past instances of violence, trauma, and abuse, when they actually NEVER happened.   It's sad and morally disturbing to see a book such as this in print. It's even more disturbing that people are accepting this book as a true "self-help" book. I encourage ANYONE thinking about buying this to reconsider and do a lot more research into their past before conjuring up false recall of past memories 
 What happens if the kids start from the last question and works backwards? Anyone knows how to get in touch with the authors 
 This french press made a delicious cup of coffee. The problem is that it is advertised as a "3 cup" coffeemaker. I returned it and will get a larger size 
 Any other book you buy on forex is going to be better than this one. You'll be left wondering how it is that the author could possibly feel that this is going to benefit anyone (except herself). A real disappointment. If I could have rated it less than 1 star I would have 
 I bought this looking for real world applications to meeting girls/women looking for sexual fulfillment.  The gist of the book was a plug for richer men able to "buy" escort services pricy enough that sexual favors afterwards were expected. I wanted real world applications on how to score with the girl next door, the hottie down the road that I would love to get into ther pants and show her a good time, the sexy secretary at work, and so forth........this book did not deliver on any of this.......the only basic for these was to shave, smell good, dress nice......etc.........didn't need the book for that.....have returned it for credit 
 The blurb writers and reviewers of this book must have been compensated because never have I been so disappointed in the advance word regarding a novel. Yes, the writing is poetic, but the story is aimless and the characters not defined.  In quantity and quality this is a very thin book 
 Here's another classic example of a reason so many people dislike science. How can we expect people to put up with the bad language and lack of motivation and application? Textbooks ought to set an example of good writing. The authors do not pay attention to the reader. They just bundle a few points together and call it a book. There's no desire to rise above the median 
 This book was used as a text in my philosophy of music class.  The professor chose the text because she knew that we would be opposed to his views.  He barely deals with vocal music at all, claiming that it is not "pure music" because it has text.  When dealing with opera, he feels the "problem with opera" is the fact that it is not cyclical.  He mentions that when opera was first introduced that emotions were thought to be cyclical, and opera to the best of it's ability tried to accomidate that.  However, it the mid 18th century that was discovered not to be the case and it was realized that emotions are linear.  Just because the history of music has cyclical background does not mean that with this discovery it should remain as such.  Linear and cyclical writing are tools used by a composer to convey certain emotions or to help define an event.  Overall I felt Kivy was too verbose.  If I were not a music major, I would have found it hard to truly understand what he was talking abou 
 Be aware that "journal" means lots of blank pages.  Not much of a bargain for all that space.  Could just as well have been a pamphlet 
 Let me just start by saying I really like math, but this book did not help me to learn biostatistics at all.  It doesn't explain the issues and equations very well and it has absolutly no answers in the back to check with yours, that's a whole other book...and that only has answers to the odds.  Perhaps this would be a decent book for anyone who already has a handle on the subject and wants to learn more, but if this is your first exposure to biostatistics, like me, try another source to learn from, this book makes a difficult subject near impossible 
 I used to like this film back in the late 80s but after purchasing it, reading the book and watching it again I realized that there isn't much to say that is redeeming of this film. Sure it's low budget, but the story and characters are so cheesy and NOT in a good b movie way. I guess this film will still have it's fans but after reading the book (I dont normally compare books to films because its downright impossible to compare) I found the characters just not that likeable and the ending is very ridiculous. For a film to achieve cult status isn't too hard if its a b movie but whether its a good film or not is the real question. As for me I rate this low because I find it atrocious but for it's fans, the ones out there that REALLY love this film and call it a "classic" I must say I hope some day they remake the story with better actors, effects and plotting 
 Only 1 or 2 songs worth multiple listens.....And who is the Rabbi-dude in the middle of that one song?  Sounds like a parody.  
 IF YOU LOVE GOOD MUSIC YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THESE GREAT ENTERTAINERS!  WONDERFUL SINGERS AND VERY TALENTED MUSICIANS.  IF YOU ARE A FAN OF CELTIC WOMAN OR OF THE BEST IN CELTIC MUSIC THIS DVD AN CD ARE A MUST TO OWN!!  
 GOOD: Bought watch Feb 1 2007 BAD: First watch showed up dead - not working. Battery?  GOOD: Amazon replaced next day BAD: Second watch showed up dead- not working. Battery? GOOD: Worked fine when I had the battery replaced.(+$10 out of pocket) BAD: First time in the shower, filled with water GOOD: Amazon sent another watch the next day BAD: was the same exact watch, I had returned first time still not working GOOD: Amazon agreed to refund money when they recieve the watches BAD: April 10th still waiting for refund   I had a very similar watch from pulsar that I bought in 1991 - that watch lasted over 15 years with no problems. the LCD stopped working so I finally broke down and bought a new watch. I was shocked and disappointed with amazon sending me 3 dead watches - esp after talking to them asbout making sure it just works before sending it. the final watch was the exact same watch I returned for NOT working. 
 This product is a great idea, unfortunately the design is just really poor. Installation went pretty smooth, the problem is that the thing is really unstable. It flexes, bends and wobbles - basically it's just not supported very well. To add insult, the cover that came with it doesn't fit. I'd strongly recommend you look for one of those mini table top irons if you want something to do touch ups 
 This book is loaded with lots of unintersting information. The other positive reviews for this pamphlet/book must have been submitted by friends & family.  I love Disneyland and there are plenty of good travel guides to get you around the park with important and interesting insider information but this isn't it. Painfully boring from start to finish. For example: #77 Did you know that the giant mushroom at the loading zone of Alice in Wonderland is a former ticket booth? What a waste of money and time 
 I too bought this on VHS for Vincent D'Onofrio.  My only negative comment about his performance is that there's not enough of it!  I'll say right here and now that I'm not a big fan of Smits or Scacchi, and D'Onofrio overpowers them every time he's on screen.  It's a beautiful story, and I can see why director Gillian Armstrong was attracted to it - it is a love story with a bit of real-life depth (rather than those soapy ones where the ridiculous problems are created by the characters for lack of imagination - Julia Roberts films, anyone?).  That being said, the two lead roles needed to be played by stronger actors, and ones that could keep up with D'Onofrio vivacity.  Worth a look for fans 
 Normally I don't write books reviews but this book was so horrendous that I felt I needed to warn other Danielle Steel fans.  I have read all of Danielle Steels books and but this is one of the most poorly written books ever by anyone. The idea is good but the entire book needs to be rewritten by someone else. It seems the editor and publishing house didn't care what was inside the cover as long as it had Danielle Steel wrote on the front. I wonder if the editor even looked at this book?!?!?!  
 I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so.  He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it.  He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics.  I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world.  All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later.  Still lots of people think he is grea 
 Loved the show.  Hate the book.  I bought this to read on the plane during a recent trip because it had short passages that could be read seperately and still be enjoyed.  However, I didn't find most of them funny, even when I imagined him on stage telling them.  I don't recommend this book but suggest the DVD's of the show instead 
 It would be so easy to suggest a main title for the review in an obvious word play of the film, such as "this film should've stayed quiet" or "film doesn't follow own advice and shut up" but that's too easy. Because basically watching the film you start to notice you almost like it for the wrong reasons. Director Jamie Babbit, previously known for directing lesbian drama But I'm a Cheerleader, shows a family with much sordid details and secrets but just not the right approach.  The Deer family (don't laugh, that's their last name) adopt Dot, a deaf-mute who becomes a quick target for the daughter, Nina. However, Dot's seemingly useful ability to hear but not hear what people say brings about some family secrets and tension and ultimately the bigger question is what secret does Dot have that she's not sharing?  Sometimes there are lines that are obviously meant to bring about a laughter, where because it's ridiculous and toilet humor, scatching and political or just a knowing laugh like a "I know how that is". But it's a bad sign when a line, meant to be serious, brings laughter. There are several lines like this in the film including one involving a guy talking about his "manhood". The story isn't that well-written either.  The family secret is pretty rough but there's no emotional connection so the only thing bad about the secret is what it actually is and not how it affects anyone in the film.  How's the actors? Well after awhile you mistake hotness for acting. While Camille Belle was surprising in a film called the Ballad of Jack and Rose, here she's pretty good but there's not a lot of depth to the character whereas Elisha Cuthbert, equally hot, has tons of depth but maybe not acting chops at times. While she is given enough time to develop a character, it's unfortunately not enough time before we're whisked somewhere else. Then there's the whole "Dot's secret" which would've worked if she didn't narrate and there was enough scenes to have you already guessing what it was.  If there's nothing else to rent and can't find anything, give it a shot but perhaps it's best to just admire Belle and Cuthbert with the sound off. Ugh, another "quiet" joke 
 Extremely biased toward a non-property owner viewpoint.  Although the government is spending money to keep sand and retain structures, it is also acting in the interest of public safety.  Also, many government agencies are limiting what property owners can do with their own money, on their own property, to save their investments.  Both sides of the argument are not presented evenly 
 I stopped reading this book when it said that low self-esteem is a possible cause of thyroid antibodies. I'm a research psychologist and am very familiar with psychosomatic research, so I feel qualified to say that this is complete hooey. There are too many sections in this book that smack of unscientific thinking and unsubstantiated comment. I bought this book hoping for practical advice, and there is some of that. But there is also a fatal overdose of hippie stuff. A better book is Mary Solomon's What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Hypothyroidism 
 I do love the other Karen Katz books, and was GREATLY disappointed with this book. We read it to our two-year-old son, who was having trouble learning to share. He liked it, so we read it to him a few times, although I instinctively felt it was not teaching the concept of sharing the way I believed it should be taught. But, I thought that her other books were good and certainly it wouldn't hurt him to read it. Boy, was I wrong! His next play date, I asked him to share, and instead of sharing the toy he was playing with, he grabbed a toy from another child and shoved a different toy (one he didn't like) into her hands instead. He proudly announced, "I'm sharing!" as he did so, and of course, the other child began to cry. This was the concept of sharing he gathered from his understanding of the Karen Katz book.  This book shows angry, fighting children playing tug of war with desired toys with a simple, angry message -- "My toy! You can't have it!" When you open each flap, it says, "But maybe you can play with this toy instead." That's pretty much the design of the whole book, which features angry, spoiled children refusing the share, but making "substitutions" instead. Nowhere is there any mention of taking turns or playing with the same toy together, which is the view of sharing that my husband and I have chosen to teach our son.  Once I got rid of this book, I found a much more appropriate book that has been extremely helpful for our son. It is called "Sharing Is Fun," by Joanna Cole. It's a great book! It features a little boy whose mom is helping him get ready for a play date by allowing him to select a couple of toys to put away, toys that are "too special to share," such as his special bedtime bear. Then the mommy tells him all the other toys can be played with by any of the children. The other children come over, and there is a situation in which the mother has to show the boy how to take turns, and another where all three children play together. If you are looking for a good book to teach an older toddler or preschooler the concept of sharing, I suggest you skip this terrible Karen Katz book altogether and go for "Sharing Is Fun," by Joanna Cole.    
 I really didn't enjoy the movie, but  I had to finish it.  The hypocrisy of Faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so-called fundamentalist that I know, but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying.   This movie presented a very perverted view of Christianity.  Though there was alot of talking about Jesus and saying His name, it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually KNEW HIM and spent time with Him.  When Mary gets a revelation from something she believes is Christ that opposed the actual Word of God, she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision.  Christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against His Word.  No one actually reads a Bible in the movie.  Consequently, most made many life-damaging decisions.   I hated the "reality" of the movie, but it has challenged me to actually spend time with Christ and learn about Him. I shudder to think that I could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what Christianity truly is.  
 Saw an extract from this book in Mary Engelbreit's magazine - it looked good so I ordered the book from Amazon.  Thought the information was good, recipes look good - both for the cakes and for the icings.  HATE the easel format.  It isn't a book, its a little flip-chart on a shakey easel with weird flaps and folds.  Might be useful if you want to sit the book up on a counter and look at it while cooking but it really detracts from when you just want to sit and read it.  It has a lot of text not associated with a specific recipe so you'd really want to just read it - the pages are head to head so you can't even read one page and then the next.   Despite the appeal of the recipes, I probably would have passed had I realized how the "book" was set up.   
 I tend to be suspicious of official stories.  But that does not mean that I am ready to jump at pretty much any alternative to such stories, no matter how absurd it may be.  Many major events have unusual aspects.  But that does not mean that they did not happen!  What's next from these folks?  Maybe an explanation that Japan never attacked Pearl Harbor in December of 1941?  Or that the United States never dropped atomic bombs on Japan in August of 1945?    The Twin Towers really did collapse.  And there's evidence that airplanes flew into them!  We Americans thought that we had some good people guarding us against sneak attacks.  And I think we did.  But these people either were not quite as good as we thought, or were asleep at the switch, or were confounded by a bunch of regulations that made it tough for them to gather information in a timely manner.  There have been other planned attacks on America.  And, luckily, some of the more serious ones failed.  In at least a few cases, our security people uncovered these plots in time to thwart them.  But we had no such luck on 9/11/2001.  Unless you want to consider it lucky that even more people were not killed.  There's plenty of evidence for how the attacks took place, and some of it is described in the 9/11 commission report.  There's very little evidence for any other hypothesis, in spite of what this book implies.  Books such as this one rarely get taken seriously by knowledgeable people, and that has a tendency to get some readers to think that much of what they read in these books is virtually unchallenged.  That's not the proper conclusion.  In particular, theories that we Americans brought down the Towers on purpose (one of the ideas considered by the authors) are not merely contrary to the evidence but illogical as well.  I do not recommend this book 
 Is this Deaver's worst book? I honestly don't know because I haven't read everything he's written. However, I can emphatically say this is the worst of his books I have read -- and I have read most.  (... 
 I've tried to finish this book five times -- and finally gave up and gave it away. Basically, this is one man's ego trip about how to become a successful real estate agent. His ideas are good, but I couldn't get past the self-fulfilling pat on the back 
 I think the originals in japanese of real emotion and 1000 words were much better. I don't really like Jade's voice. It seems too sharp. Also, the recording sounds kind of low quality. Even though I don't understand the japanese version, I prefer the japanese version over this english version. 
 French Baroque is not a very well known style in performance circles either by the performers themselves or audiences. In particular, viola performances are probably the least known or heard. The viola da gamba is the cello's predecessor and prominent in both English and French Early-Mid Baroque. The instrument has greater range and resonance with 7 strings. There are probably fewer than 300 professional players performing on this instrument today. There are probably 4-5 who are the best and the musicians here are not even close to the talent of the undisputed and unmatched French master violist, Jordi Savall: there is absolutely no comparison.   The pieces here are mostly too slow in their interpretations of the meter and the players are simply not proficient enough to play most of them in terms of technique and knowledge of the French Baroque style. The violas are groaning in slow agony or screeching most of the time which is completely at odds with the intentions of the composer. All of them are equally pathetic in their execution. Listen to a sample of Savall's performances such as on the soundtrack to 'All The Mornings of The World' and the music will simply explain itself for you to make your descisions in buying French Baroque. He also has the best performance of Lully's 'Les Concerts Royaux' that I have ever heard: this man is nothing less than a prodigy in his art of the viola and his direction of French Baroque. I have the utmost respect for this man as an artist: he is truly a living legend.   For French Baroque in general and especially for Marin Marais or other viola composers, there is no other performer/conductor than Jordi Savall worth listening to. Especially for viola, his closest contenders are still motionless on the ground while he is flying circles in the stratosphere: there is simply no comparison and his virtuosity is exponentially superior to every one else's. Find out for yourselves and you will soon be agreeing with what I say. Since they didn't mention him by name, it seems that the previous reviewers have not heard Savall and so I wouldn't give too much credence in their overgenerous ratings. Good luck in your search for great music!   
 "The Day the World Went Away" was the leadoff single from "The Fragile" and is of minimal value to all but collectors.  Two of the tracks on this are taken straight from "The Fragile" (with small adjustments, one's slightly shorter, one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in), with the third (a remix) also being available on part two of the "We're In This Together" singles.  But looking at the songs themselves-- "The Day The World Went Away" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end.  The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong.  I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece.  "Starf***ers, Inc" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing.  Material aside, unless you're a completionist, you can skip this one 
 The nail clippers,hairbrush, and comb are great but I did not care for the rest. It would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company 
 I'm not particularly a Gore supporter but in my opinion this is a "hatchet job," done with a dull, rusty hatchet.  Not worth the read; surely not worth the price.  I give it one star only because there is no provision for giving it none...or "negative" stars.  I'm sorry I bought this, didn't check it out of the library, wasted the money 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.    
 I usually like Deaver's stories, but I actually only made it through half of the book...then tossed the thing. I am not crazy about the subject matter when it involves children (even if they are at the teen stage). Should have paid more attention to the info at the back of the book. And I definitely don't need to have obscenities every sentence. My mother always stated that people who swore constantly had nothing of interest to say. I find this to be true, even in my choice of literature. My time on this earth is too short to waste reading this type of material.   So I am a prude...  Karen Sadle 
 Frankly, folks, Spinelli can do lots better than this! He's proven it with books like Crash, Loser, and (most of) Stargirl. So what in the world happened to him here??? Both of the main characters here are incredibly immature. I think junior high and high schoolers should be insulted by a story that portrays them as so shallow! The constant name-calling, whining, lying, and so forth really got on my nerves. True, toward the end one tragedy and another near-tragedy bring Greg and Megin closer together. But by then you may not like them enough to care. And a couple of Spinelli's much more likeable minor characters, such as Megin's "adopted grandmother" Emilie Bain, are hardly developed. What GOT INTO Spinelli here? This book is tremendously skippable. Read Crash instead. "Sibling rivalry" gets a fairer portrayal there, even though it's not the book's main theme 
 Your web-page is misleading.  It quotes, and the image displays, the Middle English original of the poem. The inside pages shown are from the Middle English edition.  However, (and the modernized title should be a giveaway, but it wasn't) the edition on this page is in modern English -- a translation, not Chaucer's poem.  You need to clean up this page, take away the Middle English quotations, state that it's a modern translation, and refer the prospective buyer to the actual, modernized edition -- which the buyer may or may not want (in my case I did not), with assistance in finding the actual Middle English masterpiece 
 I was looking forward to this book, but was very disappointed once I got it.  Several of the patterns were already in their previous books, and one of the others (the sheep shawl) is just four of the sheep scarf from a previous book that are then sewn together.  I have enjoyed most of the previous books from the "Vogue Knitting on the Go" series and expected more from this book, but it did not deliver 
 Gun nuts NEED to have their guns taken away.  What the NRA doesn't want you to know is that most firearm murders are committed by legal gun owners against members of their own families or other close friends and associates.  They also don't want you to know how many children die every year by accidents with firearms and suicide by firearm--if those guns weren't lying around the house for them to find, those accidents and those suicides would not happen.  I pray for the day that the US government will get the moral compass necessary to GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PRIVATE CITIZENS.  
 This was the first edition of this book that I bought, and it is almost completly unreadable. Granted this is a budget book; however, the quality is completly lacking. If you are going to buy this book, which you should, it is an excellent peice in understanding More's society, I recomend the Penguin edition 
 I think this may be a great product, and is why I bought it. However, mine NEVER worked (and hence was never actually used, it was just taken out of the box!)The remote would beep the collar but not spray. Seller did have manufacturer send new batteries (which further delayed my getting a good response to this situation). New batteries arrived, item still didn't spray, but seller would only refer me to dealing directly with the manufacturer, to get a replacement, even though I responded within their advertised 30 day return policy. Please read seller information and return policies CAREFULLY! Even if you get them to take something back (only if never opened...if opened and doesn't work, they toss you to the manufacturer), there is a 25% RESTOCKING FEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pretty exorbitant and not Amazon type service I have come to expect over many years of buying from Amazon! Be very careful of sellers that are not Amazon...sometimes it isn't very clear it is not Amazon. My feedback on Seller is on feedback page and seller responded, but I don't get a chance to respond to their feedback, which gives the misconception that I actually used this product! I couldn't have used it as it didn't work! If you want to buy this, I'd recommend a reputable pet store such as Pet Smart where you can easily take an item back if it doesn't work and get a refund. Even if they are willing to replace something, you may not want to risk having future problems with it in a month or two and would want a refund, which most stores have no problem with doing for you. Next time I go the established pet stores 
 I've just brought and finished reading this book on 2/21/2007. I disagree/agree with some of the products she recommended for us to use! For example, I disagree with using the Leave-in conditioners which makes your hair very smelly though they help you detangle your hair easily after washing, other than that they dont help your hair get better at all! Besides, using a good conditioner weekly and rinseing it out works far better than the leave in conditioners! However, using deep conditioners should always be used with heat, so there is no way you could be roaming around your house doing the house chores, like she mentioned! I also disagree with using products with petroleum which makes your scalp itch alot, like burnt, and again they dont help your hair in any ways to get better, they are fantastic at coating only! I do agree that using oils, protien treatments and good hair conditioners helps our hair get better and healthier!    Brothers and sisters, remember most of these products are not made by ppl who knows/understand our hair! They make us believe what we should be using and we follow! Or sometimes we want to believe what we are expecting!  Overall, I knew all about the good stuff she mentioned and have disagreed with the new so called information she had given! What a waste of my money purchasing it overseas : 
 This movie was pretty bad. I know that it was a B-horror flick, but come on. There were a couple of good actors but most were not that good even for a B flick. Yes, this movie was a rip off from other movies, but there was one movie that the rest of the critics missed and that was Jeepers Creepers. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars was because of a couple of the actors and there were a couple of scares in it that were pretty good. I don't recommend this movie even for the B-horror fans 
 As a Starbucks employee of almost 2 years at my college... I know how to brew espresso and properly make drinks.  My roommates got this for me as a Christmas present at the Field Days Sale so I could make coffee drinks for all of our late night study sessions.  After about 2 months of use... the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead.  I contacted a service advisor at Krups' website and it turns out that I would have to ship the machine to the nearest service center in Illinois on my own dime.  No thank you!  I'll find something better 
 Because this is a collection of essays, a certain amount of repitition in the writing was to be expected.  But it still made reading this collection a bit tiresome.  In many cases, the same critisisms have been done better, or at least more up to date.  And there was a whole section I skipped over entirely just because all the essays were the same.  This book has some important stuff to say about what is going on in the right-wing media, but it could have been presented in a much better, more interesting way 
 Richard Falk writes with a pedantic manner, but his assertions about recent history are radical and vituperative in the extreme. He attacks the United States on virtually every page, impugning our motives, morals, and methods. He talks about his own country in terms that might be used by our most implacable enemies. He writes of an America that whose main goal is "geopolitical intimidation."  He expresses alarm that America is no longer "balanced nor deterred" by an adversary like the Soviet Union. Mr. Falk reminisces fondly of the Soviets, because the threat that they might annihilate the U.S in a nuclear holocaust kept us from oppressing the rest of the world.  On the first page Mr. Falk asserts that Pearl Harbor was not a surprise attack, but part of the Roosevelt administration's "deliberate plan to lure the country into World War II." The anti-american tone is unrelenting. Many American foreign policy moves in the past century are examples of aggression, economic opportunism, and cultural imperialism. He reveals his own biases, not only with his arguments, but also with his lexicon. He refers to american leaders as "reactionary and pro-military forces." He decries the "martial atmosphere" after 9-11, with a "patriotic fervor never before seen in America." Maybe Mr. Falk has never seen it before.  Mr. Falk suggests that al-Qaeda might be "an imaginary network conjured up by intelligence agencies." He leaves the realm of the merely oppositional, and ventures into delusional thought. He gives serious consideration to many conspiracy theories that could be used by psychiatrists to identify a break with reality. If you believe that our own government blew up the World Trade Center, Mr. Falk is your muse. He suffers from that peculiar form of self-hatred that leads to self-abasement, and the condemnation of one's own country.   There is much to criticize about our country, and the war on terror. Mr. Falk is so critical of the United States that he seeks to destroy our ability to define and defend ourselves. Self criticism is a vital element of public virtue, but self-abnegation is rarely useful, and often harmful. His is a left-wing jeremiad, but Mr. Falk is no Jeremiah. 
 Hobsbawm's metaphysical system, communism, ultimately denies national sentiment.  So we can expect, and we do indeed receive, considerable attempts throughout the book to diminish, degrade and put down nationalism -- everything from the anti-intellectual argument that nationalism only began when the word "nation" appeared, to an exegesis of its evils in the 20th century.  This bias is made worse by high-handed, hypocritical lecturing at the end of the first chapter about how the social scientist is supposed to be "objective."  Phffft!  Eric is one of the last people in the world to lecture us on objectivity 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 As many others have pointed out, this book is quite biased in it's handling of the cuisines of different countries.  Yes this book is quite Anglo-centric, but what would you expect?  There is also a clear dislike of all things American and the author would have you think that this countries sole contributions to the world of gastronomy are fast food joints and Coca Cola.    However, the reason I only gave it one star is the accuracy of the entries.  We have a right to expect that reference works from this publisher be painstakingly researched to present information without error.  But there are just too many factual errors to ignore.  Three examples serve to make my point.  In an entry about ice cream sundaes, he refers to one of the towns as Two Rivers, Michigan.  Two Rivers is in Wisconsin.  Next, in an entry for chuck wagon he refers to wranglers as the assistants to the cook.  Wranglers handled the movement of the herd and never, ever assisted the cook who almost always worked alone.  Third, in an article about the United States, he writes of the emergence of fast food chains including "White Tower" Huh?  I'll admit that sliders aren't for all palates, but the chain is White Castle.  There are just three that come to mind but I'm only up to the letter F.  Should obvious, easy to research mistakes such as these be tolerated?  For me, it brings the accuracy of the entire book into question.  I expected better from Oxford University Press 
 I was surprised when I purchased this album.  Not as interesting as I thought it would be.  I found it boring.  The only song I liked was  "the Pageant of the bizarre"; it's truly Zero 7.   
 depressing as each chapter starts with a final illness segment.  Without that it would have been a MUCH better and more enjoyable book.  It may have been cathartic and healing for Chris, but not so for me 
 After being involved with Weigh Down and leading a group myself, I lost some weight, but suffered worse medical conditions from it. If your body is not used to trans fats from being on low fat diets like mine was, you may shock your system. I ended up in the hospital for five days and had my gallbladder removed. Sugar addiction is not easily overcome and if you listen to your body's cravings, it will tell you to indulge in sugar. Obviously this can lead to diabetes. Regardless of what your faith is, Gwen is giving dangerously wrong information about the body's physiology. We know too much now to ignore facts about our health and to eat like she suggests. She takes no responsibility for anyone being hurt from it either. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!! 
 I love Pratchett and it's intriguing to think of a science book written by him but I'm not made of money 
 I suppose I was looking for a "how to deal with it" from an someone educated in the field.  This was more like a "here's what happened in this school" book.  I was left saying to myself, "That's what happened in that school then.  What about what is happening in schools in other regions of the country (which makes a huge difference), and how does a parent successfully respond to the changes and conflicts that my kid is going through?"  Some of the story lines were interesting, but did not help me at all.  I regret buying the book 
 I can't review an item you haven't sent me yet 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 According to the book, the Kellams lived a frugal life on their island, subsisting mostly on "peanuts and sardines." And they "wanted no machinery that would require fuel beyond the kerosene and gas lamps." Well, you don't have to go to a pristine wilderness to live like that. They could just as well have been living in a tenement in New York city, buying their canned sardines and bags of peanuts at the local market and using a bare bulb for light. It is easy to survive in the wilderness if you stockpile enough sardines and kerosene. What would have been a challenge is IF they had attempted to survive on what they could forage, fish, hunt, or grow with the tools they could make (like the Native Americans did). Simplicity is an easy thing if the canning factory is operating, the peanut farmers and merchants are toiling their trades, and one has enough of a pension to purchase those necessities.   
 I think it's disgusting the lack of research Yale Daily News put into this 2007 guide.  There are a hundred things wrong with this guide, but just from opening to the school I go to (University of Delaware), and seeing that one of the things I have to do before I graduate is "go to the Stone Balloon," I could tell this book was just a new cover to the 2006 with updated admissions statistics.  The Stone Balloon, a historic University of Delaware Bar and Music Hall, announced more than a year ago that it was going to be knocked down and replaced by condiminiums on Main Street.  This was true, and it was closed for the spring, and camera crews were there at the beginning of the summer to see huge bulldozers knock it over.  Pretty sad that NO ONE will be able to fulfill the Insider's Guide's instructions.  Sweet life Yale...do some research and stop making money reprinting the same "best-selling" book each yea 
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
 Rarely have I had the misfortune of coming across such an unmitagated biased piece of "scholarly" writing.  The book is no doubt scholarly in Traill's coverage of Schliemann's letters and diaries, unfortunately the author seeks only those passages which he can twist to suit his own often stupifying arguments.  My advice is to only read this book if you want the view of an anti-Schliemann extremist, but to instead read Heinrich Schliemann's own publications and an assessment of his contribution from a trained archaeologist instead of a historian who cannot suitably comprehend (or in this instance decides to ignore) his contribution to the development of excavation and post-excavation analysis such as the pathological study of skeletal remains.  Schliemann was far from perfect but neither were his contemporaries, nor did he ever claim to be a "scholar" although he aspired to reach scholarly status.  It appears that certain sections of the academic community continue to attack this upstart amateur in the same way as some historians of the time did.  But those in the archaeology community are aware of Schliemann's contribution and would rightfully produce a much more balanced assessment than given by Traill, which lets face it would not be difficult 
 I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it. 
 I thought this book was very informative and easy to understand, good for anyone who has no clue around a kitchen 
 This biography is particularly deceiving as Mr. Barnes packages it wrapped in historical information, but then includes misinformation and gossip  presenting it all as facts 
 I feel bad rating this book so low but I also don't want to rate it higher because I hate this book. The only reason why I read this book was because I had to read it for my english class at school. If it wasn't for the class there is absolutely no way I would have read this book. the teachers thought that we should read a civil war novel for english because were doing a civil war unit in social studies. Before we even started the novel I thought we were doing plenty of civil war, but no we have to do even more civil war. I probably wouldn't have such a hard time with this book if I didn't have to do school work with. I had such a hard time understanding some parts of this book because the family had so many people in it. I struggled to read this book every night not only because it was boring, but because I had to try to understand it so I could do the work that went with it. The only thing that happens in this book is in the begging the civil war is about to start and then some people from this family fight in the war and then they write letters to the family. Thats litteraly the only thing that happens in this book. In my opinion this book was boring and I would not recomend reading it, unless you really want to because you have nothing else to do 
 I got this book hoping it would reveal "the weight loss program to transform your life etc."  I found the book to be pretty light on the program part.  There are a lot of tips from the contestants and from the trainers, but no real solid weight loss program and no logic or reasoning behind the tips that are given.  Overall, I would only recommend this book is you are a fan of the show looking for contestant anecdotes.  If you are serious about weight loss this book is not for you 
 There was very little useful information in the book about the details of obtaining patents or trademarks - a lot of legal definitions and the like but few nuts and bolts for anyone looking to apply for them 
 It's said that the second historian was the first revisionist.  In other words, to some extent any and every telling of history reveals as much about the historian as it does the history.  But for as much as the telling of history is always interpretive, it is also entirely possible for an historian to confront, recognize, and largely neutralize her own interpretive biases; while she need not abandon or apologize for her point of view, nevertheless it is her responsibility to present all the relevant historical facts -- especially those that might cast doubt upon her interpretations and agendas -- and then argue her case with all of the relevant information on the table.  That is the difference between interpretive history and deceptive or misleading polemic.  Lepore accomplishes only polemic here, then, in that she presents as supporting evidence for her biases only her own highly questionable interpretations of the semantics of the colonists' own writings on King Philip's War.  She is hermeneutically daft, asserting a self-contained truth within those writings that is simply absurd.  Texts (especially in the case of the very personal diary entries, private letters, and firsthand accounts that constitute the overwhelming majority of the colonists' writings on King Phillip's War) do not and cannot contain some absolute, inescapable meaning that imposes itself upon the reader.  Texts communicate their real meaning only when referred to the indigenous contexts (social, political, religious, philosophical, linguistic, psychological, etc.) that produced them; when removed from those contexts and read in ignorance of them, the reader must of necessity substitute the contexts and agendas of her own experience for the authentic contexts, so that the texts will appear to have radically different meanings than they really do -- they will seem to mean whatever the interpreter wants them to mean.    And what does Lepore want the Puritans' writings to mean?  What is her agenda here?  Essentially, it is portray the Puritan colonists of 17th century Massachusetts as despicable hypocrites.  Now, as I said, if that's her agenda and her bias, that's fine; but it is acceptable for her to present the conclusions born of that agenda and bias as history only on the condition that they are argued in light of all the evidence that might call them into question.  Lepore fails on this count.  Again, she confines the supporting evidence she provides for her theses to her own highly speculative interpretations of the colonists' writings; as other reviewers have noted here, then, this book is much closer to deconstructionist literary criticism than it is to history.  She misses the forest for the trees: she makes no attempt to check her interpretive biases against the broader historical narrative that is the context of King Phillip's War.  For example, in 1622 the natives around the Jamestown settlements in Virginia attempted to eradicate the presence of the colonists, through a surprise act of genocide that followed eight years of peaceful coexistence.  The attack ultimately resulted in the deaths of two-thirds of the roughly 1200 colonists in Virginia at the time, and sent a powerful shock through the other New World colonies and their groups of sponsors across the Atlantic.  The natives committed their genocide at Jamestown only two years after the Plymouth colony was founded; it is unquestionable, then, that from the earliest years onward the Massachusetts colonists' attitudes toward their native neighbors would have been colored (and rightly so) by a great deal of suspicion and mistrust in light of the knowledge of what the Virginia natives had done to the Jamestown settlers -- only fifty years before King Phillip attempted essentially the same thing.  Yet Lepore never once mentions the genocide in Virginia, and does not recognize its immense significance for the relations of the English and the natives in Massachusetts fifty years later.  To name another example, Lepore offers no analysis whatsoever of the nature of the Puritan faith of the Massachusetts colonists, and how that faith affected their conduct in the war.  She does mention their faith in a non-specific way, when it serves to imply a monstrous hypocrisy on the part of the colonists; but never is an astute or sympathetic understanding of their religion presented, and since the early Massachusetts colonies were communities of an almost monastic fervor, devotion, and asceticism, Lepore simply ignores an immensely important factor in their motives and reasoning during King Phillip's War.  In its place, she asserts that the colonists fought to preserve their "Englishness;" in support of this idea, she presents some diary entries and editorials of the day in which the colonists wrote of their fear of becoming like the savages, should their common life in the New World continue in the direction they thought it was headed.  But it seems perfectly clear to me that Lepore has grossly misinterpreted those writings.  The colonists did not actually think that their assimilation into the native culture and way of life was real possibility: the warning that they might "become like the savages" was not a cultural apprehension of theirs, but rather the sort of hyperbole so often used in Christian homilies and catechisms and pastoral essays intended to exhort the faithful.  The Massachusetts Puritans were not afraid of becoming Indians.  They were afraid of losing their faith, losing the Christian path through life that they had sacrificed so much to preserve.  They were afraid of any compromise or waning of the Christian zeal and austerity of their near-monastic lives.  After all, it was in order to preserve the Christian life that they had left England in the first place, decades earlier: they had first settled in Holland after the English anathematized them, and then left for the New World when they saw their faith diluted by worldly comforts and distractions while living on the Continent.  So to me, the idea that they fought the natives in King Phillip's War to defend their "Englishness" is simply preposterous.  Englishness was something they had willingly left behind to purse their religion, and played no more of a role in most of their lives and motives than that of superficial, sentimental cultural orientation.  I think it's deceptive for Lepore even to pose the question, "why were the English really fighting?" as though it requires some subtle expert analysis: the colonists fought the natives because the natives were trying to kill them... it's as simple as that.   There are many more examples of Lepore's highly selective consideration of the historical record, and highly questionable reasoning and interpretation.  But it is not possible to argue them satisfactorily in a review such as this, of course: to respond adequately I would have to write a book of my own (as I've already made a good beginning of doing), taking Lepore point by point.  One thing I'll grant her is that she presents her source material openly, with no attempt to conceal certain passages that might be interpreted any number of other ways than those she has chosen.  But again, the biases and misunderstanding that a 21st century American will inevitably bring to any reading of texts produced by 17th century Puritans render any approach to understand their conduct of King Phillip's War solely by a consideration of those documents a myopic, naïve, misguided effort, and doomed to failure 
 From about the second page of this book, I was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it. The characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another. Add to that the stereotypical characters (the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys, the women are all "large-assed" or fat with the exception of Ella).  And the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb, not to mention kind of repulsive (I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but Tuck's descriptions are completely banal).  Oh wait, there's more. The Spanish is ATROCIOUS. It's hard to believe that Tuck had a translator for this book. It's pretty clear that whoever copy edited it neither reads nor writes nor speaks Spanish. Half the names are grammatically incorrect. Many of the words are just plain wrong ("vita" means life in Italian, not Spanish, for starters). I felt embarrased for the author. Does she know that her book is full of errors? The one word that comes to mind when thinking about this book is: SHALLOW. I sincerely hope that readers don't mistake this book for historical fiction. The author clearly knows little about Paraguay and its people and history, and clearly doesn't care, from her superficial treatment of it. 
 Yes, another spell book.  Gee... thanks.  There are several Romani 'spell books' avaliable now.  There is a little bit here about the philosophy behind the magic; but actually (if I'm recalling correctly) this author seems more tainted by Western Esoterica than other authors I've heard tell about.  The spells are folk-loreish in their nature, which is all fine and good, I don't expect any different.  What I do expect, and hope for, is an explaination of how things work.  What is the driving force behind this energy.  Why is the sun coming up.  What am I doing.  How is it different from what I've been doing?  Give me something anything to hang onto here.  Don't just tell me to play nice in the dirt.  Yes I know I'm being a tad harsh here.  But it is fustrating to try to reach into any real 'earth magick' trad (by which I mean non-Wiccan) since there is little ritual to hang onto, and the explainations are few and far inbetween.  The author doesn't even seem to try 
 I watch alot of documentaries and this is by far the worst I have ever seen. I looked forward to watching it being somewhat familiar with Rayful's story but this dvd is just not made very well. This is an hour of reenactments. The story told in this dvd is so one sided. There is so much left I was left wondering why?  There is a quote at the end of the film that is almost comical basically saying the producers did not want to glorify drug dealing. If you do not want to glorify drug dealing try showing all the bad that came out of all the drugs in D.C. at the time.  I read that Kirk Fraser the maker of this film dropped out of film school at Howard University after watching this I think he should have stayed in school. This looks like it was made by a high school kid. 
 This book did not speak to me at all.    I'm a Polytheist.  The Temple Mount is the site of the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.  Well, that Temple is gone.  And I think it would indeed be a crime (although not all that big a crime) to knock down the Dome of the Rock and rebuild the Temple to some genuine, sophisticated, and modern Deities.    Well, this book explains how some people want to discover where the First and Second Jewish Temples, which actually predate the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, stood.   It discusses some religious fanatics who want to rebuild the Jewish Temple.  It talks about Christians and Muslims as well.  I could say that we wouldn't have this problem if we'd just left the Temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva alone.  And that this entire issue is Their revenge on us for abandoning Them in favor of the ridiculous monotheist god.  But I won't do that.    Now, I do, of course, think it would be a crime if the Jews simply knocked down the Dome of the Rock and rebuilt their Temple in its place.  But I think there is little risk of that happening soon.  And I think that the claim that such a move would risk a world war is more than a bit of an exaggeration.  Anything could trigger some events that could have serious consequences.  But Gorenberg appears to put way too much importance on the Temple Mount.  Meanwhile, a few religious Jews and some assorted Jewish nationalists are thinking about building a new Temple.  Now, Gorenberg does point out that the religious fanatics are rather crazy.  But he managed to convince me that he's at least as crazy as they are.  First, it ought to be easy to resolve the question of the Dome of the Rock: unless there is a very good reason to remove it, simply leave it there!   And I see no very good reason.  Here, Gorenberg is correct to hope that we can all put our fights behind us and not kill each other over such issues.  But there is one minor problem that still needs to be addressed.    That problem is simple: it will not bring peace to say, "Let's all put the past behind us and quit fighting.  Since we no longer care about the Temple Mount, I'll take it and do what I please with it.  Since nobody cares about it any more, we ought to let me win!"   That will not work.  That is what would happen if we tore down the Dome of the Rock to build a Pagan, Jewish, or Christian Temple.  But is there a chance that we'll have the same problem if we give everything to the Muslims?  I think there is.  And I think Gorenberg fails to admit this at all.    The problem is simple.  Hindus have temples.  The Bahai have a splendid temple, in Haifa.  All sorts of religions have their special sites.  And no matter how silly Gorenberg thinks it is, Judaism is a temple-based religion.  If even a few Jews want to rebuild their temple, I think they'll do it eventually.  If that means tearing down the Dome of the Rock, that will annoy the Muslims.  If it means not building a temple at all, the issue suddenly leaves the world of religion for that of human rights: Muslims have no right to demand that people of some other religion be precluded from having a temple.    I think an obvious possible solution (not the only one) is for the Jews to resolve the issue by building a temple somewhere else, say on Mount Scopus.  But I think Gorenberg is crazier than the fundamentalists if he says that the only reasonable solution is to agree to fundamentalist demands to keep the Jews, but no others, from having a temple at all 
 I was totally put off by this collection of short stories. I do read erotica and women's fiction but this falls into neither catgory. The sexual obsessiveness of the characters became slightly repulsive for me and I gave up after 4 stories. There is no beauty to this writing, no sensuality in the descriptions. All I can say is that it is crude and if you like that, go for it 
 I kept waiting for Stephanie to wake up and realize that it was all a dream, but she didn't.  What shocked me even more was when I went on to read the 10th book and some of the story from Visions fo Sugarplums carried over.  I was already getting a little tired of the far fetched SP stories, but this one went too far.  If I could give it 0 stars, I would.  
 This book grabbed my attention as I began reading it, but I just could not finish it. You get the point of how protagonist perceives the world from the first chapter, then it becomes really tiresome. Tiresome so much , that I did not even finish reading it, I could not care less what will happen to the guy.  
 There is a lot of the author's rantings about big business and mining in his state. His ranting went on for nearly 100 pages, then he goes on to talk about the fall of societies that were doomed from the start. I could have made the analysis that he made about the specific societies that he picked. Personally I was dissipointed that he did not get into  idealistic reasons why some societies fail. I would have liked to see more about why very technilogically advanced societies failed throughout history 
 Strengths:  - Fairly complete coverage of the various properties of special functions.  The introduction of these subjects is not good, but one could use it as a refrence for formulas.  Weaknesses:  - Topic selection and rigor are weak.  Many important areas of mathematical physics are skipped over, or short changed.  For example, the section on tensors is far too short.  In addition, everything is introduced in index notation instead of coordinate free form.  Also, the group theory section is very weak (not to mention short).  The rotation group and lorentz group are discussed briefly, but there is no systematic introduction to lie groups or other important topics.    - The book seems to focus on special functions, and solving differential equations.  However, it does not introduce hilbert spaces well, and therefore the presentation seems like a bewildering array of bessel this and fourier that, without anything to tie it all together.  Overall, I'd say the book sacrifices depth by covering too many topics.  If you want to really succeed you're going to need a full course each on linear (& some multilnear) algebra, mutlivariable calc & vector analysis, differential equations, complex analysis, differential geometry and group theory.  If you want a condensed version, get byron and fuller.  It's written systematically, and strikes (in my opinion) a perfect balance between rigor and pragmatism 
 Although this critique might be viewed by my professors as academic suicide, I shall plunge headfirst and hope that the branches of tolerance break my fall.  I do not like A Room of Ones Own.  I understand the concept of stylized writing, but the content of the book does nothing to draw in the reader.  Certainly, Woolf's mastery in writing should be applauded on its merit; however, I am not progressed far enough in my education to fully appreciate Woolf's subtleties.  There is nothing in A Room of One's Own that remains once the book is closed, although the pages are full of wonderful ideas.  The presentation of these ideas; however, are uninteresting and handled in a very preachy manner.  It is my opinion that such revolutionary ideas should have been shot forth from a canon rather than whispered in a librar 
 After reading this book's predecessor, "Travelers' Tales:  Food," I had been eagerly waiting for the next volume of stories.  This book falls far short of the standard set in "Food."  None of  the stories are particularly memorable, enlightening or even entertaining.   Many have little to do with travel experiences.  While I really love the  Travelers' Tales books in general, this one was truly dissapointing 
 Product ad states 64 pods but they only shipped 16! When I called all they would refund was shipping, then I complained and they said $8 refund. So I asked for a return shipping lable and FULL refund. The CSR Amy was kind but her options from J&R were unacceptable 
 I disliked this book and highly recommend that students in an AP European History course refrain from purchasing it. The best AP European History study guides are brief and concise, and have only the information necessary to do well on the exam. This book, however, is too comprehensive. It left me wondering, "Do I really need to know all this stuff?" And you don't. Furthermore, the practice tests are different from the actual test in terms of types of questions and of content. Although their FRQ's are similar to the ones on the AP Exam, their sample essay answers are bad examples of good essays. Cracking the AP European History Exam from the Princeton Review is much better. Save your money and buy that instead. I gave this two stars instead of one because it makes an OK reference book, but a bad AP study guide 
 Mr. Perret somehow succeeded in writing an incredibly boring book about a man who lived an extrodinary life.  The book is also marred by continuous misstatements of fact and poor research.  To those looking for a good book on JFK, I advise you to take a look at Nigel Hamilton's "JFK: Reckless Youth" for illumination on his early life, Richard Reeves' "Profile in Power" for a broad look at his presidency, and Arthur Schlessinger Jr.'s "A Thousand Days" for an intimate look at his presidency that also gives you an excellent sense of who he was as a person.  "Jack" isn't worth the time 
 Robin Williams is Jack, whose physical development happens four times faster than normal. (There are real ageing diseases but I gather none of them remotely resemble this fairy tale.) So here he is aged ten with the mind of a ten year old and the body of, er, Robin Williams. His parents are educating him at home under the tutelage of kind old Bill Cosby. But this leaves him terribly lonesome for the company of other children. So Jack is unhappy. Sad Jack. Seeing this, his parents relent and send him to school where, just as they fear, the kids tell him he is a freak and pick on him. So he is still unhappy. More sad Jack. But then he is picked for a basketball side and next thing we know everyone loves him and he has lots of little friends. Hurray! Happy, smiling Jack. But then, oh dear, he starts comparing himself with the other kids. They will live to be 70 or 80 and he will be lucky to make it to 20. And the whole issue of girls is starting to confuse him. So he has a bit of a breakdown and his parents take him out of school. Oh dear. Real sad Jack. But then they send him back again. Happy Jack. Cut to Graduation Day and Jack, now very old in dog years, has been declared the school's first valetudinarian valedictorian. He's gonna die soon and all his friends are unhappy. Sad Jack's friends. But Jack is not unhappy. Jack is proud. Jack makes a speech about shooting stars being the brightest in the sky. Everybody cries. Mom cries. Dad cries. Bill Cosby cries. Wise Jack. Happy Jack. Awful, awful awful sentimental car wreck of a movie 
 We are a group of fourth graders from Mrs. Larson's class at Sunset Hill School in Lawrence, Kansas. Most of us thought parts of this book were boring. We thought the ending did not close out the story well. We felt there was something else going on in the story that the author didn't tell  us. The illustrations did not stand out and were difficult to understand.  If you looked at the illustrations they would not make you want to read the  book because they looked so sad. We also didn't like the story because the  characters had too much anger. We also thought the story should have a  happy ending. As it was it felt like the author had just stopped in the  middle of the story. Some people might enjoy this book but we didn't 
 Ill start on a more positive note: this book has a few neat things in it.  Like all the "complete" books, it has a smattering of prestige and base classes, and a few among these shine.  A verbatum set of words can be applied to the feat section as well, but the rest of the book, is pure bilge between two stiff pieces of cardboard.  The lack of inspiration is just the surface: Most of the material is transposed from older supplements, and most of that has been updated nicely, but the new stuff within it just simply falls flat in the balance, and concept department, the two most shameless of these being the tactical feats, and the hulking hurlur prestige class.  Tactical feats are like normal feats, only you get the equivalent of 3 feats! The shameless lack of thought in planning such a thing makes ones head spin. The weapon style feats also feature such innovative techniques as "Axe and Dagger", a popular mongolian fighting style for the truly moronic.   The worst of it is the Hulking hurler: a 3 level prestige class thats let you throw stuff really hard. 50+d6 hard if you sink a lot of gold into strength boosts.  A couple of my friends hero arena'd this at level 10, and the Hurlur took out two red dragons turn one.   Just when you thought the book couldnt get any worse, you flip to a section which explains how to effectivly make a character based of previous campaigns your DM has run. If you buy this book, smear whiteout or something similar over the title of this section, and ink in the real title: "MetaGaming, and How to Do It"  In closing, dont get this book.  The material within can be found quite readilly in other books, and the new stuff will only be allowed by the most incompetant of DM 
 		Although the premise of this book is brilliant, perceptive and absolutely vital to the next few years;  Reich sadly presents an incisive example of the economic thinking and progress that made Democrats relevant in the 1930s.  	It's years ahead of the Bush ideologues, who act and think as if the 20th Century never happened.  Reich is progressive enough to adopt the policies of the 1930s, and he does exceptionally well.  He knows how to blow an eloquent "toot" on the whistle of a charming old steam locomotive;  like many other politicians of nostalgia, he thinks it gives him the right to fly the Space Shuttle.  	The world is changing.  As an example, Wal-Mart can forecast with 5 percent accuracy how many copies of a new video disc it will sell, and it has that figure within four hours of the disc going on sale.  That's where the brains of Wal-Mart is located, and it's why the company needs only $10-an-hour clerks for the check-out counter and to stuff the shelves.  	When check-out counters were complicated, it made sense to hire $20-an-hour clerks.  Now the job involves holding a bar code in front of a laser scanner, it has become another job where many companies could use "los barratos illegales".  	No one has a "right" to a specific job;  work must be earned by those who acquire the necessary skills.  Fifty years ago, it made sense that American auto workers were the best paid in the world, their assembly work required skill.  Today, truly skilled jobs are done by robots;  assembly workers do low skill work that is too menial to be automated.  	Success today depends on the desire to learn technical and personal skills needed for a specific job. Sadly, too many people have VW "Bug" skills and Escalade attitudes.  Sorry, life isn't like that any more.  	Let's do some numbers:  there are about 190 million Americans in the labour force, plus 10 million unemployed;  at least 10 million illegal aliens have jobs here.  If Reich is right, then how can millions of illegal migrants with about a Grade 3 formal education get jobs that Americans with high school diplomas can't hold?  Instead, every illegal migrant with a job is another proof that Reich is outdated.  	Reich completely ignores this issue;  instead, he offers Depression-era solutions for the future knowledge economy.  There's a good business reason why there are millions of illegal migrants in America, and why no administration will take action against them.  Reich, as a former Secretary of Labour, should address that issue.  	The future is ahead.  Americans deserve a better than going back to the 1930s with Reich's liberal allies,  or back to the 1890s with Bush's conservatives of greed, cronyism, graft and war.  This book shows Reich would have been a great Labour secretary for Franklin Roosevelt, but he was merely a seat warmer in the 1990s.  	Please, we're all going to live in the future.  So, let's think about the future, instead of resurrecting colorful but antiquated policies of the past.  Reich should do much better, or else we'll all be Bushwhacked by the sultans of greedy-nomics.  
 The author clearly knows their topic. It is a pity they are unable to develop a clear and compelling narrative to the life of Henry II.  Details, then details within details, thicken this soupy "read" until all sense of pleasure and color in reading about the life of Henry II evaporate. This is not a book for the general reader, even one with much background in the Middle Ages.  Instead, "Henry II" is for scholars in search of finely woven exposition about the history of Henry II who do not require a flowing, interesting narrative

 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 It is odd, and perhaps a bit sad, that John Irving has become or became American's literary sweetheart.  Given his narrative concerns, it would seem a wide readership would have never been his fate.  For one, he is fixated on the mutilation of the human body.  This mania with mutilation borders on the near fantastic in The World According to Garp. And more disturbingly still, is it completely infiltrates the narrative's sense of sexuality.  For the narrator of Garp, sex and bodily mutilation are nearly synonymous.  And what is the purpose of this overall fixation with the lopping off of limbs and the act of sex?  In The World According to Garp, sex is not viewed as a healthy or even human impulse.  It is only when the major characters divest themselves of lust, or sexual activity, that they extricate themselves from most of their mental woes.  It's a grim vision.  It is hard to envision flocks of readers gobbling this book in the late 70's and early 80's and viewing it as the great voice of our (or their) time.  The novel is also written on a high level of generality.  No reader should expect to plumb very deeply into the human condition in this novel.  Like Garp's writing itself, Irving's prose is witty and salacious, but never really gives the reader any serious human dilemma to masticate and digest.  There is something to chew, but it is light fare.  
 Just finished this read and I am still wondering why.  It started out well enough; the story idea was original and interesting, but I should have figured it out when the "Indiana Jones stuff" started. The writing FOR THESE EXCITING PARTS WERE BIT OVERDONE!!!!  And then we are back to normal again, NO WAIT!  SOMETHING EVEN MORE EXCITING AND LESS PROBABLE IS HAPPENING NOW!!!!  Anyhow, I felt my 8th grader could have probably written this book.  So I had nothing more to read and I continued.  I should have stopped, because as you know if you have read the other reviews... the Davinci Code junk started.  What a load!  Jesus is now gay?  Couldn't come up with a variation of those gnostic views huh?  So lets make some stuff up and cause a controversy so we can sell books.  I really hate to tell you Mr. Reilly but thats not a new idea either. Very low quality read, in other words don't waste the time reading this when you can watch paint dry, water boil, or even watch a cake bake.  And if you are a late night reader as I am you would be better off going to sleep 
 I have heard many speak highly of the book, but I just don't get it. There is passion in his style and his delivery encouraging teachers to maintain integrity, to stay true to themselves, and so forth. I guess that I lose interest due to the verbose language used. There are many aspects to teaching, and it is a lot of work; I am not equating this aspect to success or failure for connection with the students. As I said, many that I have spoken to enjoy it... I don't 
 I went to a large, southern, greek school, like State U, 16 years ago, and I pledged a sorority as a sophomore. I personally never saw much of the "scandalous" stuff go on with my house or with my friend's houses, and we were all in "top" houses. Of course there was lots of drinking, days when we didn't go to class in favor of doing something else, make-out sessions with boys and "cliques" but that's college whether you're in a sorority or not.   I also saw first-hand that girls of all types got bids from houses of all types. I ended up depledging because the experience just wasn't for me (I probably would have stuck with it if I had pledged as a freshman), but I hardly think that sororities are all bad. Robbins didn't seem to do much more than try to prove a bunch of stereotypes as truth with no real proof, just assumptions she pieced together when she couldn't gain access the way she wanted to 
 This book seems to lack a voice. Considering that it is mostly quotes from other(and better) books about the german fighting man, it just didn't seem to flow well. The writing style reminded me of the terrible english papers I wrote for basic college writing. Besides that, it seemed like 50% of the quotes came from the Forgotten Soldier, making this book feel like a cliff notes version of Sajer's. In the time that it would take you to slog though this book, you could read two or three first hand accounts and form your own opinions 
 OS 10.4 seeks to be all things to all men, thus it contains many MB of no possible use to most users. It needs to include a purging program to remove trash. Fonts in foreign languages, translations (how many people in the US want to convert classical Chinese to simplified Chinesw), printer drivers for printers that the user doesn't have consume a great deal of space. This book needs to be far more aggressive.  
 The book reads like a gripping novel. Unfortunately, the evidence the author uses is pretty much innuendo, hearsay, and rumor. Having been a student there, his comments are exaggerated. Yes, there are some problems about the curriculum and professors who deem themselves self-important, but I doubt this problem is only at Harvard. This book capitalizes on the desire in America to see the  top stumble once in a while 
 I wish I had read further in the reviews, if I had known that the song 'I Love The Nite Life' had been replaced I would never have bought the film. It is very limp without this...shame, shame, shame! This should be mentioned so that folks can make a more informed decision, instead of wasting money 
 The cushion was designed for what I needed due to an injury, but the curve of the cushion, the pressure points, and the density of the cushion are wrong.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I have found a similar cushion that works very well 
 I was ready to like this book. I wanted to like this book. I'm interested in this particular era and the author has a fine reputation for the historical novel. So I began reading with great anticipation - only to discover deep disappointment. I haven't read his other works but he really strikes out with this one.  The idea is an interesting one - intertwine the story of Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy with a famous murder case in which the wireless figures prominently.  The problem is the author seems to have lost all his understanding of dramtic writing - character development (there is none), tension (there is none, we know the outcome before the book starts), Plot (plodding), Pacing (the author gives away the wireless tie-in during the first chapter, so there is no mystery at all - no dramatic announcements by the keen and stalwart detective at the last moment to surprise and delight the reader).  These historic, naturally dramatic events are presented as if we were reading a dreadfully boring history book. And there is no dialogue at all! We only hear from the characters when the author dryly quotes from their letters. Rather then letting the characters speak for themselves and tell their own story, the author lectures us on all that happens. Historically more accurate perhaps but it makes for dull and dreary reading.  The murderer, Dr. Hawley Crippen, is so shockingly inept that one wonders  how the man was able to tie his own shoes. He is so stupid that he can not devise of a simple cover story to explain his wife's disappearance (like she ran off with another man, for example) He allows his girl friend to wear his wife's easily identifiable jewelry and furs - right in his own office! Does he imagine no one will notice? He even sends his flunky out to buy several suits of boy's clothing - all but telegraphing his intent to flee with his girlfriend disguised as a boy.  When its not being a dry-as-dust history book, this tome is like reading a stuffy newspaper article in the Times of London. A nasty twit killed his wife and was caught (yawn).  I gave the book two stars rather then one because at least the parts about Marconi and his struggles to perfect and commercialize his invention are somewhat interesting.  I would recommend it only if you are waiting in the dentist's office and there was absolutely nothing else to read (and you found it sitting there).   In summary: a depressingly dull and boring book. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 The old Koskin design is great. I have 5 and just logged on to order one for a friend and am quite disappointed to see the changes, so... my friend will be getting something else. The way the old handle was attached was very cool, a selling point. Plus the mesh in the handle made orderly labeling easy and attractive. The "OLD' Koskin material was pretty cool too. If all this has changed - find something else - no reason to stick with Case Logic for average stuff. You can get no-name discount junk everywhere. Hope Case Logic reads this. 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 I am a fan of Jonathan Kellerman - have read all of his books and enjoyed most of them.  This was the last one I read.  It was too long - so many diversions that did not advance the story.  It seemed that JK was caught between writing a mystery/crime novel and writing a history of the conflict between the Palestinians and Israels.  This books was about 300 pages too long and very boring in many places.  This was JK fourth novel and I am glad that he got his sights back on target 
 This camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box.  One mistake I made was to not take my own SD card to the camera shop and look at the output.  I thought the blurry image I was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera.  I've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this. Casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work.  And point and shoot is definately not an option.  I thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping.  I've taken over 200 pictures and I will not print any of them. 
 Well, I heard the first track on the radio, so, what the heck! Now having listened to it, the stars of track and field, and Judy and her dream of horses, for me, are really the radio-worthy listenable catchy tunes. The stuff in between is, you know, indie-shlock, blah blah twangy nothingness. Though, don't get me wrong, would be very suitable for say, trying to seduce 20 something, depressed, slightly higher than average IQ, lonely, journal keeping, liberal arts degree program dropouts. (note: For Engineering degree dropouts, DEVO Hardcore Vol.2 suits this purpose) Oh, and hey, what's the deal with the singer? He sounds like a disaffected English guy with a cleft palate and a hare lip, who has a predeliction for baby talk. Don't get me wrong though, it really works on those two songs 
 My 20 month old son is speech delayed and I bought this DVD based on all the positive reviews I've seen.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I thought it was horrible.  First of all, it barely held my son's attention.  But the worst part was that I absolutely cannot stand the music!  I could barely make it through watching it even the first time.  Same thing with volume 2.   We bought the Baby Babble DVD about 6 weeks ago, and I think it is much better than these Bumblebee DVD's.  My son can watch Baby Babble over and over and over again.  
 A supposedly compassionate human being who boasts of a dog changing his life and then opting for the death of the dog...it is mind boggling to me, I can't believe it....but it is selling his books and I think it is cruel to the reader.  The world has enough tragedy, we don't need this 
 The work of Duncan J. Watts was admittedly inspired by the work of social-psychologist at Harvard University, Stanley Milgram, in the late 1967 on experiment on the problem called "small world" problem: "anyone person in the world could be reached through a network of friends in only a few steps; in Watts language, "after the cocktail party banter in which two strangers discover that they have a mutual acquaintance and remind each other what "a small world" it is. Surprisingly, Milgram's results led to the phrase "six degrees of separation": the degree of network of friends between me and you will never be more than six! I know someone who knows someone who knows someone else who knows someone that knows someone who becomes my friend!  I feel a must to urge the readers to read the book in order to understand further what science of network can give us. Among the popular books of networks, reading Watts' Six Degrees is important since the book was made seriously by the author for unlimited readers. It is a time for physics gives something valuable on constructing new scientific sociological work to day.   Hokky Situngkir Bandung Fe Institut 
 I read this book during the break in seasons 2 and 3.  Besides the thorough section devoted to the producer's influences--the parallels to "The Stand" and "The X-Files" are interesting--it was a waste of time.  It left me wondering what audience they were targeting with this book--huge Lost fans who are involved in the intertextuality of the show know all of this already, and casual fans won't be bothered by buying books.  I also noticed that there is no speculation whatsoever in the book, and that it sticks to the basic facts that we all know already.  Plus, it was written before the last episodes of season 2, which are critical to "unlocking" any meaning behind the show.  Don't buy it 
 Although the setting and factors involved appear to be intriguing they just come off as "boring".  The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary.  I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works.  But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over.  I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to.  Too bad - I know I won't buy that one.  I LOVE to read and "consume" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule.  Yet, I've been "trudging" through this one for weeks - not days 
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 Michael Seid's extensive experience yields some useful insights and he explains many of the steps involved in franchising, but the book reads too much like advertorial and Seid spends way too much time trumpeting his own accomplishments. (Wendy's founder Dave Thomas' contributions to the book are woefully slim and including him as a coauthor seems to serve more as a marketing tool.) Franchising for Dummies would be a worthwhile addition to your library on the subject, but if you're looking for a single, objective, authoritarian source on the subject, keep looking 
 I am so happy to see that other people realize what a pile of crap this so-called "classic" is. I read it about twenty years ago and even then recognized what a fundamentally phony book it was. A book on images of America in rock and roll, huh? Well, let's see, who's missing here?  CHUCK BERRY -- not a word.   BRIAN WILSON -- nothing.   LIEBER AND STOLLER -- nothing.   BOB DYLAN -- nope.   EDDIE COCHRAN -- zero.   Griel Marcus is the kind of guy who thinks he can make anything sound classy by comparing it to Huckleberry Finn. And not the text written by Mark Twain, either. No, that might mean having to quote and cite evidence. Marcus loves to talk about the "myth" of Huckleberry Finn, like the culture created it. No,  as Huck tells us on page one, "that book was written by Mr. Mark Twain." And you know what, Griel bubbe? You -- ain't -- him!  Most of the music Marcus actually writes about in this book is fifth rate crap nobody ever heard of. He doesn't review big hits because then the reader could actually critique his views and compare his raving with what the songs actually say. Harmonica Frank was a nobody, a non-talented non-entity, but Marcus gives the guy a full chapter so that Marcus can say whatever he wants without any contradictions. It's the dumbest form of elitism and one-upmanship masquerading as populism.   Another problem is Marcus' sentimentality about violence. Note well that this is a coward who wouldn't have made it through Army basic, let alone combat in Vietnam, yet he writes page after page after page about how joyous and invigorating it is to listen to songs about Stagger Lee shooting Billy, and rednecks slashing each other with razors, and God knows what else. Forget drugs and groupies, this is true rock and roll decadence.   The best part of the book, as most critics admit, is the section on Elvis Presley, pretentiously named "The Presliad." Elvis was no Achilles, and Griel Marcus is no Homer. Elvis was a coward, a liar, a weakling, who despised his audience and betrayed his music every chance he got. Marcus never comes close to owning up to Elvis' failures as a man and an artist. Elivs sells his soul to the devil, or to Nixon, and somehow it just makes Elvis more of a victim. Why can't Marcus admit that Elvis was trash? The music was good, sure. But the man was trash. Marcus isn't adult enough to handle that kind of contradiction so he falls back on endless babble about Ahab and Huck and the American "myths" that are not written down, not subject to rational discussion, and in fact seem to exist only in Marcus' head.   And they call this rock criticism

 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 This book simply throws ideas out that are simply ridiculous. I think I'll be lucky to make use of more than 2 or 3 of these monsters. The only ones that are remarkable are the new giants (and seriously you'd have to plan a whole campaign to make these fit somehow). Unless you like to throw random monsters at your players (which is a lame way to DM and is even more boring than fighting the same monsters again and again) this book is just too bizzarre. I'm agonna avoid MM4 too. With this trend, the new monsters could be nothing other than preposterous 
 The information in this book is suited for no other disasters than a  minimal nuclear accident. The information is old., dated and poor 
 I will not repeat what others have written here about this book... but I've really got to say it. THIS BOOK IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!  
 My suggestion to other readers is - do not waste your time or money on this book! When the big 30 began to approach I ordered the book from Amazon. I couldn't wait to tear into it. Unfortunately, I was very, very disappointed. The best part of this book is the cover, and that's no lie. I ordered this book thinking I would get good information and it would be funny. Instead all I learned was that you can string together pages and pages of drivel. With the constant hysteria about turning 30 in this book, it will make you have a mental breakdown.  The book feeds into this false culture of fear.  Also, the book reads like a college term paper - a bad college term paper 
 This text does not attempt to show that Darwinism is false, at best it succeeds in showing that certain applications of the theory are incorrect.   Evolution is not a "religion for adults" - it is a complex theory that should not be debated by those who do not know it. Simply because there exist statements about the theory (or statements made by the proponents of the theory) that are perhaps false, does not mean the entire theory is.  Has anyone heard of Richard Dawkins? He clearly showed how evolution can and has created cooperative systems.   Everyone - please educate yourselves from a well-balanced mix of texts, understand what the author's points are, and more importantly, reason about what is said - there are authors that care more for the money made from publishing a book, than the honest science and research that should go into it 
 I tried this knife at Sur La Table at the Furi demo. They appeared to be very sharp. However I did not like these knives for the following reasons  1) I dont care much for the cheap plastic-like orange handles   2) The finish on the knives appear to be cheap. Furi implies that these knives are made in Germany. However they are cheaply "Made in China". Now generally I dont care that much .. everything is now made in China anyways.. But when I am paying so much money for a product, I was hoping it was made in Germany or USA.  3) The case is even more cheaply made.  Personally, I would wait for a sale on the Global or the Wustof knives 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 I've been a reader of Georgette Heyer books for quite some time now and I adored most of her novels. However, I was really disappointed with this one. If you expect a traditional Heyer novel, you also will not like it very much. The story is boring and I really had a hard time continuing the book. However, if you're intersted in history, and especially in English history at Lord Wellington's time then you probably will enjoy the novel very much, because Heyer gives a very specific account of the war on the Iberian peninsula against the French. Nervertheless, it is not a novel that I would recommend 
 Buyer beware: this program will critically impair your system!  Internet loading will be drastically crippled.  Expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes.  There is NO WAY to close McAfee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall.  I am going to return this first thing next week.  I gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades, but nothing has changed.  If only I had read the reviews ahead of time.   Bottomline: if you don't mind these side-effects, by all means purchase this program;  McAfee has solid protection.  But there are easier ways to get that protection 
 There is no bibliography in this book; it is an opinion of a couple married for 20 something years and their experience. If I want someones experience, Ill ask them .It seems anyone can publish a book. I would never recommend this. My therapist even panned it. One star is an over rating. It wasn't helpful advice at all 
 First I saw the stage play then too long ago saw the movie.From the opening scene where our "hero" turns the page of the book on "How to succeed in business" you start smiling and think : Oh yes! if only in real life it was so easy. Then you are swept in our hero cunning and coniving ways to get to the top. Love him or despise him,you are hooked. Great songs,great sets,great film.Loved it when he meets another ladder climbing opponent and the clever way he beats him,also the scene with the knitting is quite so over the top you cannot help yourself but love the guy. Top marks. LF PS My mark was for 5 stars.Somehow it was saved with only One star 
 Imagine a book in which Grandfather is a rabbi, Grandson is an alterboy, and they are described as "of the Quaker faith." You would still not be as far from the truth as this book. Sure it's a "heart-warming" tale. Many cultural inaccuracies are conveyed through heart-warming stories. For more detailed reference on the problems with this book, see:  Slapin, Beverly, & Seale, Doris. (1998). Through Indian eyes: The Native experience in books for children. Berkeley: University of California American Indian Studies Center.  Also check out www.oyate.org for other Native books to avoid 
 This could be a useful source on several different levels, but there are some problems in the text that may confuse the average reader. The book is designed for readers to better understand the basics of the Balkan Crisis.  However, the reader must understand a good deal of history (a little more  than a college survey in Western history) in order to fully comprehend the  method the authors use to describe Bosnian History. Furthermore, the book  contains too many generalizations and not enough details. Evidence is  rarely given to support their conclusions or defend their position from  other theories. Definitions on some key pharses are lacking in the text  itself when the reader encounters it for the first time. A glossary is  provided but the information there should be mirrored, at least partially,  in the body of the text. I do hold that the authors are well studied and  educated, and that their conclusions *seem* correct. But I need some  documentation and evidence that should be contained in their arguements in  order to trust in their conclusions 
 After reading two of the author's books Mohammad and Jesus; Islam and the Jews I find that the author is simply promoting anti-Islamic propaganda veiled by doubtful academic umbrella.   I could not verify whether he really was granted a PhD by Alazhar University since his real name is not to be revealed.  Selective quotations from any book holy or otherwise -originally written in a language foreign to the targeted market and audience - throws doubts especially  if the author has vested interest in leading to a certain result.  Hatred among people is the natural result of the circulation of such books.    
 The book came to me severly damaged before it was even packaged.  The first 313 pages were severly gouged out of the bottom pages about 1/4" deep x 1/2" x 1/2" (inches), close to the spine.  I did not have time to return it because my course started Jan. 10, 2006 and the Delivery estimate was:  January 6, 2006 - January 10, 2006.    I am very disappointed with this product and purchase 
 The positive about PCcillin is that it seems to work okay.  It scans email and the firewall works okay.  The negatives: - It supplies a lot of warning requests.  This would be good, but they aren't explained in an easily understood dialog so you end up answering yes to permission requests without always knowing if that's the best choice. - Even though it supplies 3 license keys the program is a little buggy and sometimes loses the keys.  If it loses the keys it disables the ability to update or click the customer service live chat button.  The process of restoring the key on the computer isn't too hard, but requires a bit of assistance from customer support. - Customer service is slow.  Sometimes I've been lucky and gotten into support chat right away, but sometimes I've had to wait 40 minutes or more.  The support personnel don't seemed to be trained technicians, but just phone support people reading through a manual with canned answers.  Getting to the right answer can take a long time and a lot of trial and error.  I have used PCcillin for about 2 years now.  The latest version definitely isn't as good as it's previous versions.  I wouldn't recommend this product 
 I was looking forward to using this cookbook as the idea of preparing dinner early in the day and having it ready and waiting for me at six o'clock was extremely appealing.  However, I have been extremely disappointed.  All the entrees I have tried have been, in my opinion, overcooked.  Sadly, I am coming to the conclusion that most foods were not meant to be cooked 6-7 hours.  Most of the recipes I tried were a bland mushy mess and there is not one that I would subject my family to again.  My last and final attempt was the Chicken with Beer which was both dry (due to the required baking for 20 minutes in the oven after 3 to 4 hours in the slow cooker on high) and tasteless.  Much to my amazement, one prior reviewer actually liked this recipe!  So maybe its just me.  In any case I am considering givin the slow cooker to Goodwill, along with this cookbook.  There has got to be a better way to simplify the chaos of dinner time preparation 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 if you've been a fan of zorn's stuff for a while now, and have had this creeping feeling as of late that he seems to be releasing everything but recordings of his own farts, this record isn't going to do anything to boost your confidence.  another release that talks about how highly artistic it is, yet seems to have very little soul.  very little that makes you want to come back for more.  what's on here is interesting - and sometimes quite good - but honestly there aren't many 'sparks' to be found here.  in ten years nobody's going to list this as a zorn classic, that's for sure.  i love zorn, and really like some of the far out stuff he's done in the past - be it in the realm of jazz, ambient, chamber, etc. but i'm starting to get the feeling that he's creating albums to fulfill some type of experimental checklist in his mind rather than follow his musical intuition.  and in the process he's recently put out more than his share of "interesting but not captivating" albums.  here's another one.  i'm becoming very skeptical of tzadik releases as a result, which is unfortunate.  this is of cursory interest by zorn standards, heavy metal standards, experimental standards, and so on.  you're much better off exploring his better works - there are a lot of them 
 The author seems not to understand that *readings* of novels -- by contrast with brief synopses of plot -- require alertness to tone, nuance, subtlety, and genre, which in turn requires some understanding of the literary traditions behind the novel in question.  While the legal history recounted in Goodman's book is intelligible, if highly arguable at some points, the literary analysis is nearly vapid.  Her arguments generally take the form of announcing that the law of torts concerns itself with anxieties about the relation between cause and effect, and then informing us that the plot of the novel under consideration -s -- surprise -- concerned with precisely that.  The idea that such anxieties might be differentiated or qualified on the basis of characterization, or the extent of narrative intrusion or absence, or the novel's negotiation of its relation to other books in the same genre -- all these possibilities go unregistered.  One would hope that the benefit of having both a JD and a PhD is that they would enable the author to combine the talents of two different disciplines -- but this does not happen here 
 The good news is the watch's case is quite nice. Now the could-be-improved points. It's sized weird. It's a lot larger than you think. Add to that it's bracelet is rather small so now that I removed a single link I can barely get it over my average sized wrist, and once it's on it's still too loose. Weird , but true. Frankly it's good looking, but I don't think I'll get another one. 
 -Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or "ON WAR" has completely missed the point here.  -The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or "On War" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.  -The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?   -That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of "ON WAR".  -Its the ECONOMICS, stupid ! 
 House did not write this book for Little League coaches who want to help their kids.  It is loaded with hyper-technical jargon that House does not explain and won't make sense to experienced players and coaches.  For example, in a section on how to pitch off a mound, House states, "A pitcher must find and keep an upper body spine-to-hip relationship with a constant angle of flex in posting knee at front leg lift, stride and landing -- directing upper body into torso rotation and launch of a baseball."  What? His science may be correct, but you won't benefit from this book because House does not translate the science into common sense terms that ballplayers will understand 
 Simon Schama is a brilliant man. He knows Rembrandt, Holland, Rubens and many topics backwards and forwards. But he has no dramatic sense. He has no gift for compression. And his prose vacillates between insiteful and  flatulent. So reading this book becomes a very long and tiresome chore. I'm  no expert on Rembrandt, but I have read better analysis of the paintings in  other books. Overall, a tiresome and uninspiring effort 
 Overall Bernanke does a good job at looking at different theories, but his theories on the dangers of deflation have been refuted by many authors. It is too bad that this theory clouds his vision, or else his treatment of the depression would have a lot more authority.  For the economist, I would highly recommend "America's Great Depression" by Murray N. Rothbard. He is by far the most thorough in his treatment of the period, delivering the most compete and well founded theory for the cause of the Great Depression, too bad Bernanke hasn't read it 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL 
 This book reflects a reality in Israel to which you - the reader - are an unsuspecting party: a battle for the soul of Israel between religious and secular, conservatives and liberals, friends and enemies of the state.  From my perspective - a recent Oleh in Jerusalem - this book could not be more skewed to the political and social left.  In every chapter, assuming there is potential, the author finds a way to skewer observant Jews, accusing them of everything from warped sexuality to outright racism.  One example is an account of the Shas Party's anti-Russian campaign, presenting them as an expression of religious Jewish Israels..... without ever explaining that the Shas party is the expression primarily of very religious Mizrahi Jews and does not even remotely appeal to the greater Orthodox community.  Statistics are also highly inaccurate: bandied about is this strange statistic that 500,000 Russian Olim are non-Jewish, when in reality it is closer to 330,000 and includes those who consider themselves Jews but do not meet the halakhic definition of such.  Russian immigration has plummeted, recently, from 100,000 per year during the nineties to something like 3,500 per year, now.  The author is pitching one more stone in the camp of pluralistic, pro-Palestinian liberal Israelis, hoping that you'll join in the quest to remould Israel in the cast of liberal American wishes.  Do yourself a favor: don't bother with this one 
 I agree with everyone, the soundtrack has got nothing to do with the movie.  but if you were like me, looking for that tune from the bar, its called Everybody Look the Same by Groove Armada, and you can get it off the soundtrack for the Movie the Next Best Thing, with Madonna and Rupert Everett.  Or you can do like I did, and download it....you know where from 
 First, let me say I wanted to love this book. The first O'brien book I read was The Things They Carried, a masterpeice. I suggest to all who were turned off by July July to please read this before writing him off. He has enormous talent, but this book didn't show any of it. The characters are barely credible. The setting of the reunion seems as if the characters dropped into a twilight zone scenario: they can and do haunt the Darton Hall campus in the wee hours, no buildings are locked, no security guards are ushering them out of the door, as if the campus is a ghost town, a mere prop waitng empty for thirty years instead of a real place with a whole new set of students. The dialogue of most characters not only sounds the same, but has the same style in that many scenes end with a character emitting what is meant to be a clever quip. On a more positive note, the sub-tales are mostly quite good, such as David Todd's tale in 'nam (I loved Johnny Ever, the most interesting character in the book), the tale of the lover who drowns (reminded me of a story by Richard Ford), and most of all Marv's tale. Tim, if you are reading this don't be discouraged. I know you have some better stuff in you. Maybe you got a little lazy or contrived on this one. Best of luck on your next effort 
 I'm in awe about what this program can do, but I've yet to be able to use it to its fullest. It's not user friendly and I've been designing photo brochures, and marketing literature and multi-media presentations for years with other design software.  The Corel_Tutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects. It takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program. And if you don't use it daily, it's easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons.  I was hoping the "student & teacher" edition would be more instructive, but it's not.  I'm currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a hands-on approach 
 Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are good, but Xenocide disappoints; in fact, Card could've ended on Speaker.  Instead he takes the worn path of Lusitania for his setting again.  In Xenocide, Ender must deal with numerous impossible tasks such as solving faster than light travel, averting the destruction of Lusitania by Starways Congress, stopping a war between the humans, piggies and formics, and saving the life of an electrically based lifeform, all the while contending with his messed up adopted family of geniuses.   And Card solves all these problems neatly.  What annoyed me most was Card's sudden use of italics to gain emphasis in speaking parts.  With such overuse of this device, I found myself giggling at the melodrama - and taken out of the story. Oh well.  Card, you've got talent, and I love Ender, but 'cide should've taken Ender to a new place 
 I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty  sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist 
 The normal elements of an Anita Blake novel (supernatural detective work, exciting action, and Anita's strong will) are reduced and pushed aside in favor of gratuitous sex scenes.  There's nothing wrong with a little romance, especially if it advances the plot.  However, these repeditive scenes are about as romantic and subtle as a sledgehammer.  They don't contribute to the plot, but instead interrupt it.    The excuse is that Anita has been infected by the ardour, a supernatural hunger for sexual energy.  Supposedly she got it from Jean Claude, even though it was never mentioned in the previous nine books.  It's a very flimsy plot device.   More annoying is the change in Anita.  Always before, she fought stubbornly to maintain her morals against all influcences.  However, she makes no attempt to resist the ardour.    The book is so different in focus, flow, writing style, phrasing, and word choices that I suspect it was partially or entirely ghost written.    I greatly enjoyed all the Anita Blake novels prior to this one.  I recommend reading those.    I advise against reading this one 
 This book had some interesting half-baked ideas about society, but it felt like a bunch of stories thrown together, straining for connection.  I didn't really like or relate to anyone in the book, and felt vaguely depressed upon finishing it.   I wish I had stopped reading in the middle.. 
 I Like This Album, Especially The 10th Song "Crime Of The Century".  This Song Is Fun, And I Like It.  I Typed The Lyrics On My Computer.  In August 2002 I Sang The Song At The Boys And Girls Club Staff Member.  Some Of The Staff Members Like This Song.  I Hope I Will Sing This Song At School If There Is A Talent Show At Schoo 
 I'll keep this review short and sweet.  This book is an in-depth academic discussion of how humans see and perceive things.  Although there were some interesting tid-bits throughout the book, I wanted to learn how to improve the composition of my photographs, and didn't find anything of use.  This book is probably well-suited to a graduate-level psychology course, but for me it has little applicability to photography 
 Carl Becker once unknown to me became the bane of an entire class of students as we explored in horrifying depth how Becker writes about the 18th and 19th centuries. In this book you are subjected to a historian who  tries to catalogue philosophy and the philosophers of the 18th century in a  poor blend of factual history and intepreted philosophy. The book is laced  with so much cynicism that it becomes hard to scry which sections Becker  stands behind and which he pokes fun at. After the unfortunate ordeal of  reading this book you will see that Becker had a loss of faith at some  point in his life and feels that everything around him is now meaningless,  therefore he turns to the past to seek new meaning and redemption of his  now useless life. What we find instead is a convoluted text which seems to  be hailed as wonderful by religious zealots for its admonishments of  science, philosophy, and history as empty in the grand scheme of the world.  He contradicts himself so often that only after you pore over his text can  you even decide what he supports. My opinion: skip the book and bash your  head into the wall. You will get about as much satisfaction 
 The washcloths are "ok" but I was really expecting a thicker more absorbent washcloth that holds a lot of soap while in the shower. Good for the money I guess 
 This book's story AND title is a ripoff of the TERRIBLE and RIDICULOUS script the character of Donald Kaufman writes in that movie.  It is unbelievable that this guy seriously wrote the same story and that so many people are taking him and it so seriously.  It's like Metallica releasing their black album.  Hadn't they seen "This is Spinal Tap"  
 Practical Geostatistics breaks new ground in providing excellent interactive media to supplement the text.  In fact, there is more information in the hyperlinked text on the enclosed CD then there is in the text book.  The CD is full of colorful 2-D and 3-D renderings and visualizations of various example data sets.  Regretfully, the text focuses more on the visualization techniques then on the art of evaluating spatial data.  There is little or no discussion of the mathematical concepts behind geostatistics.  The worked examples show excellent summary visualizations for the provided data sets, but do not walk the reader through the processes of semi-variogram analysis, cross-validation, kriging, or stochastic simulation.  I would recommend this book as a reference for someone interested in presenting geostatistical data evaluations using informative visualization techniques.  If the reader is interested in aquiring an understanding of geostatistic, I would instead recommend the texts by I.Clark, P.K.Kitanidis, or C.Deutsch and A.Journel 
 I was very much looking forward to this book, but it was a major disappointment. I was expecting a piece of work of the same quality as the Ships of the Line calendar. Instead the renderings were muddy, poorly anti-aliased and lacking in any kind of dynamics. The renderings were further marred by being double-page spreads. To actually see the rendering properly you would have to break the spine of the book. Included with each entry is a pointlessly geeky wireframe model of the ship. The text is the one bright spot in this otherwise poor product. These guys are capable of much better work. I can only hope that in 2002, the long awaited Unseen Federation will be up to their previous quality levels 
 Did not enjoy the book format of the book. Why? It tries to achieve too much. Combining Self-help Content on Pop Finance, and a Novel inside on Wealth Hunting.  The point sizes of the words inside the book are terribly small (paperback!). I found the reading experience filled with ideas jumping around.  Read " Learn to Earn" is much much better 
 robin trower has really lost a lot of his playing ability, same sound but no blazing licks and just a lot of trickery. two stars for the music and his new vocalist is quite good 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" puts this novel to shame. It has an interesting premise, but it's so unbelievable (even for fiction!) that I could hardly get through to the end. Gregory is a capable writer, so the descriptions are good, but despite some promising fictional characters (like Hannah), I found the novel dead boring 
 Before all the Graham Hancock fans out there get twerked off at me for the low  2 star rating on this book...hear me out.  Go back and read my 5 star Fingerprints of the Gods review and you will see that I consider Hancock a genius of sorts.  The man is brilliant.....too brilliant. But in Fingerprints Graham clearly latches on to Einstiens theory of Earth Crust Displacement as researched by Charles Hapgood. but in Underworld  that seems blown by the wayside. His work here and his conclusions seems like a book that someone who is writing a version of history that relegates Fingerprints to the sidelines would write; only problem is...both books were written by the same man.    There is a really fascinating book within the pages of this mass patience warping accumulation of information.  Hancock just over did it this time.   Here is what I mean: In Fingerprints of the Gods you can do a neat trick...just pick up the book and open it to any section on any page and you can start reading and be totally fascinated by the subject.  Fingerprints  is that good. Almost every sentence is riveting!!!  Underworld is at times as boring as a government information manual.   Huge sections of information about Hindu gods blah...blah...blah...TOO MUCH Graham....  There are sections of Underworld (if you are willing to look for them) that are just mind boggling in what they present and propose...but you will have to approach the book as if it were a raw manuscript and you were a tireless editor.  Perhaps Hancock is a big and powerful man in publishing now and no one is willing stop and say...."Hey Graham lets just put half of this in the woodstove and heat the house for a few days!"   Hancock is one smart puppy...no doubt...and I suppose there is no crime in going through life knowing more than you need to...but there is something that seems vaguely sadistic about making folks listen to everything you know or can find out about.  In Fingerprints, Hancock seems at times impatient and indignant with the arrogance of the establishment and their often ludicrous assumptions and declarations.   Yet in Underworld, there is a definite and distasteful undercurrent of Hancock's own arrogance....a side of him that is not complimentary to the theories and information he is trying to present.  Drunks babble on in this manner a lot, and intellectual drunks are the worse...but if Hancock was sober when he handed this megalithic manuscript in....then perhaps it was some cowardly Editor who in a drunken stupor said, "Hey....looks fine like it is! 
 The book helps me to "reorganize" all the information that I have learned before (Word & Excel). A few tables are informative but almost the 80% of the content are not helpful, such as guiding you through step by step on how to make things work. If you are an Advanced Microsoft Office user, such as you are advanced in Excel or Word, you might most probably thinking this book is useless. I skipped most of it and I am so tired of reading this book simply because I need to pay an extra affort to filter out the things I knew. Too wordy and the instructions are not clear when guiding you through. Not worth to spend your money on it 
 I saw a performance of the Silk Road Ensemble and was absolutely enthralled.  So I bought the CD.  But it was a big disappointment.  It's not the type of music you can comfortably listen to in your living room - I'm sure it would be much more enjoyable in a concert hall.  There was far too much that just sounded like "screeching" to me.  However, some of the pieces that were much like what we heard at the performance were beautiful.  So - a mixed review, but I disliked more than I liked 
 "Pity the Nation" is more a diary of Fisk's travels and experiences in Lebanon than a history of the Lebanese Civil War.  Fisk vividly describes events he sees, but what occurs beyond his literal field of vision is undocumented. As an example, Fisk spends four chapters discussing the 1982 Sabra and Chatila massacre, but only two pages on the 1985-1988 War of the Camps (where Amal killed more Palestinians than Elie Hobeika).    Fisk brings to life a few of his reporter friends, but the main political actors of the war are only described from a distance 
 of these books where grown women get themselves into bad situations, stay there for too long and then expect sympathy for whining through a book.  Yes, Vivian is impossible.  Claire knew that before she started.  so....why am I supposed to have sympathy for her when she sticks it out this long?  I understand that Claire is supposed to be somewhat naive at the beginning and also sheltered in that she has been protected from bad workplace situations.  however, she -  hears a lot of rumors and doesn't check them out.  acts impulsively by quitting suddenly  stays in the new job way too long.  the author has trouble even coming up with a convincing excuse for this.  fails to examine her own behavior.  If she came out and said, OK I'm in the book business no matter what, I'll put up with this, I am making a choice here - that would be one thing.  but she portrays herself as the innocent victim and that's ridiculous.  the workplace is definitely not fair and there are abuses but to say that Claire is powerless is absurd.  She is a young, able-bodied, physically and mentally healthy single woman.  I would have a LOT more sympathy if she had a couple young children to support as a single mother.  the romantic situation I found absurd as well.  Her attraction to the guy was based on superficial factors, such as a long-ago crush and his good looks and success, yet somehow the relationship difficulties are his fault only.  ugh 
 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 I think Dr. Laura should title her next book "The Secret of My Success: Stupid People."   Julie Townsend, Metairie, L 
 how come this book thinks school is about...boys,firneds,hot outfits.thats not how my school is.some schools have unforms.and shool is not about hot clothes.school is about larening things not makeing things 
 I bought an O'Reilly book to teach myself perl & it was great. I'm writing a review about this one because I'm frustrated. The first six chapters go by like a breeze for folks familiar with other programming languages (I use perl, mel, c, html, studio). well, that's not entirely true. I couldn't get my apache server to execute any of my php code (I'm on a new mac mini). I followed all the instructions in appendix A to no avail. Finally, I just uploaded my php scripts to a webserver & my code worked there. but that's super annoying because I have to upload my php file every time I want to test it (& sometimes my internet connection is slow). whatever. anyway: when I got to chapter 7 none of the examples worked anymore & it is extremely vague exactly how you're supposed to run some commands. for example: if you want to set up a database, you run the following command only one time:  CREATE TABLE dishes (     dish_id INT,     dish_name VARCHAR(255),     price DECIMAL(4,2),     is_spicy INT )  but where do you run it from? also, the book relies heavily on using extensions that weren't installed in my version of php. additionally, I'm not sure if certain examples are just there to demonstrate what should work, or things that actually work. ie: this code is supposed to connect you to a database:  require 'DB.php'; $db = DB::connect('mysql://penguin:top^hat@db.example.com/restaurant');  is that actually supposed to work, or is it just an example? if it doesn't work for me (which it didn't), then I have to figure out what's wrong w/my system etc.  another frustrating this is the book recommends using several commands (like running system commands) that my webserver doesn't allow for security reasons. this problem should at least be addressed in the book. hopefully, I'm not just frustrated with php itself because several of my coworkers swear by it. but I've had more luck tracking down answers to very basic questions online than finding them in this book 
 I found this story to be extremely elementary.  This Shakespeare fellow obviously has no idea what he is talking about, and I hope he refrains from releasing anything in the near future 
 This lifelong Cardinals fan managed to get through the book, but it's hard to imagine any non Cardinals fan who is not a speed reader doing the same. Though I am not an obsessive baseball fan (haven't seen a game even on TV for nearly 20 years), the in-game stategies Bissinger details are nothing surprising; in context, anyone, experienced or not, would seem likely to come up with them. Readers will learning virtually nothing here. To give Bissinger a break, it seems he agreed and perhaps signed a contract to write this book without realizing there would not be anything to say. Bissinger does not deserve a break for his criticisms of Lewis' "Moneyball," however. (The hardback edition of "3 Nights," perhaps, is not so strongly positioned against that far better book, but the paperback I read contains an afterword devoted entirely to trashing Lewis' book without (a) any understanding of it, (b) apparently, a rereading of it, and (c) any evidence whatsoever to butress Bissinger's "ya gotta have heart" position. Likewise, Bissinger deserves no break for the horribly bad, lazy prose here. Examples: Pujols is referred to in his first 20 or so mentions as "the great Pujols." No variations (not even "the really great") of the phrase are used. Page 275: a player plays "each and every game at five hundred percent." Page 254: a World Series victory is marked by a "Rubik's Cube of a hug." Page 243 (and elsewhere): "sultry hot," as if "sultry" does not imply "hot." Page 224: "white hair as finely woven as pasta." This is the kind of writing folks compose deliberately to win bad writing contests. Disappointingly, the paperback edition, at least, doesn't even have any pictures. Stay away from this one 
 A disappointment, largely because this biography seems to have mostly taken information from Asimov's own autobiographies. The author frequently retells the same stories, changes the words just a bit. Not recommended at all. Readers would be much better off reading Asimov's own books on his life, such as In Memory Yet Green, and In Joy Still Felt 
 No, no, no.  This is NOT a rousing adventure:  it's a good, quick read that ends of going flat real fast half-way through.  It starts off entertaining enough - even a jovial, skirt-chasing Herrmann Goering makes an appearance - and the first expedition to Antartica keeps your interest.  But then it's as if the author was under a rush to finish it, because it devolves into this strained romance that tries to be Hemingway.  By the last fifty pages I was plowing through it just to be done with it.  Such a shame:  now Nazi UFOs in Antartica - that would be a story 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
 This is not a pleasent book to read for people who really love cats. It is very depressing and not uplifting at all. I ordered this book, thinking I was going to get a cute cat book with fun stories about cats. Boy, was I  ever wrong. The stories are so dismal and depressing, they are all about  cats & kittens getting killed or dying from one reason or another. The  author even tells us a story about how she "had" to kill some new  born kittens, because she thought the mother cat was to weak to nurse them.  Well, she could have gone to the vet and got some formula and a dropper and  feed them herself. She shouldn't even be a cat owner, she doesn't even know  how to take Good care of cats. Also the author refers to her cats just as  black cat and gray cat. My cats are members of my family, they are my  children, and I gave them names. I don't refer to them as: orange cat, or  black and white cat, or tabby cat, etc. This book is just awful 
 This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one.  Besides, some of it is just plain wrong.  To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:  "In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general."    Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity.  He attributes to them, two "liberal" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with.  
 Not worth the time nor money. This book promotes the idea of buying real estate through WE BUY HOUSES signs and through ads in newspapers. Ideal for groups of investors who have plenty of time, capital and OPM to invest around the country.   
 I wonder how accurate the rest of the book is when the author, Mr. Kershaw, did not care to notice that Dawson City, the Klondike, and surrounding region are not in Alaska but well inside Canada. He makes these erroneous references often 
 Like many models getting started in the business, I didn't know which way to turn.  The hardest part is to qualify clients and to only work with those that will keep the image of you that you would like to promote in the market place.  This book really doesn't outline this aspect of the industry.  Good management is what got me a blossoming career in this business.  Thanks to Digital White Boy Management, http://www.digitalwhiteboy.com , I've made it in this industry 
 I think that Jessica Simpson is trying too hard to be like Britney Spears and Madonna. Truth is, she's no where NEAR Britney/Madonna status! Yes Jess does sing better than both Brit & Madonna combined together but I think that she needs to make something a little more original! The only album that I enjoy from Jess is Irressistable and the remix album. Other than that she totally sucks at making music. Half these songs are not original and it's pretty obvious that she has no talent at writing songs. If this album had a any orginality and showcases her voice on songs that are fit for her, then maybe I would've given it more starts. But for now, I suggest you skip this album and go buy Danity Kane or Christina Aguilera. And if you only wanna buy it cuz it's Jessica Simpson then download it! You'll hate yourself if you buy it 
 Though this three cassette audio version offers some sound ideas, they certainly are not anything worth your changing your life over, I'm not even sure they WOULD change your life.  Neither are they anything self-help lovers have not heard before or read before in some fashion. Also, read by the author Cheryl Richardson, these 3 cassettes tend to have a monotone that could lull the poor listener into a coma. On more than a few occasions, I wondered where the author came up with an idea, since in the next paragraph or later on another cassette, she would clearly relate a story of her own life that contradicted the entire idea she presented in the first place. In fairness, Cheryl Richardson makes it clear she was not intending to "practice what she preaches" when she does that, but it just leaves the listener confused.  I'm sure this was unintentional, but there's no therapy here folks 
 This must have been fun to record but it feels to me like they were just having a lark w/country music. As a result, it's competently performed, but bland in a sort of Country Lite kind of way. When famous musicians cross genres, it's more rewarding when they at least bring us something new, or dive in w/both feet and give us the texture of the new genre--I was looking forward to something more. Instead, it's like hearing a good country cover band in a Las Vegas lounge (nothing wrong w/that, but at least in Vegas the music is free).  There are many better country or folk or bluegrass albums on the market right now that are more rewarding than this. Start with, say, "You Don't Know Me - Songs of Cindy Walker," just released by Willie Nelson, a better example of how to do a tribute album. 
 i was told this movie was great, very humorous, but it wasn't. there were a couple parts that were funny, but the quality is terrible (even for a movie made in 1935). it hasn't been cleaned up or repaired at all and it's very, very hard to see. it's not worth the money in the slightest 
 And it was never meant to be. I'm sick of corporate fatcat traveling show preachers like Pat Robertson and Jerry Farright complain about this supposed "militant secularization of America". Gimme a friggin' break. Conservative christians have DOMINATED this country's political power for the greater half of the past 200 years in this country. It was only recently that people realized that not everyone in America was a caucasian christian with a fair amount of money that things started to change to accomodate everyone, and so the far right fundamentalists cried out in rage that their long reign was being disputed. Today, they act as if America has branded christianity public enemy one. Patty boy has even gone as so far to compare today's conservative christians with Jews in Europe as far as oppression goes! Yes, the Ten Commmandments have been removed....but so what? Do you see government troops raiding your house everytime you have a christian Youth Fellowship meeting? Are you threatened with execution on treasonous charges in America if a government official finds a Bible in your possesion? NO! But this is what real people in much less priviledged countries have to go through, and Robertson and his like should be ashamed to compare themselves to people who really suffer for what they believe. The America of old JAILED a man for simply teaching a science theory to a high school class. The America of today rightfully jails psychos who think that unborn fetus life is worth more than the lives of the doctors who are simply helping women from being butchered by a backalley thug with a coathanger.  America is not, was not and will never be a theocracy. A theocratic government is primitive, pious and dangerous. One need only look at Iran for such an example. Let's leave theocracies in the dark age where they belong and leave power-hungry false prophets like Pat in the trash 
 I don't feel that Miller made much of an attempt to prove that Anna was in fact a "good" mother. Like another reviewer said, I don't think she was a BAD mother, but the book really didn't go into much detail about Anna's relationship with Molly (especially up until Anna' ex-husband filed for custody) and instead focused on Anna's life experiences and psyche. After Brian said he wouldn't send Molly back, Anna didn't even seem that concerned about Molly's mental and emotional well-being. She just focused on her notion that Leo's actions were simply taken out of context, and while she wanted to see Molly again, I got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her "rights" as a mother, not out of a concern for her daughter.   And what was so great about Leo anyway?? He wasn't exactly nice to Anna, often condescending to her, and from the beginning I felt that his affection for Molly was a farse, simply to stay on Anna's good side. He also seemed sexually possessive of Anna--like the scene when he kept having sex with her after Molly came into the bed because of a nightmare. I think Anna loved her daughter, but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love, since she had never felt such an attraction before. As a result, her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for 2 months, with dire consequences. Although she did show some signs of remorse, she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter's welfare. If she had put her daughter first from the beginning, instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new "family" she and Leo were forming, then she probably never would have lost custody of her child. 
 If you liked Michael Eric Dyson's other works then you will love this.  It is essentially his standard "blame Amerika" rant with the words New Orleans, and Hurricane Katrina thrown in to render the work germane.  The interesting thing about this book is how quickly it was published after Katrina.  Given the length of time required to get a manuscript onto bookshelves, I calculated that he must have written this in the two weeks following the storm. Given that some of the "facts" he cites about Katrina can be shown empirically to be false, perhaps he should have waited just a little longer before jumping into the fray.    Another  blow to Dyson's neo-Marxist take on Katrina is the  Knight Ridder news story released  in December (2006) that showed the pattern of death and to a certain extent destruction did NOT occure on racial/class lines as Dyson would have us believe also casts doubt on his narrative (for example, as a percentage of population, there was a stronger correlation between age and death than race and death. If those found dead in nursing homes were factored out, as a percentage of population, more white people than black died. Can we then surmise that George Bush hates old white people? The main stream media, with few exceptions, did not pick up on this story because like Dyson, they had already decided the Katrina narrative and they are not about to let the facts ruin a juicy story.)  Those of you who know Dyson's work of course will know that he was probably chomping at the bit from day one to throw his opinion into the mix.    Anyone who followed the coverage of Katrina probably heard various religious figures blaming the evil nature of New Orleans for incurring god's wrath.  Offensive as these views may be, I was surprised that Dyson - a writer who is considered to be a first rate accademic by many - would wast a whole chapter refuting such arguments.  In fact, by even arguing against these positions he is giving them more credence than they deserve.  If any book about Katrina is to be taken seriously, it probably should not contain a whole chapter on the pros and cons of various theological interpretations of the disaster.  True, the author is an ordained minister but perhaps he should leave his views on divine retribution in the pulpit where they belong (it is also ironic that given Dysons neo-Marxist critical approach to race, etc. that he would even counternance the notion of god. let alone engage in the arguments he does here.)  So, if you are a fan of Dyson's, buy this book - you will be neither disappointed nor challenged (because you already know what he is going to say.) If you are interested in the state of contemporary leftist "academic" thought then this is a good read because it is far more accessible than the works of many of Dyson's peers yet encapsulates the narrow race/class/power/gender optic through which they view capitalism in general and of course this most wicked of nations, Amerika. 
 This is one of the seminal albums of the Two-Tone movement, but don't buy this castrated version 
 Dwyer evidently advocates abandonment of our constitutional rights to  freedom of religion, speech, and even thought within the family except as  it agrees with his profoundly held secularist dogma. This is an example of  the less than subtle propaganda available at the modern university. Arguing  from a decidedly elitist framework he proceeds to introduce a dichotomy  between parental and children's rights essentially substituting  "Big" and I mean really "Big Brother" as arbiter of the  child's best interest. It is fascinating to see the socialist mind at work  spinning arbitrary rights for the state elitists in a convoluted  destruction of private rights reminiscent of Bolshevik totalitarianism. The  fact that children are already suffering immensely in the hands of a  Kafkaesque bureacracratic welfare and foster care system hardly intrudes  the flowery idealism of the social engineer hard at work squandering our  tax dollars. After reading such a book all children and parents ought to  have increased appreciation for our Constitutional legal system which has  at least presently restrained such wild eyed extremism 
 As a soon to be full-time consultant, I was hoping that this book would provide me answers for the few remaining questions I have. Based on the other reviews, it appeared this book would fill in those gaps, though now that I have read it, I am sorely disappointed. The most annoying aspect of the book is that the author's primary aim seems to be to show off his grasp of the various fields within computer consulting and especially the terminology and jargon. Seriously, if I REALLY need to know what an ATM switch is, I can look it up in Newton's Telecomm Dictionary. Likewise, I do NOT need a primer on IBM mainframes and PC-DOS which haven't been relevant for over 20 years. I just want to know about "Getting Started" - like the title says. The sidebars are littered with these mostly useless definitions. In addition, the book seems to offer very detailed information in the table of contents, though once you read a specific section you realize the oasis is only a mirage. There's a heading called "Examining Your Strengths" which instructs one to do this without any suggestions on how to do this and how to interpret the results and choose a niche, yet choosing a niche is one of the main points of the book. Much of the information can be useful, yet an equal amount is either so simplistic or so vague I started yelling out loud at the book. Often the author will state things like "research indicates" without even citing the research. A lot of the marketing advice seems regurgitated from bad 1990's marketing books; clearly NOT the authors strong point. If you want to read a mind-blowing 1990's book on marketing a service business, read Harry Beckwith's Selling the Invisible. Finally, the book is very dated, being a computer-related book published in 2000. The annoying little sidebar definitions become more annoying with their staleness. I could hardly keep myself from smiling/groaning at the mention that Y2K consulting is still a growth niche 
 I was amazed to see that other people found this book helpful. I ordered it to put together a presentation seminar in Switzerland. I could not use anything from this dreadful compilation of trivialies. There is no structure, the author superficially jumps from one idea to the other. The situations presented are, for the vast majority of us, irrelvant and unworthy of discussion such as: how to act at a business apero, sneak out of a meeting, talk on the phone etc. (in fact, if the advice were good, it could conceivably be helpful in such an occurrance-- But I thought this was about presentations!!); the book tries to be a self-help guide, a fashion consultant, motivation pamphlet, and fails on all fronts. It has the intellectural firepower of 17 magazine, except I picked out much better tips from my sister's old magazines. The author seems to be a successful practictioner, which I found astonishing, that someone with a track record in the field of presentation coaching could write such an awful book. 
 This is the first review i've written and I just wanted to let people know that this in essence is a  good book....but only if your looking for drugs/medications as a priority to dealing with your hormonal problems. I ordered this book along with another book called "hormonal balance" and there's no comparing between the two. The other book talks indepth about exactly what your hormones do...and how they control your body. This book gives a short explanation followed by prescriptions that your doctor might advise...it has alternative treatments...but they are not very detailed...and focus more on "get more sleep....exercise....etc". All in all it's not a bad book...but there are definetly better one's out there 
 I don't know, but this book was not very useful to me 
 My apologies to all the Hemingway fans, but I didn't really care for this book. I had a hard time understand what was going on throughout the book. One bright spot was when they were in the mountains fishing and it is always nice to read of another country that is not yours. The characters did not appeal to me, I wouldn't want to party with any of them. They seemed lost and spoiled. Grabbing a quick peek at the Cliff Notes in a book store for this book; I found some of my conclusions were valid. But unfortunately it just wasn't for me. If you try this book I wish you luck 
 I recieved this book after 3 weeks and I had actually buy the same book from the stores. Now I have 2 books of same kind. Very bad experience 
 I am in complete agreement with the one other customer review that has appeared to date for this book.  The information offered is interesting.  However, this book was cheaply produced and apparently rushed into print to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the creation of Grant Wood's masterpiece.  The illustrations hardly merit the name, so murky they completely obscure the author's points.  And there doesn't seem to have been even the most cursory edit.  The frequent typos, grammatical errors, jumbled words are a major distraction.  Quite honestly, someone of Thomas Hoving's stature should be embarassed to have his name attached to this. 
 I'm a caver. I have been for close to thirty years. So when an occasional "caving" movie comes out, you know I GOTTA see it. Not because I have ANY hope someone will actually do research, or heaven forbid, actually consult REAL cavers. (NOT "spelunkers" mind you). I'm just curious. (Drive past that frightful auto accident and try NOT to look!)  Sadly, but predicably, this one does not disappoint to disappoint. I will say I wish cavers looked like that! Cripes, we ARE a gnarley bunch! Heck, I wish "I" looked like that! But alas, reality being what it is.....sigh! In it's defense, I will concede there was some good cinematography and nice diving scenes. I just wonder if anyone involved in the sets actually went INTO a cave and researched formations. I think not! It was not the WORST caving movie I've ever seen. (That honor would go to "The Cavern".) At least "The Cave" was shot fairly decently. I will say it's worth a look see. As for fellow cavers, buy the movie, get your grotto members together, buy copious amounts of adult beverages, and get ready to have a HOOT of an evening. Just make sure you buy "The Cavern" to go with it. That one is a HOWLER! Enjoy! BEWARE HODAGS! Now they're in the water 
 Playing tug-o-war with the good and bad clichés of current film-noirs, "Brick" both coasts on, and is derailed in its gloriously deft, yet non-atmosphere building visual eye; its own desire for one-noted, sometimes funny, but usually straight-faced characters; and an overblown, yet still somewhat interesting plot. Moreover, this detective story --set in a high-society Californian high school--trails the tired paths led by every crime-solving film of its ilk, yet the film has a playful humor inside its stereotypical mechanics, even if this knowing wink-wink makes it only think it's smarter than its own deficiencies.  "Brick" starts out in its opening frames with the typical, yet still adamantly interesting film-noir technique of giving the audience a quick glimpse of a major plot point, to only then flashback into a linear narrative. The film, about mid- teenaged Brendan`s (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) search into an underworld to find the answers of his girlfriend's murder, is actuated with this somber first shot of Brendan standing next to her dead body, thus creating a palatable sense of dread in the first act in which she is shown still alive. This also gives Levitt's street-wise character his future vendetta. Yet, this characterization through this revenge plot point never develops outside a stereotype, or even beyond this sun-drenched, and alarmingly too mirthful looking Sherlock Holmes world of lies and deceit.   The film lacks in the center of its heart, in the way that the Brendan character does not quite earn his credit as a jack-of-all trades, because of this non-existent and needed inner layer-- so that it becomes increasingly obvious, and especially irritating, that this puzzle-solving brainiac is used only to propel its over-the-top and purely cinematic plot along artificially. Since, interchanging the typical character's of film-noir with those in high school, seems no different than a child taking a painting, drawing on it with a sharpie,  turning around, and telling their parents they created an original piece of artwork. It is more novel to see the younger actors perform as well as they do, and have fun in the roles that are often played by ageing, burned out characters. Actually, the school setting is also more interesting, than necessary, in the way that it plays with conventions-- for instance, the school principal acts as the police chief this time around, while Brendan's only friend acts as a Dr. Watson sort-- yet still fails to hide that it is indeed aimed towards a younger audience, of which would rather see "Brick" acting like a chameleon in its shallowness, when more often than not, more knowledgeable viewers will notice that it only poses as something more complex than it really is.  And overtly complex it is, as well: featuring about seven central characters, and an abundant amount of monologue when it comes to these twists and turns. Although it is apparent what essentially is going on, there is also a lot of heavy handed explanation with too much "he said/she said," and confusingly contrived character conclusions about one another in conjunction with the plot.  The narrative goes through the regular mechanics of its genre, featuring sexist characterizations; as in both the masculine, drug addled, and violent males, and the sexy, harlot, lying, or damsel-in-distress females. Although the cast still plays there character serious enough that it does not wallow into complete self-mockery, but at the same time, there is a sort of modern gimmickry here, that instead needed to gel into a full-bodied and three-dimensional portrait of the events with more insight into the popularity warfare of high school that it often makes reference to. Yet these characterizations are so perfect in their regularity that they still appeal to the viewer, sometimes quickly developing in intentional scenes of comedy, from the slight comedic tweaking of its stereotypes; such as: the drug dealer who still leaves with his mother, the muscle with a too hotheaded personality, so that you cannot take it seriously anymore, and another character nuance features a bitchy theatre girl with a literal lap dog.   The conclusion here comes together a little simple, and as the rest of "Brick," the end is certainly not groundbreaking. Yet, many will find merits in the style by director/screenwriter Rian Johnson working with cinematographer Steve Yedlin, of which give the film the elegant look of a scenic painting, with some truly spectacular moments of directing, sight, and lighting; such as: an unlit chase through a drainage hole, the arrival of Brendan at the drug dealers' safe house, and a fist fight in darkness towards the end-- and it is in these little hints of something audacious that make it good enough to get one to wonder what lies in the future for these filmmakers. Yet, as far as "Brick" goes, viewers will agree that they wanted this one to make a louder sound when dropped onto the movie scene, as it rather falls quietly from grace.  ** ½ (Out of 5 
 I own all of these movies already and I can honestly tell you this collection is a rip off. They're asking way too much for so few movies. Now, you add a few more classics and make them all 2-disc special editions, then hell yeah I'll pay $500 for it. But this just isn't worth it, collection set or not 
 Worked fine for the first two days then I had to hold the switch down a little longer each day for it to light.  Ultimately it stopped lighting completely within 2 weeks.  Returned for credit and Amazon was great as usual 
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 It is minus a few changes the same as his other one 
 This is a really, really lame tome.  I'd earlier submitted two reviews that have clearly been censored.  Consequently, I am providing this mild rebuff.  Rest assured, though, dear reader that this is NOT a book on which you want to waste your moolah. Note too that if this review is posted it is only the second to appear in connection with this dreadful work.  Its not so much that the plot is ridiculous (well, yes it is)or that the characters are less than believable (they're absurd), but rather that the overall package is simply so far out there that one wonders why or how anyone could dream up this stuff.  It truly does read as if the ghosts of Franklin W. Dixon and Carolyn Keene got together for a wild party, consumed copious amounts of mind altering pharmaceutical grade drugs, and said "Hey, we're not doing anything, let's write a really cool and disturbing book".  Unfortunately, just like the amalgam that was those authors,  this reads as if a crew of hungover substitute Jr High School teachers had to complete an assignment under a deadline.  Truly, THIS review, as bad as it is, is infinitely superior to the flight of fancy that is "Keeping Counsel" 
 I really wish I had listened to the reviews before I had bought this, I thought it was the most unhelpful piece of absolute junk I have ever bought in my life. It was uninformative and had nothing I needed, I need to find a dropshipper for computer hardware, can anyone recommend anywhere,  and if anyone is looking for such a drop-shipper, don't buy this boo 
 Unbelievable. I mean come on, we're only talkin about a few minutes here.  Missing some of the funniest scenes in the 1st movie including the German Jacque Cousteau character scene.  I didnt even know the laserdisc version was an 'extended' version until now.  Thank god I still have the laserdisc.  Another incident of movie companies raping the public.  Grrrrrh.. 
 I've begun reading this book and I was sailing with Thomas Moore real tight.  He was skillfully sailing the ship until I got to his fourth chapter where he got off into a skiff and cut the rope.  He has set me adrift in a wide sea without a moral compass.    He leads his readers into the occult and astrology. A place where a former Monk should fear to tread. While I don't mind learning about insights of the dark night through greek mythology and other lesser known personalities, I feel Mr. Moore could have served his readers better examples by using concepts and personalities from the Judeo-Christian tradition.   Mr. Moore holds too highly the concept of self and self fulfullment.  What I understood from Part Two of the book "Disturbances" is don't take responsibility for your choices.  Follow what you feel you must do in order to develop your inner self and talents even it that means to destroy and hurt your relationship with family and friends.  Jesus' idea was in losing one's self that we find out true self.   I haven't finished the book yet so I guess it's a bit unfair to write a review so soon. However, I thought I would tear through this book because the first 68 pages held so much meaning for me.  I've gotten bogged down in the middle and have picked up another book by James Finley which is an expose of Thomas Merton's thought.  Merton's Palace of Nowhere -A search for God through Awareness for the True Self.  I love this book.  What I am discovering from Merton is that the self we construct is an illusion but we need to find our true self through our search and union with God.  I believe this is the true purpose of the Dark night of the Soul which is to lead us to the realization of our need for grounding in the source of life.  I have two more books by Moore which I plan to read. Care of the Soul and The Re-enchantment of Every Day life.  So stay tune 
 The first film was much better than R.E. Apocalypse; more gore, better acting, better presentation overall, and it was done with a lot less money 
 Another "feel-good" book directed at lesbians who insist fathers aren't necessary in the raising of boys. They are SO WRONG. Unfortunately, their guinea pigs are the children. The author limits her samples to white, upper class lesbians and single mothers. To say her sample is skewed is an understatement. 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 Too many notes, too much whinning , and the intro to "Diamonds and Pearls" is very weak and very boring...I expected more from a talent such as Princ 
 It gave me a headache. I found nothing enlightening about it. I subscribe to the belief that in truth there is beauty and simplicity. In science it can be a simple formula expressing a profound idea such as E=mc^2. I guess it's a great academic exercise for those who have the time. Where's the clarity. I subscribe the KISS concept. Life/being at least in the physical sense appears very short from where I'm sitting. I'd rather embrace life with joy and whatever form my being has taken and savor the time I have. That to me has real meaning. To each his/her own we will probably never know if we got it "right" or  will MH. Or perhaps he finally did 
 ... but doesn't really touch anything the new digital shooter would be interested in.  If you're shooting film and you're looking for a simple primer on low-light, it's not too bad. Be warned, however- it's a pretty basic book.  Apart from a good few pages on tricks with flashlights, and one or two truely stunning photos, it's a generally pedestrian take on the subject.  Digital shooters are advised to look elsewhere 
 I thought this book was about the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. This is not the book I was thinking about. It was a book written by Benjamin Franklin but which is written after he wrote his famous autobiography. The book did not contain the contents of his autobiography but contains his writings that were written during his last years that was not included in his widely read autobiography.  The book title says it is 'compleated' autobiography. The book's title should be 'Last memoirs of Benjamin Frankilin 
 Tony Morrison is an excellent writer. I simply anticipated more out of her before reading this book. Maybe it is my problem as a white male, but I expected more raw emotion from her characters or better insight on the people she wrote about, or, alas the plight of the African-American woman. Maybe that was the point of the book to show that all of these human emotions have been locked up due to terrible circumstance and treatment 
 This text is excellent in the coverage of its subject matter, but, like typical texts and journal articles written by a myriad of authors, it lacks coherence. Thus, separating the wheat from the chaff is tedious. The book, if well written, could be much shorter and more readable than it currently is 
 The quality of this isnt great- the sound of the "waterproof" material is loud.  I dont like the side material and think it will fall apart easily.  I would save your money and buy the more expensive one that has better quality.  
 I was severely disappointed in this recording.  I love military music of all kinds, but the unnamed group or groups on this recording failed to present this music adequately. On most tracks, the percussion was so loud that it was hard to hear the brass and winds, which was probably a good thing in a way in that both sections displayed serious problems with intonation and rhythmic integrity.  From now on, I think I'll stick with recordings by groups which aren't unwilling to put their names on them 
 the beats are hot as fu*k but the singing is just terrible. the beats are crazy on this disc but t-pain cant sing for his life at all. you can tell his voice is all metallic on his songs. but two stars for the beats. the lyrics aren't very good either 
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it 
 I loved these sheets when I first got them.  They look expensive and have a nice thick feel to them.  After laundering them in cold water by themselves once a week for 2 months they started to fade, and worse yet started developing spots of discoloration in a bright orange color on the pillowcases!  I have laundered these in Tide with NO bleach!  What a shame they did not hold up well 
 With "Death on the Nile," the producers of the A&E "Poirot" series can claim to have broken all ties with the original British program starring David Suchet, save the presence of the star. The qualities that made the original program endearing-the wit, the exquisite production design, the fastidious attention to detail, the superb character acting of both the regulars and guests-are gone. That is not to say that this new Poirot is completely devoid of redeeming qualities, just that they pale in comparison with the original series.   The novel from which the movie is derived provides one of Christie's more complexly interwoven series of plots and sub-plots. It is no coincidence that the late 70s theatrical version starring Peter Ustinov ran well over two hours, and even at that simplified the story considerably. This new adaptation effectively eliminates the motivations for murdering the victim for most of the characters, and even those with motivation are given barely a scene or two to express those reasons. There really isn't much going on at all except the central love triangle and Poirot's sage pronouncements on the sidelines.  Even so, the movie seems to be rushing to its conclusion, as if all involved had other commitments they were eager to fulfill. Even Suchet just seems tired of the part, racing through his summing up speech as if reading a laundry list. (And the screenwriters really should be shot for burdening Poirot with pensive regrets about his failed love life. If there is one thing true of Christie's Poirot, it was that he didn't give a hoot about emotional entanglements. This is a sentimental hack's notion of "deepening" a character best known for his airy aloofness.)  The compensations? Some nasty humor at the edges which may not be everyone's cup of tea. Some nice location photography, and the occasional odd bit of behavioral detail from some of the supporting players. Alaistair MacKenzie as the aristocrat going through a Marxist phase and Steve Pemberton as the mysterious Dr. Bessner stand out. At their best, they are within calling distance of the better character playing in the series, although in Pemberton's case, at least, the character has been stripped of any motivation, and thus is something of a gratuitous appendage to the mystery.  Otherwise, it's a depressing lack of distinction across the board. A&E would be doing all of us a favor by stopping now, while they are behind. 
 I have enjoyed extremely some other works by H. L. Davis, most notably the novel Winds of Morning, and the beautifully executed short story, "The Homestead Orchard." It was with pleasurable anticipation that I obtained Davis's prizewinning magnum opus.  But this monstrosity totally surprised me. The historical basis of Oregon's history and geography is two fanciful. The characters are not well-developed and are cartoonish. I can stand fantasy sequences (loved Dickens's Little Dorrit), but this exhausted my patience. I kept waiting to reach the good part. I should have given up after the first 100 pages 
 I thought the movie was disjointed, it lacked subject matter.  Very odd 
      Well I decided to buy my first Girls Gone Wild video (The Seized Video) and it was a waste of my time and money. I hope th other ones are better than this because it was useless. The girls were good looking no doubt but its not that long of a video, the camera guys are idiots and act like twelve year old boy's. I thought this was going to be a good adult video but it is way over rated trust me. Wasted my money and spent thirty minutes of my life I will never get back.  
 Upon my first experience with the Babysitter's club soundtrack i first interpreted it as an attempt to summarize the late oedipal complex (as outlined by freud) engendered in the psyche of most pre-pubescent feminist thinkers; i refer you to the song 'daddy's girl.'  'Hannah i locked you out' served as a comparable foil to this feminist view by accurately displaying the adolescent male point of view and as it pertains to the what most people refer to as "dating" (to use a colloquial term).  However upon closer inspection of the compositional arrangement i found the songs to be both trite and frivolous.  There failed attempt at a social realist portrait of comradary (in their so called baby-sitters club, if it can so be called) and serves only to portray a highly styalized and erotic display of repression and sexual angst is more reminiscent of the rococco style, renound for its total lack of philosophical basis.  As a result this cd, in my opinion, should not be viewed by any serious music concasseur.  Thank you 
 Another in the series of misadventures and deadbeat characterizations.  Stick with the FLASHMAN series, or anything by Swift, to see how this genre should be done 
 Among my favorite books is King Con!  I have bought many copies to give as gifts to friends.  I buy Stephen Cannell always hoping to find another King Con.  The best character in this book is a marmalade cat named Franco.  The plot goes off in many different directions! It never really hangs together.  The shoot-out at the end is ridiculous.  People who are supposed to be competent and intelligent make idiotic decisions.  Scully's wife (groomed to be head of Dectives at LAPD) is so sweet and kind and thoughtful (and dumb)! Would LAPD groom such a woman to be head of detectives?  Well, maybe in real life - but it just doesn't work in this story. Too many characters; too many subplots; racial stuff, gangs, Hollywood, the Mafia, family issues, movie making.  I thought Cannell must have had a deadline for producing a book and looked through his file of old ideas and threw a bunch together and did his best to contrive a plot to connect disparate ideas.  This book doesn't say anything, doesn't do anything.  It's a dud.  Don't bother 
 A confused film with stereotypes and a self-deceiving message that confounds statutory rape with a mid-life spiritual awakening. Check out the fantastic Aussie film from 1987, BLISS, (directed by Ray Lawrence) and you will see how AB is a weak, mixed-up reworking (from a writer who cut his teeth in TV sitcoms). The very last scene of AB is the true tip-off to the reality of the rip-off, compare the camera's heavenwards pullback and Spacey's final voiceover monologue. The lovely poetry of BLISS' last scene will, if you have even a vague pulse, bring real soul-tears to your eyes. You tell me.   PS -   I was moved at the final images of Annette Benning's wailing in the closet and her brief, gleeful smile on the Tilt-a-Whirl (black and white film is so underrated). So, there's a couple of stars for that 
 Dr. Arthur Guyton and Dr. John Hall fail in offering a comprehensive molecular understanding of physiology.  Although the general presentation of subjects is decent, it does not offer a thorough understanding of molecular events that occur to create what is observed macroscopically.  The diagrams are weak utilizing ancient graphs that do not serve to clarify difficult points, and the book is in desparate need of some schematics and flow charts.  Tip to Guyton and Hall:  today's medical students need more than just a cursory glance at the molecular basis of physiology.  And I would suggest to those reading to check out Berne and Levy and Ganong, the latter of which offers up much more detail than Guyton despite being a review text 
 Michael Moriarity is my hero! He is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion. He has done such great B-movies as this, Q, and It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive. How awesome is he?? Anyways, I think that this movie was hilarious! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously, thinking that it is going to be your typical movie. But you shouldn't because not only is this a B-movie, but IT IS supposed to be funny. My favorite part is when "the stuff" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it. Who would do that?? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened. So if you watch this movie, just sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth, don't be too critical on it. What I learned from The Stuff: Dairy products are evil! Especially if they come from with in the earth! If you like The Stuff, I recommend: Watching other B-movies, such as Island of the Alive 3, Zombi 3 and 4, etc 
  This book will be really useful for you if you're still living in 1975 and are only interested in justifying what you already think. It clear that while some individuals spoke presumptuously about 1975, the WTB&TS never officially made the statements that apostates claim. 
 This book was edited by Hienlein's wife, Virginia.  If you have read Tramp Royale, you will already have seen that Virginia seemed to be a vain and foolish woman, dull witted at best.  This book certainly affirms the dull witted concept.  It is overly catagorized, with many sub-catagories containing only one fragment of a letter.  As a result, a striaght through reading jerks you all over the calender and back again in the space of a few pages.  Very annoying.  This would have been a far better book if the fragments had been presented in the order they were written 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 The author has created poorly constructed and rather lifeless characters.  Although the author has imposed much passion on her characters they still seem plastic.  As for the story, well I'd rather read something else 
 The reception on this unit works fine.  Transmission however is a problem, no one seems to be able to hear me 
 A remake of the respected Japanese horror film "Pulse" featuring the hot young actress Kristen Bell (of TV's "Veronica Mars") sounded like a not-terrible idea to me.  So I was kind of looking forward to this movie.  But the Japanese original was subtle and unorthodox in plot by American standards.  There's not really a story as such, as much as a slow unfolding of a mood of dread, punctuated by gradually escalating shocks.  In this American redo the special effects run riot.  The Japanese version whispered its terrors; this movie hammers you over the head LIKE SOMEONE WHO TYPES IN ALL CAPITALS. The big case-in-point and the one that aggravated me the most was the famous shot near the end of the Japanese film, that confirms that the world is coming to an end.  It's a brilliant coup that is absolutely breathtaking.  The same shot shows up in this remake, but it's so surrounded by other tacky FX that its impact is completely lost.  And it's not even half as convincing or real-looking as the Japanese scene anyway, which is ironic because that probably cost a fraction of this one.  A bad job all around, and I'm only giving it an extra star because of the presence of Bell, who is so cute she almost makes it worth sitting through.  Almost. 
 This book has ok pictures but not that many drink recipes.  Get another book that has more substance and less "style," because there simply aren't that many exciting drinks in here.  If you don't know how to make a screwdriver without a recipe, I suggest you get a life 
 This book fascinates me because it was challenged by the NAACP in 1945 for its quiet exclusionary racism 
 OK... this book has action. However, it seemed to me that the action sequences were not written for the readers but rather to satisfy Author's need to be tedious and verbose.   Here is a question I want to throw at the people who read this book and gave it more than 2 stars.   "How did the military test Supernova to see whether it works or not in the first place before it was stolen?"   I sure as hell would love to know the answer to this question from the readers who are hyping this book and also the author himself.   This book is trash. Dump it and move on to the next one on your list 
 I watched this with my parents and didn't like Marlons mouth. Reading these reviews you would think he is a hero or something. He cusses at everything and takes his whole urban hip hop gansta attitude too far. What is cool about that? That whole lifestyle that everyone thinks is so cool is ruining my school AND my neighborhood. The rest of the movie was all right but Marlon made me feel funny with his use of profanity. Sorry, that's just my opinion 
 Charles Fort had intelligence, yes. But where do his theories stand now? For instance, his thoughts on the "raining frogs and fish" occurance goes like this: he denied the scientific theory that they were sucked up in a waterspout and made his own: that all lifeforms were created in a giant sargasso sea in the sky and occasionally intelligent aliens dropped them to Earth. He generalizes the entire scientific community in simple strokes, physicists, your doctor, astronomers, chemists, yes, he claims to debunk them all. Is evolution true to Fort? Nope, all life is created in the sargasso sea in the sky: Genesistrine, and is teleported or dropped by aliens to Earth. Crackpot lit 101: Charles Fort 
 This book is poor. It 's not "philosophical" in any sense because it's not logical and it's not supported by the majority of music scholars today. Reimer contradicts himself at every turn; he doesn't understand what Langer is really saying; and. his absolutist notion of music is completely out of synch with what most scholars argue about music today. Reimer just mouths a lot of fluffy, feel-good nonsense 
 Are we living in the end times is just what I expected.  Typical apologetic Christian scare tactics based on irrational fantasies. What should scare you is the nastiness of the previous "Christian" reviewers attitudes toward each other.  A person whom may be interested in the Christian worldview likely would be even more confused and probably put off by these people.  Why should they bother to read Mr. LaHaye's opinions or for that matter the Bible itself, since all these people have read these same books and come to such different interpretations  and conclusions.  If they're looking for love and comfort, why should they want to join a group of people that not only look forward to the world being destroyed and 80 percent of the nice people inhabiting it to be murdered and tortured forever, but also seem to hate people of their own faith?      Christians have such diverse opinions because the fact is that the Bible is hopelessly contradictory, no matter how hard apologists like LaHaye try to twist and destort its words to make it form to their own biases.  By all means, READ the New Testament.  Take your time, don't use study guides that try to tell you what they think it means, keep an open mind and THINK FOR YOURSELF. You will find that there is no question that the people writting the New Testament thought that the "end of the world" was going to happen in thier lifetimes.  Pay attention to Matt. 24 when Jesus says he will be back during that generation, or Matt. 16 where people standing there will not have drawn thier last breath before the second coming occurs.  You don't use terms like "the time is nigh", "the end of all things is at hand" or the first words of Revelations itself " the things which MUST SHORTLY come to pass" if you think it might take a couple of thousand years.  When the Bible says the world is flat, the sky is a solid dome supported by pillars with windows in it for the rain, space is full of water, and that giant human/angels used to inhabit the earth, it is wrong.  When it says that invisible people who live in the sky are going to come and destroy the earth and just about everybody in it, that again is wrong. More importantly, it is not moral or anything close to love, which the religious are always claiming they have so much of.       Don't wait for someone to come do some magic and make all your problems go away. Get off your knees and do it yourself. 
 Well, straight out I will admit that I am only half-way through this book, but already, I feel really bogged down, and slightly confused.    Ms. Myss seems to take a rather overly authoritative tone in this book, as she mixes Jungian psychology, Eastern religions and divination, all in an attempt to convince her readers that through her guidance they can come to know the destinies chosen for them before their birth, their "Sacred Contracts".  I feel that the author tends to over simplify the concepts of destiny, and pre-destination, as well as the nature of evil, and does so through a rather verbose, and strangely vague text.  I think that my eyes were really opened when I visited Ms. Myss' website and read the answers she had given to questions by her readers.  Her arrogant attitude and insistance that her way is the only way, left a sour taste in my mouth, I must say.  Many asked questions such as, "I can't narrow my personality down to only 8 archtypes, no matter how hard I try," and, "You insist that there are four archtypes that everyone has, no matter what.  I don't feel that I have all of these."  These questions were met with the insistance that there were only 8 archtypes, and that everyone has the four, no matter what.  Ms. Myss makes her "theory" sound like it is academically proven fact, which it is absolutely not.  I'm not sure that even Jung would agree to the way that his concepts of the archtype have been used in this book.  In summary, I am not sure that I will finish reading the book.  I want to, just to see if there is something that I am missing closer to the end, but from many of the reviews that I have read here, I'm not so sure it's worth it.  I suggest taking the book out from the library before you purchase it.  Some may like the authoritative tone, and complex theories of the book.  I did not 
 This book, albeit comical at times, was a total waste of my time and money, not a very good read, pretty much all the same jokes you hear as you are preparing to be wed, yada, yada, yada. Save your cash for the expensive reception dinner 
 As a white Boomer of 51, some of these songs were very familiar to me.  But most of the artists were 'one hit wonders.'  This is why I ordered the compliation.  The one song I really liked was "Kung Fu Fighting."  Remarkable that the lyrics in "Shaft" were so very limited.  The movie was much better.  
 13 Stories, 13 Epitaphs is the second book by William Vollmann that I've read and I still am not quite sure what to make of him. The first was Butterfly Stories, a sordid tale of a journalist and photographer in Thailand chasing hookers, looking for the one with a heart of gold. 13 Stories is somewhat similar with several people who are homeless, jobless, and addicted drugs, as well as several whores. It's hard to judge his writing without considering the content he writes about, which is usually derelicts and people on the fringes of society. It makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable, I can't relate with the characters and don't find much redeeming about his stories, it doesn't seems like he has an overall plan, it's not necessarily a morality tale.  I think I've had enough of his novels 
 Well, with 2001's "Planet of the Apes," we have yet another totally unneccesary remake.  No, not reimagining, a remake.    Just another jumbled mess of a remake.  There's Mark Wahlberg stepping into the Heston role of the original film.  The film opens with Wahlberg in orbit somewhere, then he very quickly crash lands on the ape planet.  But if you want to go to the kitchen at this point to get something to eat, pause the DVD, because if you don't, you might miss Mark getting captured, taken to the ape city, and thrown in with the other human captives, who are all intelligent and capable of speech.  So there's no explanation as to why the humans didn't formulate plans to put up a formidable resistance to the apes, years ago.  In the original film, the humans were like animals, so there was the explanation in the original film.  The remake offers no explanation.  But it took Mark to rally the human masses in this film, and they eventually escaped and revolted, in some jumbled mess of a climax to the movie.  The whole movie is just a jumbled mess, complete with two-dimensional (two might be a little too generous) characters we don't feel for, or care about -- including Wahlberg's character.  And forget any character development, or any mysterious trek across a 'forbidden zone.'  Everything in Burton's remake happens in a flash, so fast, that you never even grasp what just happened while you're watching, and you really don't care that much about what just happened, because it probably wasn't much anyway.  The "Planet of the Apes" franchise was not Tim Burton's intellectual property, so if it was his idea to make this remake, I'm guessing he had to get permission from the current copyright holder.  But my point here is a question: Does anybody in the entertainment industry ever say "no" to anybody else IN the industry anymore?  Did the copyright holder read the script of this remake before he gave it the greenlight?  All I'm saying is that I just don't get why the copyright holders, or the original creators of the franchise, just sit back and give these outside directors a blank check to do whatever they like, and let the franchise be brought down by these terrible remakes.  You would think that Heston wouldn't even want to appear in this, but he did.  Come on, the industry can't be this hard up for money.  I just don't get it 
 You would think that this book would have more to say concerning the sport of cycling. Instead it focuses more on womanizing and just how bad a man can be. That isn't to say there ins't some discussion of cycling, but what little there is is poor at best, outdated, and boring. Anyone truly into the sport of cycling will wish they had spent the time on their bike instead of reading this book. The end of the book will leave you shaking your head and saying - "well there goes x hours of my life I can't get back 
 I love plenty of Contemporary Country music... everything from "New Bluegrass" (Alison Krauss & Union Station) to "New Country" like Reba McEntire, Rascal Flatts, Brad Paisley, Martina... even a lot of Faith & Shania.  But I think this CD is crap.  The single star is for the only good song on the album, "Heads Carolina, Tails California" -- but really, 1 star for one good song out of ten is a bit too generous.  I'm astounded at how bad the other 9 songs are... elementary-school rhyming, uninspired melody lines, stupid lyrics, below-average accompaniment, etc.  One of the most annoying things to me is her habit of overpronnouncing every word in a song... I'd guess someone told her at some point that she slurs her words, and she was trying to overcompensate.  The result should be titled "Hooked on Phonics, starring JoDee Messina."  Listen to the preview of "On a Wing and a Prayer" for a good example of what I'm talking about.  I thank my lucky stars I borrowed this cotton candy from the library, rather than shelling out $16 for one song.  Do yourself a favor and buy "Heads Carolina, Tails California" online if you must have it 
 This book is full of assumptions and generalizations. Some information is distorted. According to the logic of the writer over 90% of the population should be already dead from "addiction". The writer assumes from the very beggining that any system that is centered around men is addictive and therefore harmful. It is possible, but the writer doesn't make any notes about the  men and women centered systems. The only system that is good is the female system 
 I'm an (unemployed) agronomist, here in Brazil.I tried to read this bad book, available free on internet.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it. All bad things who are possible to exist in a book, this book has.This book is racist.This book, tries to cover this, but this book is so or more racist, then a KKK's book.If you try to read it, you will ever see that the "menaces" are EVER non arians:africans, asiatics, etc.This book claims that "Africa is overpopulated".In fact any african countries has even the half, of the population per square mile, as Belgium to exemple. This book has hundreds of bogus and false theories. This book has a lot of doomed and false prophecies, about future.All of then, a complete failure.To exemple, this book "predicts" that "hundreds of millions" of peoples will be exterminated by famine between 1970 and 1980.A fraud. (...)In fact, eugenics = neomalthusianism = ecology.In fact eugenics, neo-malthusianism, marxism (leninism, stalinism, hitlerism, fascism, maoism, etc.) , are all godless religions. The only good thing in Paul R. Ehrlich, is that he was born in USA.(... 
 Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, "The Descent"  "The Descent" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.  At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.  Even though "The Descent" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.  "The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and language 
 I was hoping for a book with practical thoughts and techniques to help the reader navigate through the darker parts of life.  Instead this is a rambling essay that quotes pagan God's and assumes a level of knowledge that leaves the average reader wondering what the heck he is talking about.  I got tired of hearing about how we should embrace our dark side; and found the opinions that it's okay to invoke total lack of responsibilty for one's actions in pursuit of this darkness downright dangerous; (especially the chapter discussing women who wake up one day and no longer want to parent their children). It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters.  His book is obviously meant to appeal to a very particular audience and is not for someone who wants to get out of a depression and longs to live in the light.  It's not at all what I expected from the book jacket and knowing that he is a former Catholic Monk!  I also found his writing style difficult to follow and more in the mode of a scholarly paper than a book meant to convey knowledge to a wide range of readers.  Only for those already into the occult and previously inoculated to this genre 
 I am a big fan of Cassandra Wilson and was duped into buying this disc after reading reviews here and elsewhere. I knew after the first 3 songs that trouble was brewing as they all sounded alike. Indeed, the entire thing suffers from the same muddy mix and monotone vocals. What a waste. No diversity in song selection and no vocal range. She should lose T-Bone Burnett for her next effort. *Note* She has displayed this same poor judgment in concert with her song list 
 My son got this as a gift for his birthday. The parents that bought it didn't realize the action figures were not included. I have been to most of the area Bix Box retail places and no one sells them. VERY USELESS toy without the figurines. I am taking one more day to look for them, and if no luck, it will be boxed up and returned.  This is probably one of the worst marketing schemes I have seen where toys are concerned. How crappy to sell a dueling playset with no people to duel with. Very very stupid in my opinion. 
 The summer of 1999, aged 15, was the day I felt my innocence shattered. I had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a Star Wars I could call my own (as in made in my generation) only to find out that it was a piece of garbage full of bad/flat, lifeless acting, a story full of plotholes and inconsistencies with the original trilogy and enough CGI to make your eyes bleed.  The actors, including heavy weights like Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson, up and comers Natalie Portman, and gradually progressing into leading man status Ewan McGregor, are all wasted here. Neeson, McGregor and Jackson are OK but OK is all they are, but they don't stand out at all, nor does Portman. All I can say of Jake Lloyd is that he looks like he's having fun. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, ARGH. What was Lucas thinking? And poor Darth Maul got killed before we had a chance to get to know him.  But what's most offensive of all, aside from the lifeless/passionless acting, are the continuity errors. All these years we were led to believe that Obi-Wan (McGregor) risked a lot to make Anakin a Jedi Knight, but here Obi-Wan's little more than a 2nd banana lurking in the background, while Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) is at the front line doing what he can to get Anakin ahead, and it's just wrong. That was what hurt me the most, the fact that the film wasn't about Obi-Wan, that it didn't adhere to previous Star Wars history.  And Episode 2, alas, isn't that big of an improvement 
 This book is a waste of money for whomever buys it, a waste of paper, totally useless and offers absolutely no useful info beyond what any reasonable person does not know. The writer merely lives on a parked boat and might as well live in a cramped apartment from where he can write the same worthless stuff. There are no "essentials" in the book. Believe me, go spend your money somewhere else! Dutch West 
 I haven't read a Picoult book in a while because her formula was bothering me but I saw this in the airport and decided it would be a easy yet entertaining read for the tedious 3 hour journey.  It was entertaining to the extent that I finished it. Unfortunately - it was still formulaic and completely predictable.  Elements that I liked:   - Rape is very rarely easy to sort out and date rape cases involving drugs, ex-boyfriends and alcohol are especially difficult. The confusion and obfuscation that Picoult writes (whether that was her intention or just poor writing) surrounding the issue can be representative of an actual rape.    - Teenagers are notoriously melodramatic and self pitying and Trixie, though a little over the top, seemed like a typical teenager... the reaction of other students at her school to the rape and Trixie also seem plausible.   - I liked the graphic novel. The melodramatic aspects are typical of the genre and it was a great way to try and illustrate Daniel. The hidden word bit - hokey.   - I liked learning about the native cultures in Alaska. I would like to read a whole book that takes place there and explores the themes though maybe not by Picoult.   - I liked the idiot's guide to Dante that was incorporated into the book.  Things I didn't like:   - Picoult tries to incorporate too much into this book and thus wasn't able to fully develop it all. Though I liked the native Alaskan bit, it was too jumbled and it didn't really add to the plot. Like another reviewer I wasn't left with the impression that Daniel's haunted past resurfaced. I was expecting a lot more. Murder? That's too much to add to this already overburdened plot.   We lose threads here and there like Daniel's career and the wife's affair - he just disappears after his admission. Cutting is a very real phenomena for many young women and Jodi doesn't explain or develop it.  I don't know that it was at all believable. Could the myopic Trixie have had the wherewithal to make it to Alaska when she could barely see beyond her own break-up and tried to commit suicide multiple times?  The cop, the DNA analyst, the lawyers, the parents, the twist - I've seen them all before in Jodi's other books... it's part of her formula.  I wonder what would happen if Jodi spent maybe three or four years researching a novel and devoting time to its plot. She could excel in character development and careful analysis of difficult topics. I feel like this novel writing machine is doing herself, her readers and literature a disservice 
 The style is tiring and dull.Too much written by one scholar.Better to write less but write interestingly 
 There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  "If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction."  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw. If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!   
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 I had the same problem as everyone else -- after less than a month this blanket is useless because of the malfunctioning controller.  No way to fix and unable to return to Amazon because it was ordered longer than 30 days ago (Xmas gift for one of my roommates).    What an incredible waste of money - the first time in 10 yrs I have been disappointed with Amazon service (or lack thereof) 
 Like so many others before me, I too thought this would be the best humidifier - and it was! For about one week. To boot, this is my second one. The first one had the exact same problem - it ran perfectly for a week and then stopped producing any mist. I tried all the troubleshooting tips in the extremely detailed and helpful "manual". I assumed I had broken the very sensitive oscilator and that it was my fault, so like a fool, I purchased a second. HA! Same problem. It took a lot of self control on my part to restrain myself from picking the thing up and throwing it across the room - especially when you have a toddler who has chronic bronchial infections and you just want the darn thing to work. Here is my advice for anyone who has a broken one like me and has missed their window of opportunity to return it because they thought they could fix it: Step one - open trash can. Step two - hurl VENTASonic into it. Step three - slam lid on can 
 The best of "Prime Time" in my opinion is in the absoulutely fantastic chapter called "A Year-Round Vacation," which brilliantly and entertainingly documents the life and accomplishments of Del Webb, the founder of the Sun Cities.  The chapter brings to life the atmosphere of the late '50's relative to retirement, and traces the marketing concept that brings the "golden age" into reality for those who move to Sun City and others that follow.  But it is as if the book drops off a cliff after that chapter, with the rest of it being an unconvincing, detail-laden, name-dropping, dull read that makes you wonder where all the fun went.  Obviously, the author comes into the effort with heavy social-engineering baggage.  His thesis appears to be that in your old age pouring one's heart and sole back into humanity, especially the youth, is infinitely better that chasing pleasurable pursuits as a full-time endeavor.  I'm not convinced, and I don't like it when the author in proclaiming his thesis uses the pronoun "we" so forcefully.  For example, "We must embark on a major marketing effort communicating that the aging of America is a great opportunity for individuals and society, a massive call to action that replaces the long-standing message that older adults are superfuluous."  Can't you just see the active adults on their way to a concert, playing golf or tennis, or otherwise enjoying their day suddenly looking over and saying, "What's with the 'we' stuff, buddy?  Do we get a vote, or are you making all the decisions for us?"  Without the chapter on Del Webb, the book is a good read only for those whose vision is to save the world through the retired and elderly, with lots of money flowing into fat goverment-sponsored programs to make it "work."  Freedman appears to be one of the new breed of prophets who are more than willing to give visionary direction to those nearing or in retirement, whether they want it or not.  It's as if the graying of America is the new parade in town, and what could be better than to get in front of it before anyone else does?  With all that senseless fun they are having, surely they will want to follow the new leader into the more meaningful direction of dedicated public service 
 I thought this CD was rather dull compared to his earlier work. I'm normally a fan of Connick, but sometimes the originals need to say original 
 I'm not Catholic, but I was interested in learning about any evidence disproves the theories set forth in The DaVinci Code,so that I would understand their opposition to the book.   I thought this book would give me an objective view of the historic facts that The Davinci Code was based on, instead, it denied the theories using mostly beliefs as their supporting evidence.    I was disappointed because I had a hard time learning, from an academic perspective, why the Catholic church might have been falsely represented in this book 
 This movie has a record in my book: THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!  It starts out laughably funny, and goes on to be such a horrid excuse for "filmmaking" that I wished it over.  Being a fan of the Bard, with Macbeth being one of my favorite plays, I looked forward to seeing an adaptation from the Famous (or infamous if you like) Roman Polanski.  What I saw was a hack job by someone who thinks he has talent.  And I'm trying to be nice.   the worst parts of the movie consisted of the monologues, which consisted of Macbeth and others make pensive faces while their voices were heard, like they're trying to remember what they had for dinner, and of course, the disgusting nudity of the witches.  I don't need to see that.  It seems to Mr. Polanski that naked equals insanity, because once Lady M finally goes bananas, she leaves her clothes in her room.  Or perhaps the nudity was necessary in order to get Playboy Pictures to endorse the waste of film this movie was, with some nude women closer to Hugh Hefner's own age.    The one thing I can say about it is that I met my now wife while watching it, and we both hated it so much we became friends. 
 I have used this book over the last 9-12 months to study for my part I ANZCA exam.  It is frustrating to use at times, often containing contradictory or imprecise statements.  It definately contains several errors (including but not limited to the structures of sevoflurane and etidocaine).  It is now becomming rather out of date (examiners often expect more up to date information than this).  The chapters and sections themselves are well organised, but within paragraphs organisation is often a bit lacking.  Also, the physiology section is not particularly usefull, being too brief to be worthwhile in studying for exams.  Unfortunately I do not know of any other book dedicated to anaesthetic pharmacology that covers the topics in the appropriate amount of detail without being too massive to be managable.  So we will still be forced to use it for now.  Let's hope a new edition comes out soon that is much improved! 
 This is one of the worst horror movie I ever saw. I just hate it.    People dont waste your money renting or buying this crap.  If you want to see it that badly, just watch it on TV, like I did 
 The best thing I can say about the test is it took 13 days to receive my results.  The actual results varied greatly from those I received from my doctor 3 months prior:  (...)  Both tests were taken following a 12-hour fast.  All instructions were followed.  I find it hard to believe my cholesterol levels changed so drastically in 3 months.  I contacted BioSafe customer service.   All representatives were busy on my first call so I left a message, which was not returned.  I called again and was able to speak to someone right away.  The customer service person was very pleasant and took a lot of time explaining how accurate their tests were and how results from different testing methods (finger prick vs. blood drawn from arm) will vary "slightly".   (...)  I question the accuracy of the biosafe results.      
 this is just ok I have listened to all the idols and I go way back to connie francis these people are just ok I heard a singer yesterday that really struck a note in my heart katharine mcphee thats more like it: 
 It is very disappointing to have 40 pages of paper and only be able to print a little over half that number with the cartridge that comes with it. I now have three unopened packages of paper that I have no cartridge for. I think we should be able to buy just the cartridge when we need to. It sure would be nice. That is why I am only rating one star. Otherwise, it would have been a five....  Thanks, Marsh 
 I would not go so far as to say this movie is terrible. I would say it is self-important, immature, obvious, and overwhelmingly one-sided.  It seems Spike Lee does not believe there are any white people alive who are not either stupid, racist, phony, or downright evil.  I had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with 4 1/2 minutes of a sleazy looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music. Then 4 minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words.  Lee had his moments, but it was pretty much a 2-hour music video. Spike Lee doesn't mess with fantasy, only with reality and his reality is black and white. It is infact fantasy, and pure propaganda 
 I've read several Bentley Little books although why, i'm not sure.  I can't say for sure if this one or the one about the postman was worse, but either way, i have given up reading anything he writes.  If i could rate this book with less than one star, i would.  I picture the first seventy-five percent of this book written at his leisure, with very little interest other than for the money he would make when it got published.  The last twenty-five percent of the book, the finale, seemed rushed and contrived, written in a flash because his dead line was quickly approaching.  If a writer is going to write, he should have the decency to at least try his best.  And if a publisher is going to publish, he should have enough respect not to insult readers with this kind of garbage 
 A child wants to tell his father he loves him, and the father turns the exchange into a cruel game of one-upmanship.  The child tries and tries until he collapses, exhausted - and still the father won't accept the heartfelt message and chooses to outdo his tiny child and have the last word. That this book is popular and well received is disturbing to me.  The illustrations are very nice - and I'm hoping that this is the attraction people feel, since the message borders on psychological abuse 
 Of all the books on Privacy I've seen, this one is about the most useless.  Some of the information is just plain wrong.    There is little or nothing offered in this book that could be of value to anyone 
 This book is OK as a VERY basic introduction to Icelandic. You learn the word for "coach" (ruta) before yes and no. Also, the exercises are short and insignificant. When you learn about declensions (probably the most important aspect of Icelandic grammar), all the book has is a long paragraph, a HUGE graph (with vauge footnotes "There is a subgroup of masculine nouns which has -ir instead of -ar in the nominitive plural and -i in the accusative plural". No hint of these words), and one, measly fill in the blank activity.  This is good if you want to become vaugely acquainted witht the language, or if you just want to learn a few phrases. For the serious Icelandic student, get the Teach Yourself book 
 This is not really a practical toy. My son gets discouraged, because you have to press on the keys really hard and in order to follow the music you have to be rough. It's like playing musical chairs with 5 bullies and a moving floor 
 I WAS GREATLY DISHEARTENED, NOT REALIZING THE NATURE OF THIS BOOK PRIOR TO PURCHASE.I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED IT IF I WAS ABLE TO PREVIEW IT FIRST.  I HAVE ENJOYED HIS HISTORICAL FICTIONS VERY MUCH!!(THE OTHER DAN BROWN) I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS FIRST BUT TRUSTED AMAZON WHEN THEY HAD IT COMBINED WITH DIGITAL FORTRESS!! 
 The buyer made the purchase so complex! I am very anger about that 
 He wrote a long essay about it, and condemned it for being an "unmoral" (as opposed to "immoral") book.  If he used the adjective "brilliant," it was probably in a negative way.  Believe me, he was no fan of the author or of this particular book 
 Beware! On off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged. The place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it's been about 2 weeks. :- 
 Unfunny other than the title, myopic,meandering and unfocused, visceral hate attempting to pass as humor. My own personal opinion after reading this book, and then watching Bill O'Reilly's program? Sweet Jesus, he is fair and balanced - no wonder the extreme wing of my Democratic party doesn't like him. He offers both sides of the story, and sometimes a third! What this book did was lead me to the realization and conclusion that the "lame stream" media is unfair, and unbalanced. I tried to give my used copy of this book to my local library and they refused the donation - "We don't condone hate" 
 Lou Reed rocks!!! Dude!! But methinks this collection dost not. The tunes are all good, but there aren't very many of them, and the sound is deplorable, in that inimitable RCA-first-CD-edition sort of way (fans of the Jefferson Airplane and Harry Nilsson know what I'm talking about). A much better jumping off point would be "Different Times: Lou Reed in the 70's", or, even better, check out "Transformer" or "Rock 'n' Roll Animal" 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 I have not finished this book yet but so far I think this woman is a nut. Referring to grocery store shelves as morgues for "dead" food. That's just stupid and weird. No cooked food? None? Forget it, lady. She has some good ideas but they are taken to the extreme 
 I usually like Tami Hoag's books, she is a story teller with a surprising twist. The twist was there this time also. However,the characters were way too predictable. They all seemed on the dark side, even the "heroes." Surely there has got to be a non-divorced person in this world. Not in her book. Well, unless you are the guy who kills people because they're in the way. Then you can be single and never married.  The bad guys had no redemptive features -- too cartoon-like.   And the unnecessarily bad language was a turn-off. Surely even in cop land not every one uses the f... word in every sentence.  The plot was somewhat interesting but felt undeveloped, kind of like the characters.  Of course tastes differ. I like a bit more psychological depth with my murders than Tami Hoag offers in this story. Maybe next time 
 I purchased this book in hopes of getting the most out of my Bowflex Extreme 2. Other reviewers seemed to really like this book, so maybe I'm way off in my expectations. I've been working out for quite a while and recently purchased a Bowflex in hopes of saving time & money by working out at home instead of the gym. I'm not so sure about that decision now... The author uses this book to tell long background stories about back when he worked here or there. It seems to be long winded information that could be summed up without all the page fill & fluff. The diet plan is a no-brainer - it is such a calorie restricted diet anyone will lose weight on it, with or without the Bowflex. 1200 - 1000 calories a day for women will work no matter what. The before and after photos depict weight loss, but I didn't notice anyone making any kind of muscle gains. He makes the Bowflex sound like a magic wand and it's not. To gain muscle you have to work, and his proposed workouts are laughable. I get more exercise grocery shopping than his "workouts". The exercises demonstrated are fine if you have that particular model of Bowflex, but the book is outdated and not helpful if you own an Extreme or Ultimate. I say save your money unless you've never exercised before in your life and have absolutely no idea how exercise & your body work 
 Save your money or give it to charity. This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent. The direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory. I was so bored with this film that I can't even bring myself to write anything else about it 
 I subscribed to Hobby Farm and after reading two issues I cancelled it.   I read an article in the March/April issue about show birds. Then, I got my May/June issue. Don Schrider, the Communication Director of ALBC, wrote in to correct the story. The article claimed "over 1000" birds at the show, the correction was 11,640 birds were present. The other correction was regarding earlobe color and egg shell color stating there are exceptions to the red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs.    In the Mar/Apr issue I read an article about Guinea hens. In the May/June issue I read another letter from a reader (Dana Manchester a member of the Guinea Fowl Breeders Assoc.) correcting the article in the previous issue. Apparently, Guineas aren't the "watch fowl" they are portrayed to be, but fall victim to predation often. Dana Manchester also corrected the mislabeled photos of Guineas.    These may be small errors but how goods is a resource that isn't reliable?   If errors were the only issues, I may have given the mag 3 stars but the article on manure management in the May/June issue was lacking on many levels. The advise in a nutshell was buy a manure spreader that you can pull around your field, fill'er up and drive. One word of caution according to the article- only use well rotted manure in the garden, but there wasn't one word on how to rot manure.    I liked the article about smaller breeds of cattle, "Bigger is Not Better" May/June but we'll have to wait for the next issue to see if any readers step forward with corrections.   I am not waiting around.   There are a lot books and magazines dedicated to small farms. I like Mother Nature News and I just subscribed to Countryside (my nephew recommended it he owns a small farm, as well). I also like John Seymour's book Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It. He has an upbeat attitude with a can-do spirit. 
 This book is a mess.  The thesis presented in the introduction is a rambling essay on the importance of followers and historical forces in leadership, which might leave the reader less informed about leadership  than before he/she read it.  What's worse is that the intro has nothing at  all to do with the rest of the book (which is marginal in it's own right).   The case studies are way too short and are made even less informative by  Wills habit of not even mentioning the leader until five or six pages of  nonsense. My overall feeling of this book is that it was poorly researched  and badly written.  I wonder (in all seriousness) whether Wills knows  anything at all about some of the people he writes about.  Skip this one. I  suggest Lincoln on Leadership instead: it provides the rudiments of  leadership with clear, well researched examples 
 Being interested in current events, I was chagrinned to find that this book is almost exclusively a historical review beginning at the start of the Cold War and crawling up to our present day. Having lived through most of this history, I found it not that enlightening, albeit somewhat useful, as it always is to review things long put aside. I found the book boring to read, not compelling like a lot of good historical writing often is, David McCullough's work as an example.  Given the Democratic gains from Rham Emanuel's handpicked candidates for the House, Beinart's views seem coincident with the arrival of some of these new representatives, so it will be interesting to see if he's accurately intuited the zeitgeist of the resuscitated Democratic Party, and how effectively it manages to reorient US foreign policy 
 This foil cutter requires more effort (a stronger squeeze) than it really ought to, and too much turning.  The built-in foil cutter on my "Boomerang" brand waiter's corkscrew works more reliably, and requires less effort, and the whole corkscrew hardly costs more than this foil cutter.  I had expected that a purpose-built, standalone foil cutter would excel at the task, but this device came up short 
 it is pretty general,there is no such thing as advice or anything the like about practices.he insists in almost every chapter that the mission is the most important thing.the only intersting ideas in his book are some about leadership, but i felt very much that i already knew them,he only confirmed them.this is not to say i am a genius.i am 18, so i guess if you are involved in running a nonprofit for more than one year, you would be able to write a better book.  for a beginner it might be intersting to get it from the library, and read it in a train or so.  not bad, but getting a book on leadership,and other one  on marketing is a much better idea 
 I bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me. I bought this to try to reduce the risk of SIDS since his has been sleeping in my bed. Unfortunately, he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper. Once his legs went off the side, his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper. Of course this concerned me so each time I woke up, I had to move him again. Finally, after a couple of time of doing this, I just took him out of it. This is the second sleep positioner I have bought and both have been worthless!!! 
 It may be good for a university classroom, but I don't think this book works well on its own.  It lacks the details that would really make clear the significance of the people and events and leave them in the memory.  I was even bored by the section on the Cultural Revolution!  But I did learn a fair bit nonetheless 
 The images and text will make for nightmares. Not a fun one like "Where the wild things are." He is talented, just missed the mark on this one 
 Two cents from a rank amateur/beginning programmer. At the moment, I'm on page 179 of this book and the main problem I have so far is with the way the information is communicated. Personally, I now know that I should have picked up a book that taught VB concepts via small projects and tasks. A "in chapter 1 we'll build a simple tool to get familiar w/ the IDE. In chapter 2 we'll improve our skillset by building a slightly advanced tool to learn about declaring variables, etc." approach would work better for me. Unfortunately, this book doesn't  really do that. The concepts here are explained mostly with bits of standalone code. Hopefully, perhaps by page 200, we'll commence with some "learning by doing." Yes, hopefully. In the meantime, I'll grit my teeth and continue with the book, but right now it simply isn't working for me 
 When the End of History appeared, one did not know exactly what to think of it, nowadays we know who Fukuyama is: the US Republican party ideologue. While the end of history tried to prove the US Republican ideology as the philosophical nec plus ultra, the goal of history, in an Hegelian way, the great disruption tries to prove it as a biological-sociological necessity, to be human is to be a Republican.  Although it is a flawed book, it makes interesting reading to discern fact and fiction in this book, the places where the conclusions and facts just disconnect, it is like unravelling the Da Vinci code. The danger of the book is the indiscriminate use of academic bits and pieces, it gives a veneer of credibility to the whole were it is not always warranted.   The basic premise of the book, namely the importance of social capital and the decline thereof since the mid 60's, is something I take as credible, although even Fukuyama admits he cannot really prove it very well. From the dip in social capital, Fukuyama delves into the fundamentals of human nature to prove that we are moral and will ultimately reconstitute some moral order along conservative party lines, the invisible hand of morality will cause an upward cycle after every downward cycle, hardly a convincing story line.  What is, however funny about the book is that the academic material presented can just as easily be construed to disprove the republican dogmas. E.g. accepting the importance of social capital in healthy economies makes mince-meat of the Bush-bubble economic policy of indiscriminate deficit spending. I do think social capital deserves its own capital letter in the Cobb-Douglass function, it would probably de-emphasize the worship of productivity a little bit in economic thought and make economic theory a bit more relevant to the economy.  Other blind spots for Fukuyama include the role of inequality in the break-down of social capital (e;g; in the false statement that it is pride, not injustice, why test persons reject unequal outcomes in 2-player distribution games). Another blind spot for Fukuyama is that he sees only a causal relation one-way between the loss of social capital and demographic decline, not the other way around, from demographic decline to loss of social capital.  Fukuyama writes with ideological blinders but still puts the main social problem of the 90's and early 21st century on the table, that is why I grant a 2 star to the book.     
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 First, this looks to be an excellent book -- if -- you eat eggs and dairy.  If you follow a plant based diet, this is not the book for you.  There are handful - count maybe 5 - recipes that don't have eggs and dairy.  It is possible to substitute Earth Balance for butter and tinker with egg replacers for the eggs, if you want to bother.  For some reason I thought that because it has Buddhist roots it would lean more heavily on plant-based baking.  
 This read like a college textbook, giving lots of factual information, but presenting it in a dry, mind numbing way. If all you want is the facts, then it's fine, but if you want an exciting read based on an exciting subject then I  wouldn't recommend it. 
 ok i've listened to this album quite a few times and still have yet to find a strong point. i didn't get his first album so i'm not comparing like some reviewers may. "on again tonight" is the reason i   bought this album and it's one of the only songs i like on it. some people who really like this cd will say "don't listen to him". or something like that but i'm right. a few of these songs aren't very well written and just trail off. as far as his voice goes, even if he has range, his voice isn't very good. i mean i like his voice on "beer man" and "on again to night" but some of these songs his voice makes sound worse. although some songs are ok none are exactly good. if you don't have the new toby keith, little big town, gary allan, jason aldean, jamey johnson, or brad paisley album(to name a few) get one of those cause ALL of them are much better than this.  don't waste your money on it...i di 
 I am Catholic and have started to do Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. I thought this book would be a great boost to my practice. I have never in my life read such a depressing and violent book. If this woman were alive today she would be in a Psychiatric ward for her own safety. The self imposed torture she created for herself made me want to cry. I do not think Jesus Christ would ever condone this type self-debasing in his name. I believe in a Jesus of loving kindness and compassion. You certainly do not have to beat, starve, and drink fowl water to get his attention or to cleanse yourself of impurities. The book will go on the shelf never to be read again. I can see why some people leave the Christian faith if books like this come to their attention     
 A very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a "New York Times Best Seller List" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation.  This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson "Shot heard around the world" homerun. If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial. You come away thinking "I really don't care bout this stuff" - I don't care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover's bathroom habits, Klara Sax's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don't have much depth to really care about. At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.  I read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50's (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business.   The "masterful" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo's ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult.   Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80's were just years of fear, and the 90's are years of greed? I am still unsure, I still don't think any of these themes came across well.  Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort. You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the "The Corrections" by Franzen or "The Cold Six Thousand" by Ellroy  which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end.  Read the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.  
 The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end 
 We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...  Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the  see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry. 
 Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted! 
 Nietzsche, who started all this, may or may not have been the deepest thinker since Socrates, but he was a stylistic virtuoso. Deleuze and Guattari, on the other hand, were founder members of a postmodern cult whose watchword is: obscurity = profundity. But while some profound things may be ineluctably obscure, by no means all obscure things are profound.  This book, which runs to 250 pages scarcely burdened by a coherently expressed thought, is in line for the prestigious prize, the Golden Merde de Taureau. It contains, along with much else, the authors' mature lucubrations on the foundations of calculus, which have greatly impressed readers who flunked high-school math. Others maintain that these passages are not about mathematics at all, just as the passages about science are not about science, and they may be right. What, if anything, it is about is anyone's guess, and many have speculated, some to their own satisfaction. One thing we can be sure of, because the authors tell us: they are creating concepts. This important work should not be undertaken by those in whom unfortunate defects of education have left a residual respect for language and joined-up thought.  The book was a bestseller in France - possibly the most unread bestseller since a 'A Brief History of Time', but for different reasons 
 Succinctly put, this is probably the worst science fiction book I've read, and I've read a lot of them. I'll go point by point:  1: The idea. Some may call this novel "innovative," but that is most certainly a misuse of the word. The main idea of this book is that "incest" as we now use this word is ok as long as it either 1) genetically harmless; 2) failing the first condition, does not produce babies. Incest and other such "alternative family relationships," as another reviewer so mildly put it, is not a new idea at all. Now, I am not close minded to anything, but the sort of self-serving and constant glorification of what is ultimately a bad idea even biologically speaking that Heinlein subjects his readers too is boring, unimaginative, uninformative, and frankly morbid.  2: The plot. Nonexistent. There is no dynamic to the story. Heinlen meanders from one time-frame to another with no logic to tie them all up. There is an interesting story here and there, but they serve no meaningful purpose, except to, again, glorify (and not simply justify) "alternative family relationships."  3: The characters. I haven't found any. At least none that were really interesting. There is Lazarus, who is basically a sleazeball who is rules by his two cardinal instincts entirely: survival and reproduction. There are women, who are uniformely and without exception ruled by only one of those two instincts: reproduction. Others in the book are basically filler material.  4: The writing. Atrocious. Heinlein puts too much faith in dialogue. I say too much because he can't write it. All dialogues are protracted and artificial, they are never to a point, and they all sound alike. The last point bears repeating: you can almost never tell whose speech you are reading, except when 1) someone says they want Lazarus' baby (this happens often and it's a clue that a female character must be speaking) or 2) someone reminisces about the days of yore (that's a clue to Lazarus). But the style of the speech is the same for everyone.  5. The science fiction. Nonexistent. There are references to "rejuvenation," "time travel," and space colonization. But that's about as far as we get. There is absolutely no elaboration on how, for instance, a ten-fold increase in lifespan would have affected the reproductive choices of humanity. This is particulaly puzzling since all characters in the story are of such extraordinary verility. Put two and two together: if all women have babies every year or so, and all of those babies live for a thousand years each, how long will it take you to overpopulate a planet? The answer is: hardly any time at all. Yet Heinlein never pauses to explain how the economies of his worlds continue to function and never stops to elaborate on the causes of social collapses that do happen from time to time.   Last thing. Why did I spend all this time writing a review. Because I find it troubling that so many give this book 5-stars. This is not a worthwile read. If you are interested in romance novels, go to a different section: Heinlein is probably not the best in that genre. If you are interested in science fiction with well-developed ideas and good fiction, pick up Asimov, Greg Bear, Stephen Baxter (bad writing but great science), John C. Wright, Will McCarthy, or Vernor Vinge 
 Just got the order of the CD from Amazon. Both the cover of the case and the cover of the CD is right: Under a Shady Tree. However, when we listen to it, it is totally different songs from different language!!! What the hell can that happen?! I don't even know if we can return it: since it is opened! But it is totally wrong songs!!! Could somebody help me here? How to contact Amazon? Thank you!! 
 I expected this bag to be much more comfortable ... but I have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags. However, I do like all the compartments for organizing 
 Purported knowledge not IN style anymore by the socalled academic elites.  Evolution, in the boxing ring got a KO by Professional scientists who UNderstand that KO means down.  Who LIVES for evolution other than those who live IN illusion.  Some day there will be enough people on EArTh to expose the lies of this ridiculous theory.  Until Then, Lies they will tell, and Exceptional lies they will be 
 Gould's '55 recording of the Goldberg variations was a challenging statement from a very young man. Perhaps it needed to be played this way, at least once, or perhaps Gould needed to play it this way at that time.  He thought better of it and re-recorded the work in '82 and it is this last interpretation that will stand the test of time. It is an interpretation that is much closer to the accepted sound, but how beautiful it is! Bach doesn't need eccentric rhythms and tempi to gain attention and it turned out that neither did Gould. You can still hear his vocalise (love it or loathe it - I love it), but the passion, depth and strength of the later work overshadows his earlier effort and nearly everyone else's efforts too. Hear them both and then decide for yourself  RIchard Maycoc 
 I was pretty dissapointed with this book.  All the "inside information" has been pretty much common knowledge.  Although "taking sides" is pretty much a natural in doing Beatles books, the author seems particularly anti Paul/Linda.   It seemed to me the author's main interest wasn't even the Beatles, but Hare Krishna. I'd suggest "Magical Mystery Tours, My Life With the Beatles" by Tony Bramwell.  It was a much more detailed and enjoyable read 
 There is only one reason : Stephen Thornton has spoiled Marion's original masterpiece. If you can get the 2nd edition, which Thornton didn't join yet, just compare it with current one. Except this, I dare to say this book is the best intermediate classical mechanics text book. This was the bible of classical mechanics, but not any more. 
 The product is what I expected, and the price was good for the advertised quantity.  However, the packers at Amazon must have misunderstood the quantity description, or possibly the description was truncated.  I was supposed to receive a pack of 3 packages.  Each package has 2 cartridges.  The packers sent me only two packages in the shipping container.  Also, the packing slip did not include a customer service phone number 
 I read this book before I spent one horrible, frustrating year substitute teaching.  Not helpful; I believe this book assumes that everyone will teach in a school where kids are well-behaved most of the time and school administrations will acknowledge the subs whom they need desperately 
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 It is unfortunate this book didn't come out better. Some glaring problems with it include: - has no concept of energy physics to begin with - does not understand "hydrogen economy" (hydrogen's an expensive storage, not a source of energy) - downplays geological data of oil discovery (or doesn't understand it), although Hubbert is covered briefly - believes or disseminates half-baked unproven ideas from the research sector: scientifically not valid energy sources are brought forward as alternative fuels - does not deal with the net energy concept (EROEI) or even refer to it  With these fundamental oversights it's really difficult to recommend the book.  It's not completely without merit as it does tell some of the basics right, but mostly it's pathologically impartial journalistic fluff, without looking at the hard facts as a good researcher should.   It's too much about how we are miraculously going to replace oil, gas and coal with tar sands, nuclear power, hydrogen and live happily ever after.  To those readers who want to believe this, this might be a good book. People looking for valid and scientifically solid reasoning on the subject will be sorely disappointed.  I'd recommend books by Deffeyes, Simmons, Heinberg, Campbell and many others before this (all on peak oil) 
 I wish I had read some of the reviews of this book before making my purchase. I would have passed on it. I was hoping for something a little more detailed, more definitive. Instead I see a smattering of questionable entries on locations that were easily accessed on his itinerary, whether they were the best the state has to offer or not. As many would, I first looked at a state I know well (Kansas), to see Wood's recommendations. Gulp - he was way off! If P.J. Dinsmoore's "Garden of Eden" in Lucas is not even mentioned, or the world's largest ball of twine in Cawker City, this guy has not done his homework. 
 This is the worst book ever written!  It's obvious the author doesn't know what he is writing about.  Not only that, this book is poorly written and contains no real information.  The more you read, the more you wonder why you are reading.  Where is this book taking me?  What is the point of this book?  There is no point.  Absolutely no point at all.  It appears the author is merely trying to benefit from the fame of a dead Hollywood actress.  If Lucy only knew!  I spent three hours with this book and it saddens me that I'll never get those three hours back.  I also hope this book was printed on recylcled paper because it would be a real shame if a tree gave up its life for this.  Needless to say, I do not recommend this book to anyone. 
 I can't help but wonder if this film wasn't made more from an excuse to cash in on the popularity of John Goodman at the time of this film than an honest desire to portray the baseball icon.  It would certainly explain the film's inaccuracies and rushed feel.  I remember that around that time (late 80's, early 90s), Goodman seemed to be fairly popular.  Can it be coincidence that somebody wanted to make a film about Babe Ruth at around the same time Goodman started receiving recognition in Hollywood?  Honestly, I don't think so.  At any rate, Goodman is miscast as Ruth.  For one thing, Ruth wasn't really fat; more like broad and stocky.  He was quite athletic and able to play the field -  remember, there was no such thing as a designated hitter back then.  In other words, offense isn't the only part of baseball; Ruth played defense too.  Does this film ever show Ruth in the outfield?  Can't say for sure because I didn't really watch the entire thing, but it's hard to imagine paunchy John Goodman fielding fly balls.  The other thing is Goodman is simply unlikeable as Ruth.  As we can see from film footage (including Pride of the Yankees), the real Ruth was energetic and charismatic.  Goodman's Ruth is simply loud, crass and grating 
 Once upon a time Tami Hoag wrote romances.  This is a rather simplistic romance and not one of the mystery/suspense novels that she now writes.  She is better at the latter than the former 
 The author's constant reference to other mystery writers was extremely annoying.  I've read other books by this author, and don't recall this tactic.  I will probably not read any more of her books 
 I am sorry to have to say these things but I feel it necessary to be honest. I am a avid reader and I picked this book up to try this author. This book was very slow and the characters  are very shallow.I felt no attachment or pull to any of them. I kept waiting for something to happen but to my dissapointment it never came. You as a reader can tell from the first few chapters exactly what will take place in this book. There was nothing in this book of interest to me as a reader and I will think twice next time before reading anything from this author 
 I rented the film version of "A Home at the End of the World" shortly after catching the "The Hours" on cable. I was pretty impressed with both. My guess was that "The Hours" had the kind of budget and richness to capture the book, whereas "A Home..." was a small independent film that had more handicaps. I figured the book on which it was based would be a better introduction to Cunningham, because it had a better shot at being stronger than the film. Well, sometimes the film is better....  The film really centers on Bobby and Jonathan. The book includes all of the main characters as narrators and has an overlapping narrative structure. Because of this, the book fleshes out the female characters better and we see why Jonathan's mother was cast with Cissy Spacek rather than someone who seemed Midwestern and why Jonathan's father was so remote. Bobby's character has more sides, although the result is that he is less vivid than Colin Ferrell's portrayal. The three-dimensionality in the book is probably more realistic, but the film version of Bobby captures better that which is important--his odd mix of emotional distance, engagement, adaptability and ambiability. Beyond his sexual orientation, Jonathan doesn't emerge very strongly in either medium.  The book oddly does worse in setting the time and place than the film. I grew-up in the Cleveland of the 60s and 70s and made many trips to New York in the 80s. Neither place fares well in the book. Cleveland was in approaching its nadir--an unhip place beginning a long economic decline, yet also a place with vibrant music scene (that attracted many future "names" for their early tours), racial tension, and the residue of various European ethnic cultures and rivalries---in other words, it had atmosphere and it was a good launching pad to go someplace more "hip". The book protrays a generic place that is more like the inland, second or third string cities of the Midwest--places like Columbus or Fort Wayne that are big on Babbitry and bragging about their chain restaurants. New York also seems oddly unlike itself. The New York of the book's era was filled with menace--crime, fear of crime, grafitti-filled subways, filth, and a general sense of dysfunction, as well as the kind of energy, vitality, and avant garde spirit that have always drawn people to the City. The book could have taken place in the tiny bohemian quarter of Atlanta or some other provincial backwater, for all it matters. The gay world of the book's time also is lacking--it takes place at beginning of the age of AIDS and the end of libertine gay liberation. Yet, talk of AIDS is muted beyond the early denial of its presence and Jonathan has to be most sexless gay man in queer lit. Popular music plays a big role in the book, but Cunningham seems to have drawn a random selection from hits lists of the 70s, rather than combinations of music that fit in time or that would have appealed to a common audience. Although Cunningham grew-up in this era, he clearly participated rather little in the popular culture of it.  The story proceeds like the movie, with the addition of Erich, Jonathan's  bartender "boyfriend" (the relationship is undefined and mysterious to both of them). Toward the end of the book, Erich seems to be more of a plot device than a real person. The other characters take care of him as he convalesces, but with an odd lack of commitment.   Few films or books are made about menage a trois relationships and fewer films ask us to buy Collin Ferrell as a twentysomething virgin. Yet, the book came off as something far less than the film. The odd semi-sexual bond between Bobby and Jonathan was believable in the film but not in the book. Cissy Spacek took a truncated script and a thankless role in the film and communicated more about the mother's story than what we get in the book, despite the greater backstory. The film does better without Erich and without the coyness about Jonathan's HIV status. I wish I could have given the book as many stars as most of the other reviews, but by the time I finished, I just was glad that the story had ended 
 This has got to be the worst stand up comedian i have ever seen. The best part of his comedy was when he was "quiet" getting a drink or lighting a cig which was often (and yes im a smoker myself). Most of the jokes were boring and he made them worse by pausing and or talking very slow as if "HERES MY LAME PUNCHLINE"....bbblllaahhh...i forced a chuckle out twice for the minimal wit in this dvd. This was part of the  box set and if you would take some advice from me, i havent seen the rest of the dvd's in this set but we have an older Jeff Foxworthy vhs and it was very funny and i have the Bill Engvall cd and its funny and ive heard larry the cable guy is funny and im hoping so ...were watching them next..hope this help 
 The book tries to reinvent science by computer experiments on CA and to justify this by a shaky "principle of computational equivalence". It is way too much a stretch. There are various statements in the book which show that the author misunderstood what science is all about. An example is that the author mixed up the scientific methodology and the content of science with the method used to describe science. Among the various chapters where the author tried to account for the areas of science, the shakiest one is its account for quantum physics. I encourage the readers to read the chapter carefully to see for themselves. Anyway, after reading the book, I have to sadly say that the book does not have what it takes to support its claim. The author wasted too much of his time and the readers', too. Potential readers: don't waste your money on the book. If you need to read it to see how confused the author is, just check it out in the book store or from you local library if possible 
 What could have been an interesting plot - it sounds like a Tim Powers novel when described - wasted by horribly shallow, one-dimensional and utterly unsympathetic characters. I managed to drag myself through it, but the conclusion was ultimately unsatisfying, the turn-arounds in the characters unexplained an unbelievable. Don't bother 
 After reading this book I felt that I paid some good money for repetition, advertisement and teaching of how to get your company to send you to do some course work.  This is not what I was looking for 
 I hear all the time as i read hip hop mags and articles all about how great Wild Style IS THE BEST HIP HOP movie ever. Well I purchased it at the first of the year and guess  what it cant't hold Beat Street and Breakin or Krush Grooves jockstrap. I think the movie Rappin or even the not so get  Lorenzo Lamas Hip Hop movie Body Rock has moments that's even better than Wild Style. People who read this will  probably say what gives you the right to think you know so much well me being 30 years old you can do the math. Thats around when the Hip Hop movement started. So if your a movie collector. Go ahead and buy it but if you want a good movie to watch. Then purchase somthing else.  
 Pinkerton is my favorite album of all time, closely followed by their debut. If you want Weezer, those are your albums. It breaks my heart to see Weezer putting out this crap 
 I love DCD and have since the mid 80's.  Maybe I am missing the point of a tribute album, because this album, while okay, offers nothing new, musically or emotionally.  I was hoping that some talented artist world interpret the music and soul of these songs for themselves - and in turn share with us a new perspective and a new experience.  But instead all that is here are some simplistic renditions and uninviting covers.  What bothered me the most are the pieces where the tribute band did everything they could (vocals and instruments) to sound just like DCD.  My first comment would be... `not possible', and the second would be `Why' even if you could???  I can see the enjoyment from the musician's point of view of playing the music the same as DCD did, but not as the one who is listening!  The few songs where the artists took the music and made it their own were much more enjoyable for me, but there is just not enough of that here.  Mostly the music is just murky shadows of the real thing 
 Smith does very little to identify the entire story of social security. He fails to identify the ever increasing additions to the population that paid into the fund;(It originally included only blue colar workers, then as the fund got into financial trouble another category of workers were added to bolster the fund. The military was brought in in 1957 and federal workers in 1984 as the fund continued to get into financial trouble.)  He puts all the blame on Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and attempts to give credit to Clinton for trying to salvage the ponzi scheme. He fails to identify other fiscal impacts that impacted the national budget deficits.  Essentialy poorly researched and misleading 
 Don't waste your time with this, folks. This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film "Graffiti Bridge."   But if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet-shooting, then go for it 
 Cellulose Gel, Lactic Acid, Sucralose, Titanium Dioxide, Salt, Xanthan Gum, and Potassium Sorbate.....yum can't wait to get me some more titanium dioxide in me...how great does that sound! 
 I did not like this book. The organization was abysmal, and I decided to sell it back to the college bookstore for use by future hapless students, because it is not good as a reference guide.  I did not like how the author seemed to gear the book to an audience that is terrified of their computers or anything dealing with *gasp* math 
 Ordered the book, and it had not even shipped 2 months later.  When ordering a book, you expect to receive it within a decent amount of time.  This says it will ship in 4-6 weeks, but even that didn't happen.  Don't order this book, find one that will actually ship to you.  I ended up cancelling my order due to this rediculous wait time.  
 Other than the chapter on the Driods, this book is not worth your time.  Better to read Kip Thorne.  How the author could have taken such interesting subjects and made them some uninteresting is somewhat amazing.   Don't read this 
 A biography about a boy - and a very tough and brave one - who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors (or killed and maimed) of Iwo experienced. He saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice. By strict definition, this act was deserving of the Medal of Honor. His terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching, but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of Iwo veterans, or any other battle, I have read. The other accounts I have read generally conclude: War is a horrible thing to experience, and not glorious, but "I would do it again.........". The recent books I have read will illustrate this contrast: "GOODBYE, DARKNESS", William Manchester "GOD IS NOT HERE.....", Richard Overton "THE QUIET HERO", Gary W. Toyn "FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS", James Bradley "THE LAST LIEUTENANT", John Shively These men may have entered combat as boys, but they certainly left as men.  
 Seemed like a good start, however pages 25 - 57 were missing and I had to return it, Am waiting for you to send it to me and I will be happy to review it the 
 This book is for people who do not have a wedding budget and who can afford a $100,000.00 wedding.  This book is so dry and boring talking about etiquete it puts you to sleep.  It makes planning a wedding seem like  planning a funeral.  No fun at all 
 I was really looking forward to reading this novel -- I loved the English Patient (the movie), I had heard wonderful things about Michael Ondaatje and since I live in Toronto, (near the Bloor Viaduct bridge described in the novel), I really did want to like this book. But honestly, I think watching the snow melt in my backyard would have been a more pleasurable experience than reading this book. And  just so you know, I don't generally read fluffy books -- I have a degree in English Literature, so I've read (and enjoyed) my share of ponderous, weighty, well-crafted novels.  I found the first 50 pages one of the most cruelly tedious introductions to a novel I have ever read in my life, but I trudged on and did find brief (all too brief) glimpses of magic. In particular, I was drawn in by the interplay between Clara and Patrick. In fact, Ondaatje is at his best when writing about relationships and at his worst when describing scenes with painstaking, mind-numbing detail. Yes, he's evidently done his research and so, can confidently drone on about the 'rivets, sheering valves and crown pins' involved in bridge building, but quite frankly, who cares?  There were a number of events in this novel that I just found so implausible, as though their only very obvious purpose the furthering of the plot. In particular, the scene where a nun is improbably blown off the edge of the under-construction bridge, only to be magically, single-handedly plucked out of the air by Temelcoff, hanging below in his harness, made me throw down the book in dismay. Then to add to the silliness, although Temelcoff has had his arm "ripped...out of its socket"  by this Superman-type rescue, the two traipse on down-- not to the hospital as one would imagine would be necessary-- but to a Macedonian bar to drink brandy and say not much of anything to each other. Oh brother!  Although others have described Ondaatje's style as lyrical, I just did not feel that at all. I found so much of the writing stilted, choppy and self-conscious. The dialogue  frequently banal and senseless. Here's a random sample: -You awake? -What time is it? she said -Still night. -Ahh. -I love you. Were you ever in love? Apart from Ambrose? -Yeah.   If you want to read a truly talented Canadian author who really does have a lyrical sensibility, read any of Margaret Atwood's books 
 This book is a bunch of biased rubbish.  Stay away! I have never before seen or read such an entirely one-sided piece of work.  It should be added that most of the premises Mr Chang's arguments are based on have been disproven by time.  This book is outdated and irrelevant. The author generalises every single "bad" event in recent Chinese history into a prediction for the future, and dismisses the obvious positives.  I was surprised at first, but since finding out his father was in the inner ranks of the Taiwanese govt, this doesn't surprise me.  It appears young Gordon was indoctrinated in his views early on. Not a paragraph in the book goes by without some generalisation about how "...the ones without freedom will rise up..."  "...the communist government will fail..." etc.  To the point where it becomes amusing. The best thing I can say is that I'm glad I took it out of the library and not bought it or received it as a present 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 This book is nowhere near Generation X (early 90s) but more of Generation Why (late 90s). The plot was good but the characters all seemed to be attempting to act older than they really were (and I think most of us can agree at 29 that we really didn't know as much at 19 as we thought we did). The ending seemed a bit unrealistic, with Abby getting a job in NYC before she even had a shred of fashion design experience under her belt. A final project in college doesn't mean squat in lieu of real experience.  And when she finally flew to the Big Apple, what happened to all her stuff?  She left behind her car, her pink and orange striped couch, and her "closet crammed with clothes".  The book doesn't say if she sold them, shipped them, etc.  A good attempt, but immature 
 Alain Daniélou's assessment of the dionysiac cults is somewhat naive. The Dionysaic cults are by no means just about free, ecstatic love and religious tolerance. As René Girard has shown, these cults are most of all about the sacrifice of an - innocent - scapecoat in order to regularly release the tensions which again and again build up in a society. Pagan societies, which do not know forgiveness, need this form of tension release in order to preserve or reinstate their unity. The origin of the dionysiac cult is the cruel and indeed ecstatic murder and paradox divinisation of the founder of a culture/society. In Indian mythology, for instance, Parusha was torn to pieces and out of the pieces came the four castes. This founding murder is again and again repeated in the dionysiac cult. Archaic forms of this cult used to sacrifice humans, later forms animals. The Holocaust is a modern form of dionysiac ecstasy. Daniélou of course does see very clearly that dionysiac ecstasy is tension release. What he does not see or know is that mere tension release is not all that is possible in lovemaking 
 This book reads like bullet statements. There is no fluidity at all and unfortunately terribly repetitive. I just completely lost it when it said...'Christianity is a religion of polytheism, believing in three gods in its teachings of the Trinity.' This is grossly inaccurate. Now I have to question the first half of the book. If this was said in the first 10 pages I would have just deleted the book and saved my time on the rest. I want to get a better understanding of Islam and Muslims so I am more cordial and respectful.  I want to do this without the feeling of being converted if I spoke with a Muslim. After reading this I feel like I might end up offending someone. So I will quit while I am ahead. You should do the same keep your money. 
 I almost wonder if I have the same book as the other reviewers.  I found this book very difficult to use. The chapters go on and on with theory and philosophy, but very little in the way of simple to follow exercises.  Also, the book assumes you are already familiar with Yoga and are comfortable doing long stretching exercises before you begin.  I became interested in breathing excercises from Andrew Weil's tapes that accompany the "8 weeks" book.  I was hoping for more exercises and perhaps even a couple of complete sets of exercises to go with what I had heard on the tapes.  I envisioned doing excercises at the office in the morning or at home before bed to improve health and reduce stress.  I did not need or want (yet) an exegesis of the theory of breath and health; nor was I looking for techniques that require special clothing, mats and pillows, and 10 minutes of set up.    If you want the full dose of theory, spirituality, new age physiology, etc., this is the book for you (and probably a very good one at that).  But if you are looking for a simple breathing book to introduce you to breath work, this is probably not the book for you 
  ''Here to stay'' is an ''OK'' song, but there are dozens of better bands than this. Complaint-Metal 
 Tendentious is the word for James Bamford's newest book.  Selective and slanted are other good ones.  Overall, his conclusions - presented as fact - can best be characterized as bad analysis.  This doesn't mean he has failed to consider facts that are, indeed, facts.  What it does mean is that he has both ignored other facts, believed his sources' assertions that may not stand up as fact, and extrapolated unnecessary conclusions from the facts he likes, based not on the facts themselves, but on his neon-sign-obvious political bent.  Don't be surprised that this is precisely what he accuses the Bush administration of doing.  Bamford will never be held accountable for the vacuity of many of his conclusions; intelligence professionals ARE, every day of the week.  This is a fact that makes a difference.  Bamford has mastered the art of provoking reaction in his reader, which is then used to carry the reader lightly over what is often quicksand.  He does this by hyperventilating, and throwing pieces of information into proximity for the apparent purpose of implying that they are related, even though he doesn't draw a credible link between them.  Examples abound in the book; here's one: on pp. 33-34 he launches a multi-paragraph discussion of the Defense Special Missile and Astronautics Center (DEFSMAC), which he erroneously characterizes as "among [the National Security Agency's] most secret units."  He introduces this excursion from the baseline story by lamenting that NSA finding out about the 9/11 attacks from CNN "was not the way it was supposed to be."  Bamford's discussion of DEFSMAC seems to imply that the intelligence community was under the impression DEFSMAC would provide it warning when terrorists hijacked commercial airplanes with the intention of flying them into buildings in New York and Washington.  Bamford knows enough about DEFSMAC to "get" that it relates in some way to air early warning, and breezily tells the reader how the cognoscenti pronounce its acronym ("deaf-smack").  But he either doesn't know or doesn't care that the 9/11 intelligence problem was not one of air early warning, but of knowing the intentions in the minds of terrorists.  The intelligence community has known for decades that DEFSMAC is not a tool for deciphering that.  It's weird to even mention it in this context.  Bamford in fact ignores information that has been available to the public for years on the whole community's effort to improve its collection and analysis capabilities against terrorism (primarily as a result of the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in 1996).  Both Bush II and Clinton increased antiterrorism intelligence funding every year after 1996, and both Congress and the executive agencies were well aware that better forms of intelligence were needed to interdict terror plots - and labored to cultivate them.  No one in the federal government thought DEFSMAC was either appropriate or adequate to provide warning against a non-military terrorist attack.  One cannot deduce anything complimentary to Bamford from the "free association" drive-by perpetrated here.  Perhaps I just got tired of hearing over and over again how individual X or agency Y "didn't bother" to perform action Z that is now obvious in hindsight.  These are the exact words used repeatedly:  "didn't bother"; applied with equal dismissiveness to politicians, intelligence personnel, and senior government staffers.  The words cheapen and distort the fact that we do indeed have shortcomings in our national intelligence collection and analysis; and one of these shortcomings is, indeed, agency parochialism and poor information sharing.  Perhaps there were, indeed, policy missteps in the Bush administration's handling of intelligence and decision-making.  But in neither case is the problem that people "didn't bother."  That sanctimonious shorthand is highly misleading and unhelpful; it certainly throws suspicion for me on the case Bamford is making against Bush's senior advisors.  So many, many questionable assertions or genuine errors.  On p. 210: "All along [Osama bin Laden's] goal, and that of his top leadership, was to draw the United States deeper and deeper into the sinkhole of a war in the Middle East."  On the contrary, bin Laden's goal all along has been to get the US, and other Western nations, OUT of the Middle East.  On p. 301, apropos of an informant report that 500 tons of uranium were to be shipped from Niger to Iraq:  "Then it was supposed to be 'transshipped in international waters.'  Apparently this meant that somehow, while two ships were bobbing alongside each other more than a dozen miles out in the ocean, five hundred tons of metal would be moved from one ship to another - an amazing feat."  Well, er, yeah.  It happens every day, actually.  The report was erroneous, but not because it's impossible to transfer cargo at sea.  On p. 313, Bamford implies that the following report from an Israeli intelligence informant was false: a report that Iraqi mobile weapons labs were labeled as "Tip Top Ice Cream" trucks, and that they transferred items to tractor trailers labeled "Segada Transportation Co."  His basis for suggesting this is the same as that of the UN inspectors who first received the information: "it was found that neither company, in fact, existed in Iraq."  It never seems to have crossed his mind (or even the UN inspectors') that Saddam's Iraq was not a place where a company had to be registered in order for a government entity to paint its name on the side of a truck.  There are, however, plenty of intelligence analysts throughout the world who could have told them that.  I won't bore you with further iterations.  It goes on and on.  Bamford uses a loose footnoting scheme that gives him a lot of latitude in attribution, and of course does not name some unrevealed number of his sources (whose motives in giving him classified information ought to figure as a big block of salt perched on top of this book).  Overall, he does a lot of things that a career Naval intelligence officer, like me, would have been fired for.  You won't know any more about WMD in Iraq after reading this book - you might read some things you haven't read before, but any belief that therefore you KNOW any more would be unfounded. 
 If you are looking for a good story and character development, this movie dissapoints. The story is rather thin and slow with more focus on Joe's good looks. A irritatating aspect of the DVD was white flashes occuring at  innapropriate moments during the movie 
 This book is a sure snooze-fest. Luckily for me I did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class. We read selected chapters of the book. They writing was horrible. Many parts were unclear. I had to reread what I read over and over. I can't stand this style of writing. Barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent. Instead, he comes off as boring and pretentious. Skip this book... try something else 
 Well, I guess it's been a while since I've been a college student. I'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now. I guess all college texts have ridiculous prices. This book used to be the best reference I've ever seen on basic electronics for non-EE's, and even for non-engineers. It's not much of a cookbook - instead, it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you're designing or adapting. The second ed. is getting long in the tooth, and since the book is used as a college text, it's preposterously overpriced. The one terrible thing about the book is that there are no answers to the (otherwise excellent) exercises, and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you're not sure about. It will be interesting to see what the 3rd ed. looks like. Maybe I'll start a web site and publish the answers online 
 A well organised book for full time statistic's students but not for part-timers or those with only a general interest in Statistics. This is an exam revision text 
 The story I found ho-hum, nothing really that amazing.  I thought the official 9/11 report much more interesting.    I was particularly distracted by Posner's overuse of footnotes -- not to be confused with endnotes, where an author documents his sources and are good, Posner likes to have footnotes sprinkled about on most pages.  This style is annoying b/c apparently (or as near as I can figure), there is no threshold in Posner's mind as to what qualifies as a footnote versus a regular paragraph.  A skilled author could easily have incorporated the relevant content of the footnotes into the main text.  Overall, ho hum.  Wish I didn't pay so much for the hard-cover version 
 This is D.H. Lawrence at his hobby horse again. He gives a portrayal of the risen Jesus after the crucifixion who is tired of life . . . weary of it all, with the life force at an all-time low. What can save him? Sex, of  course. What else? It's the same old song-and-dance. Lawrence seems to  think that the answer to all of life's problems is sexual union, which  makes about as much sense to me as regarding vegetable curry as the meaning  of life. Sex has it's place, to be sure, but I don't understand the primacy  that Lawrence ascribes to it in each and every one of his novels. In  certain instances, sex can revive a sense of purpose or ebbing energy, but  it cannot and will not aid anyone in a sense of world-weariness. If  attempted it will just be like trying to give live into a dead horse. It  would probably only make one feel all the more disgusted with existence  rather than giving one a sense of rejuvenation, as Sartre so adequately  demonstrates in his "Nausea". All, in all, i felt the whole  attempt was kind of silly. The Christians will get mad, the Lawrencians  will love it, but it is really just another testimony to one man's  inability to make sense of live in anyway other than genital terms 
 I'm all in favor of silly, irreverant books, but this book is just so pointless.  The author doesn't show any skill as a writer...it could basically have been anyone off the street making claims like "I hate TV animals...but I love Salem the cat from 'Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.'"  This book reads like a stream of concious exercise done by a ninth grader.  Who cares?  He doesn't say anything really interesting or eye-opening about why he does or doesn't like anything.  For his analysis of "Full House" (which he loved), all he did was sum up the show, then claim it wasn't self-important.  And, as some others have written, some of the items seem to contradict each other.  He loves the "loamy schlock" of "Full House," but hates the "corny, artificial"-ness of "The Brady Bunch."  Once again, WHO CARES 
 I bought this movie based on the rave customer reviews.  This definitely isn't a family-friendly or moral story.  The lead actress is from New York and is proposed to move in with her long time boyfriend.  The only reason she doesn't like the idea is because she wants a greater commitment (marriage) but not because she feels moving in is wrong.  Also a friend encourages her to lie non-chalantly at one point when she feels out of place in Wyoming.  We bought the movie on the pretense that there were no cuss words but H*** and D*** were sprinkled throughout the movie and only took away from what could've been a decent film.  Even outside of the non-family values and cursing it was slow moving 
 This book may seem like a great intro book to those well-versed in Telecommunications. However, the book does a terrible job of explaining terms and jargon. A word, for example, will be used for several pages before being defined. There are very few practical examples and metaphors to illustrate concepts and add interest to the book. There are no photographs here either, only basic illustrations which do not clarify concepts, but instead require explaination.  All of my classmates are disgusted that we are required to use this text. Plans are being set for a post-semester Essential-Guide-to-Telecommunications bonfire 
 Benford is one of those writers who wax hot and cold.  He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's "scientist" in that he deals with a lot of "hard" science.  In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring.  The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart.  The great experiment and the result were so-so.  I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored. I am reminded of the poem..."this is how the world ends - not with a bang but with a whimper.&quot 
 Not a bad overview of educational psychology, with plenty of resources for existing teachers to use in their instruction.  As such, the title of this book would more properly be "Educational Psychology for Teachers".  For psychologists and educational psychologists, it is rather inadequate, missing many of the new ideas in educational psychology that have not yet reached the "mainstream" of teaching, where Woolfolk resides.  Most distressingly, her adherence to traditional ideas in education is annoyingly pervasive and interferes with the reader's process of inquiry and the formation of their own conclusions.  As an educator herself, Woolfolk should know better that this 
 One of the most comprehensive books on the economic effects of immigration on the native population is "Heaven's Door" by Dr. George Borjas.  Dr. Borjas has for decades been trying to prove the adverse effects of immigration on natives.  Although his research has continued since 1999, "Heaven's Door" is his most recent major work.  Despite the author's obvious bias, the book should not be totally written off by either the pro-immigration or anti-immigration people.  The book is filled with references to studies conducted on the subject.  The author's reporting on the actual factual data is fantastic.  Dr. Borjas claims that his intention is to present the facts and not make policy recommendations.  Both sides can and have spun the facts contained in this book to support their pre-drawn conclusions on the effects of immigration.  And Dr. Borjas himself is included in this group.  One study done of the Mariel boat lift failed to find any adverse effects on the wages of lower skilled workers in Miami.  This was a surprise to most economists.  Dr. Borjas wrote it off.  His reason is that the wages of lower skilled workers in Miami fluctuated unexplainably at another time, and for some reason he feels this is sufficient to ignore the Mariel boat lift study.  But nevertheless, the book does describe the study briefly.  Despite his bias, the book contains relevant information.  But the book does NOT consider all the facts.  First, the book fails to consider the effects of immigration on the immigrants themselves and on their countries.  Second, in his policy recommendations, Dr. Borjas leaves out very relevant policies that could be implemented to alleviate the adverse effects of immigration [for example: policies to improve the productivity of the adversely affected native unskilled workers (merely graduating from high school can increase their earnings potential by 30%).  Borjas ignores this in his policy recommendation].  At the end of the book, Dr. Borjas offers his recommendations for U.S. immigration policy.  He recommends that the U.S. seek only its own interests and the interests of U.S. citizens.  Thus, in his policy recommendations, Borjas ignores any effects, good or bad, that his policy recommendations have on the rest of the world.  Borjas, who at the beginning of the book explains how important it is to be aware of all the facts, ignores this.  Even then, his policy recommendations are pitiful.  He recommends that the U.S. limit immigration to only skilled persons and that no unskilled or lower skilled persons should be admitted.  He proposes that 500,000 skilled immigrants be admitted annually.  The ramifications would be that the wages of skilled workers would be reduced thereby reducing the disparity between the wages of the skilled and unskilled.  He also openly admits that because of the reduced rate of return on education, that U.S. college enrollment would be expected to reduce by 15% and that those 15% would most likely be those that can least afford college.  As mentioned before, he ignores the effects on the rest of the world: that third world countries would lose their most valuable citizens (i.e. brain drain).  So under Borjas's plan, we would import skilled workers and permit our own citizens to do the chump labor.  This to me is pitiful.  A better policy would be to permit unskilled labor to come here meanwhile allocating resources towards improving the productivity of our own citizens.  Low skilled immigrants wash dishes, cut grass and hammer nails (and they're happy to do it; it's an improvement for them), meanwhile, U.S. citizens prepare tax returns, teach college courses, provide medical care and manage Fortune 500 companies.  It's a win-win situation 
 We need a one-volume history of European Integration, but not this five hundred page panegyric to...Margaret Thatcher?  In Gillingham's funhouse, Thatcher is the key figure in European Integration, receiving more attention than any of the individuals who actually tried to integrate Europe, most of whom are dismissed, often in very personal terms.  European integration indeed disappears from the book sometimes for sixty pages at a time while the author reviews political developments of right-wing governments in...New Zealand?  A very distorted understanding of European integration 
 This guy's message is how to limit yourself.  There are plenty of opportunities out there all you have to do is look.  Why struggle to make a bad employment situation better. Life is to short to to pay attention to nonsense like this.  I tried to rate this junk with less than one star but was prohibited from doing so 
 This book is targeted to users that are not new to programming. So, that's why I got the book since I know C++ and Java pretty well.  But even if I didn't, and i knew some JavaScript (AC is JavaScript pretty much), I would also be considered as the target reader. With that said, these are my thoughts: since I am not new to programming, that means I know the basics, I don't need lots of pages to tell me what a variable is in a super great detail; first pages tells me that I already should be familiar with it!  This book spends a lot of pages on describing what ActionScript is: what is a function, how to create a class, variables, etc etc.  Well, that is great, but ActionScript is A LOT more than knowing what a class is or what function is.  I want to know what I can DO with it, and in this area this books fails totally.  For example: I want to know how MovieClip object can be manipulated so I can put sensible code behind it and do something with it, or I want to know if I declare a variable, will it be visible on another timeline, or what I can do with the build in functions, etc etc.  In other words, this book teaches ABOUT ActionScript, but nothing really what you can DO WITH ActionScript.  Something like, if you know JavaScript language but don't know how browsers are using it, you can't program DHTML no matter how well you know JavaScript.  Same here, this book will tell you how ActionScript is constructed, but you will not know what to do with it to make your Flash movie shine.  ActionScript 2.0 Bible on the other hand teaches you what you can do with actionscript.  So, either get both books, or get the Bible if want only one book 
 This book bounces between the cute and the cliche.  The reader feels there is a real story-teller waiting to get out, but suffocating under the author's clumsy craftsmanship.  The immigrant "experience" is not deconstructed but frozen into solid pieces narrative, into obvious encounters with bigots and identity confusion/pursuit.  My best advice is that the potential reader should get the book out of library and save the cash for another book that will deserve a re-read 
 It has been a long time since I have some across a book as bad as this one.  Not only is the author a kind of apologist for Bill Gates, blithely dismissing Microsoft critics as jealous of a superior being and accusing the FTC of ignorance, but the content is decidedly third rate.  First, as a dated piece of work, the author goes over a list of controversies that should interest no one anymore, such as the first  proposed information superhighway subscriber schemes.  He also goes on and on about Myrvold as a prescient genius nerd, though Gates fired soon after the book was published for incompetence.  Second, what the author attempts to cover about how MS works is unbelievably banal, such as hiring the smartest people (instead of those with experience and credentials) or the way that offices are configured.  As such, the book was of absolutely no use for question os how MS really does things.  Moreover, the edition I got was sloppily printed:  a page is missing, there are whole sections in which no periods appear and the like.  Finally, the style is boring and hard to follow.  Not recommended.  There are far better books on MS available 
 I think it was written for people with a basic knowledge of football and not the non-fan. The terms in the glossary didn't  make sense to me at all. Decided to forget about finishing the book and just make appetizers instead for the actual fans. Sorry but it didn't inspire me to learn about the game at all 
 many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know. But to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds. This is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music. Another double ambient album - Seti - Pharos - is a real masterpiece. It is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning - but - you know - never judge the cover by its album.  Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts. 
 This Suduko handheld game was not user friendly. I returned it for a full refund 
 Look I enjoyed the book a lot, but got nearer and nearer to the end and noticed the plot wasn't wrapping up.  I got that awful sinking feeling that I had been suckered into a book without a good ending, without closure, which I HATE.  Sure enough!  At the bottom of the last page they *FINALLY* admit "Armageddon's Children ends here.  The story will continue with the publication of Terry Brooks's next novel."  NOWHERE on the front cover, back cover or ANYWHERE ELSE but on the last page does it mention this.  I hate being manipulated, and that's why I gave the book one star, and why the publisher Del Ray/Ballantine Books will never get another cent from me 
 Don't bother with this one.  The illustrations are poor and there should have been more photographs of interesting knives.  The material is very general and sketchy.  A book that goes into a great amount of detail on any particular part of the subject would be more interesting and useful.  I think most people would prefer a book showing in detail the mechanics of switchblades and some of the pattent drawings.  A book about collectable button knives and their values might be popular too.  I would like to read more about the Estes Kefauver and the motivations of other people in office that write and pass stupid laws regulating pocket knives 
 Very few songs I hoped for on this album. I bought it only because I had free shipping if I bought enough stuff. Never agai 
 Maybe something got lost in translation but I think the wording and the sentences uttered by Ka and others seemed as if they were written by 5th graders.  I couldn't imagine people talking like this.  I forced myself to finish the book but the wording just "hurt my ears".  I read it based on the New York Times basically saying it was a great book.  This was not a great book, but maybe the translation was just bad??  Also, I am not sure if the author meant it or not but I got the impression from the writing and story that Turkish people aren't that bright.  It seemed to me he was putting down the muslim religion.  Anyway, that was minor, the writing was just bad, bad, bad. If you want to read stories that flow and wording that is like music to your ears (even though translated) read works by Naguib Mahfouz, especially The Cairo Trilogy. Now that is good stuff! 
 The rest of the reviewers wrote glowing responses to this book.  From our perspective, it could include more background and easily to understand steps on how to utilize some of the tools, techniques, and methods of compression.    Are there any other books out there for digital compression in more detail that take into consideration the latest technology issues that might have a bearing such as DTV, HDTV, World Wide Uses on legacy systems as well as state of the art systems 
 Before watching the movie, I had read the book.  Consequently, I was looking forward to seeing the story come to life on the silver screen.  Unfortunately, the story didn't survive its on-screen adaptation.  Although many of the events were similar, the film lost much of the hideous reality of Augustine Burrough's childhood.  Reading the book, I could see how something like this could happen in real life.  However, the movie Hollywood-ized the original story to make it palatable to the common movie-goer, who seems to like things tidy.  The Finch home in the story bristled with life.  Its messiness seemed to leap from the page.  The movie killed that life.  I felt distanced from the mess.  I didn't live with it like I did when reading the book.  I wanted to see the remains of last month's meal lying on top of the television.  I wanted to see the roaches crawling across the unwashed dishes in the kitchen. Instead, we got long shots of the mess that didn't allow us to really look at it.    I was also displeased with the changes to the story itself.  Instead of many children, Dr. Finch had only two.  In real life, a man like that would have more than two children.  It just makes sense because of his philosophy on life being less than conservative.  In addition, the extra children made the family seem larger and crazier.  As I was reading, I could hardly keep everyone straight.  Also, Agnes in the movie was transformed into a foil for Augustine's mother.  Although Agnes wasn't a perfect mother in the movie, she was better than Deidre.  She gave Augustine a small piece of sanity in an otherwise chaotic world.  In the book Augustine didn't seem to have that.  Agnes certainly wasn't put together enough to be a mother to him.  Instead, she seemed to me to be an embodiment of the house-- broken and in need of repair.  But Hollywood seems to need things neat and tidy.  It needs to give Augustine a mother when he needs one.    However, real life isn't like that.  In real life it can happen that a child like Augustine could be left adrift without anyone at all.  The Augustine of the memoir didn't seem to have anyone to turn to, unless you count Neil Bookman, the disturbed older man who practically raped Augustine during their first sexual encounter, or Natalie, who was just as lost as Augustine was, if not more so.    As for Natalie herself... in the book, she was very self-conscious about her weight.  She and Augustine would eat at McDonald's, and she'd call herself a cow.  In the movie, she was thin and, despite the heavy makeup, almost model-worthy.  Again, the movie took a real life person and shaped her into a Hollywood version of herself.  And Hope was even more of a stereotype than a real person.  She was just crazy and frigid.  We didn't see the side of her that was a friend to Augustine in the early years.    In short, the movie sucked the life out of the book and created a bland, un-entertaining cliche of a film that wasn't even interesting in its own right, let alone when being compared to the book.  My two friends who'd never read the book didn't like it any more than I did.  I just want to yell at Hollywood to stop imitating itself.  It's like the execs have found a formula, and they are afraid to deviate from it, even for something more interesting.  If they'd have stuck to the book a little more closely and been more true to life, people would have wanted to watch   because of how real it was-- and how surreal.  What kept me reading was that I knew that Augustine's kind of life was being lived right now.  I'm an English teacher, and I often wonder what kinds of homes my students go to.  The book opened that world up to me, and although I didn't like what I saw, I could understand it better having read about it.  Sadly, the movie took all that poignancy away and left a hollow shell.  The only redeeming part of the movie was its soundtrack, which somehow made the film more tolerable.  Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  I would, however, recommend the book.  It was an interesting read about an interesting life, and the movie didn't even come close to doing it justice 
 Compact and cute, with lots and lots of places to record just how often your child defecates and urinates and what color its eyes are.  The novel hook is comparing your baby's record to a maintainence log on a new car.  Office visits are "service records".  Some handy boxed tips, a couple of graphics, but very little information.  Probably better for the glove compartment than the diaper bag 
 I bought one of these about 3 days ago and it's already broken. I try to charge my ipaq1940 with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my PDA. Not only that, but it drains rather than charges the battery. This is an extremely overpriced piece of junk, you'd be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you're trying to charge into one smart phone/pda/whatever that does everything you want 
 THE DEMOLISHED MAN is the story of crazy gazillionaire industrialist Ben Reich, who is determined to murder his arch business rival, Craye D'Courtney. In this future world, people with ESP are employed in all professional levels of the job market. It is impossible to get away with murder when all the cops, doctors, lawyers, etc can read a person's intentions and stop him before he can fully think about, much less commit, such a deed. Nevertheless, Reich does commit the murder, and most of the book is taken up with his attempted flight from the clutches of Esper Police Prefect Lincoln Powell.   I know, I know, this book is supposed to be a classic, but I thought it was a real stinker. It reads like a smarmy 50s cops-and-robbers story, which is essentially what it is - only set in the future with telepaths. Don't get me started on the character development! All the female characters are either a) breast-heaving, snuggle-kittens or b) crazy death crones. Just awful.  
 "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.  You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.  Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.  The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.  Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.  The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.

 I picked this up for some light reading after the recent tragedies, having read several of the author's previous books. This one is not up to par. The plot is uninvolving and a chore to get through. There is little wit and fewer surprises, and Falco seems uncharactistically heavy-hearted. Even the "Roman" details have gone missing; essentially, this mundane tale could have taken place anywhere. Looks like this series has run out of steam 
 Spiritchaser is Dead Can Dance's seventh and last studio album, and sees them forging deeper into realms of ethnic music. Unfortunately, this is also their least successful album musically, and is a bad place for anyone unfamiliar with the group to start their explorations.   One criticism leveled at recent prior albums by the group was that the duo of Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard appeared to be getting more and more disconnected from one another musically, with albums featuring a succession of "his" and "her" songs. The two appear to be attempting to rectify that failing throughout this album, with more integrated vocals and more of a group feel throughout. There is a greater emphasis on percussion and drumming, as well as the reintroduction of some electric guitar, mostly unheard on the duo's albums since their second album some 11 years earlier.   Alas, most of the percussion is uninspired, and although several songs begin with promise, almost all outstay their welcome: the opening track, Nierika, ultimately becomes repetitive and boring, the exciting opening four minutes of Song of the Stars (featuring Brendan reading an Iroquois invocation over drones and native drumming), gives way to an interminable six more minutes of guitar noodling and chanting, the initially catchy The Snake and The Moon devolves into repetitive vocal refrains, and even the addition of gamelan to the instrumentation of the eight minute long Song of the Nile can't save it from tedium. Worst of all is Brendan's cringe-inducing stab at Caribbean music in Song of the Dispossessed; one keeps waiting for him to burst out in a chorus of "Day-O!"  Along with the beginning of Song of the Stars, two tracks save this album from wretchedness: the middle eastern flavored song Indus, which at over nine minutes is a bit long, but Lisa's vivid singing carries the listener along, and the absolutely gorgeous closing track by Lisa, Devorzhum. This wordless song has been used in at least two movies, and it's easy to see why. Lisa's singing is at its sweetest and most achingly beautiful here, and drifts atop a layer of drones and gentle guitar strings. By itself this song almost justifies the purchase of the album.  An instrumental outtake from the Spiritchaser recording sessions, Sambatiki, was released as part of the 1996 concert tour souvenir book, and also appears on the DCD box set. It features the same drumming, twangy electric guitar and ethnic instrumentation as much of the rest of the album, but somehow works better than most tracks that unfortunately made it on to the final release.  For those just beginning to explore Dead Can Dance, move on now and come back to this album later if you know you love the group and have to have everything they ever produced. A better starting point for beginners would be the live album Toward the Within, the early collection A Passage In Time, which features their pre-1990 work, or the career spanning two disc retrospective, Wake, though this last has some rather odd choices in the track listing. 
 I purchased this book because as a David Sedaris fan it was recommended to me by Amazon ("if you like this book, you'll like..."). After reading a few pages I realized that the only thing David Sedaris and Rakoff have in common is their first name.  Sedaris engages his readers and accompanies them on the journey he puts forth in print. Rakoff however, throws his words at the reader and runs away, abandoning the reader in a quagmire of over-thought words and phrases. I'm an educated person, but Rakoff uses words that I've never heard before. You need to read this book with an accompanying dictionary.  There is at least one word per page that you'll have to lookup, even if you're a college professor.  I tried to finish this book, but only made it about  way through. It was too much work, and I like to read for pleasure. 
 If you are not educated in mythology and the like, skip this book. I thought it would describe the history of the Inca Empire and mention mythology while doing so, but this book is MAINLY about the mythology itself. Only for experts in the field if you ask me, not for the general public. Written in a boring style 
 The water filter for the Braun Flavorselect 12 cup coffee maker Model KF187 is a great design.  I rate it #5 for it's design, but since my original purchase of the coffee maker, I can't find the filter units anywhere 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 Dr. Benner notes that 87% of surveyed pastors wished they had more pastoral counseling training, and that they thereby regard themselves as unprepared for counseling circumstances they encounter, despite seminary training and a large number of books published on the subject. This sense of pastoral inadequacy has spurred Benner to write Strategic Pastoral Counseling, which hopes to address the lack of practical pastoral counseling guides by providing busy pastors with a framework or methodology for effective counseling.   While most books can take on an overly theoretical tone, Benner has intended that his book, while theoretically sound, should act as a very practical sourcebook for pastors, providing them with a schema or algorithm for managing their counseling challenges. Benner briefly surveys the history of pastoral counseling, ***although limiting himself to the last century of thought***. This done, he reviews the range of counseling forms offered within the church, from formal discussions with the pastor to simple forms of friendship among church members. He also notes the unique nature of pastoral counseling and the unique but perhaps insufficient qualifications that pastors possess by virtue of their specialized education. Lastly, before detailing his pastoral schema, he reflects on the goal of effective pastoral counseling, spiritual growth in a Christian context.  Benner's methodology, what he describes as "strategic pastoral counseling", is "brief and time-limited, holistic, structured, involves assigned work between sessions, and is church-based, spiritually focused and explicitly Christian." Benner works out each of these characteristics in some detail, and then turns to a practical discussion of how these various qualities can be achieved with a particular conversational methodology, involving "encounter, engagement, and disengagement". Benner helpfully suggests a maximum of 5 visits with counselees to bound the scope of counseling discussions and safeguard the busy pastor's schedule.  Benner concludes his presentation with two representative case studies which illustrate his recommended strategy in practice. These case studies survey the range of pastoral counseling commitments: one a five-week engagement with a very difficult counseling situation, and another single-visit circumstance. In both case studies, he provides representative dialog along with a running commentary on how his strategy is worked out in practice.  Strategic Pastoral Counseling contains a few regrettable references to women pastors, and has few roots in Scriptural observations, but nonetheless provides some useful considerations for pastors or prospective pastors who are wondering how to effectively counsel the members of their spiritual community amidst a busy schedule.   Overall, points subtracted for failing to spring from a historically informed view of the Church and her activities, especially a familiarity with the old post-Reformation pastors of the soul. For example, why is no one asking why pervasive professional "counseling" only appeared relatively recently among us? Are we the best and brightest generation? Were the old guys just dolts? What were they doing with those under their care? Worth some thought, but few are inquiring.. 
 Someone just today told me I should see this film.  What a disappointment to see these warnings of poor quality DVDs being produced by Fox Lorber.  Oh well 
 Eugene O'Neill may have been the father of American theatre, but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in Long Day's Journey into Night. O'Neill's characters were shallow, pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.The father-son relationship between James Tyrone and his son, Jamie, is meanspirited, and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems. Tyrone regularly refers to Jamie as a useless failure, and a drunk, not only to his face but to other family members, and in turn Jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son, Edmund. Tyrone says such things as "You'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life!"(p.32) and comments to Edmund that, "If he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey, he's never shown it."(p.131). The characters of the parents are pathetic, the mother all fluttery and drugged, and the father as the stereotypical old, cheap, and mean failed celebrity. The only seemingly normal relationship is between Edmund and Jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love. The relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural, they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds. It is as if they entire family is bipolar.  Long Day's Journey into Night was based on the life of O'Neill himself, with the character of Edmund as O'Neill. The mother of O'Neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between O'Neill and his older brother, and his father never accepted O'Neill for who he was. These sad beginnings continued throughout the life of O'Neill and was evident in the writing of this piece. If the characters in Long Day's Journey into Night are closely based on his family members then O'Neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine 
 As a jazz guitarist you always listen for what you can learn from someone, what they do well and not well. Russell is an amazing talent when it comes to chord melody playing. His voicings, along with slick tricks using harmonics makes for a beautiful addition to the standard approach to playing jazz guitar chord melody. What makes this CD difficult to listen to is his playing in time or with the rhythm section. His lines are mostly un inventive and have a very awkward feel. It does not have the feel of say, Grant Green or George Benson. It sounds as if his picking is not worked out well and subtracts from the over all rhythmic feel of the music. I would love to hear a record of just solo guitar from this artist 
 The NATURE'S FIRE VOLCANO also used to be sold at the Discovery Channel Stores. My kid loved it while it worked. Lasted about a month. All of the reviews stated the same on their site. Lasts from 1 to 3 months. Wish I had checked it before we bought it. Save your money 
 Bland does not adequately connect the medieval and the modern, leaving a gap between the two periods. Further, he is clearly more adept at analyzing the medieval period as his discussion of the modern lacks the same level of critical penetration. In sum, I found Bland's book to be bland 
 This book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating...well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle.  Read "The Fat Fallacy" instead, it provides much more practical information 
 I had high hopes for this DVD as I'm looking for good insightful information re 9/11, especially in relation to the collapse of Building 7. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed and really learned little from it. It is like a home movie in real time. Could be edited to a fraction of its length and not loose much. Yes, devastation was shown but that alone is not sufficient to make it worthwhile. Of course Steve Spak did not know WTC7 was going to collapse but one reviewer referred to the fires in it, as though there was significant information in the DVD about them. There is not. No hard feelings but I wasted my money 
 I was bored with this book.  The end was terrible, and the relationships never really evolved.  The plot took place to late in the book, with nothing happening in the end.  I don't recommend this book. If I would have paid more than $6.99 for this, I would have been mad 
 Zero stars, for a product not yet out. (5 for a great series though)While a few of the initial reviews, or should I say PREviews listing episodes, are informative, none of these writings here really do me, or most consumers any good, SINCE THIS ITEM HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED! Amazon does the average consumer a disservice in printing these glowing, drooling reviews before we have seen the product - quality, the ACTUAL episodes released, packaging, possible defects (like the Magnum series & Maiden's last Live DVD, both featured defective sections...) when the product IS released, I will have to wade through 7 (as of Oct 3) B.S. PRE-views in order in order to gain actual product knowledge before buying... These PRE'S, are presented by: fans? Industry Sales schmucks? Amazon employees? Who knows, pre-buyer beware...   
 At the beginning of the book when Avery was mistaken after the mishap and was Carole's ringer the story was a real thriller. After you read more pages the story starts to go out of the main plot and repeating itself pretty much. How many times could you read in a book explicit sex scenes? Maybe 9 or 10? That means that in this book SB hadn't anything else to write to fill 442 pages. The last 100 pages or so are heavy as lead and all you'll read there will be Tate's campaign and two or three pages of the main plot. So I think that if this book were written with 150 pages less and always be in the main plot would have been a great thriller 
 It is interesting to see all of the gushing reviews of this film.  I found nothing socially relevant, compelling, insightful or even remotely interesting in this film.  The pace is like watching a turtle race and creates a film that IS dull.  There is nothing to like or empathize with in any of the characters.  If your going to waste your time with any of the "Three Colors" films, watch White 
 This is a required text at my school, but after having read the first 5 chapters there is almost nothing of value that I have read.  I have spoken to several people that have used this text for the class in prior semesters and they told me that they had stopped reading it after the first several chapters also 
 Like a few of the reviewers have already mentioned, I thought that the book would be spiral bound with tabs.  It's not - it's just a paperback book.  1.  The author wrote very little and mostly compiled suggestions from women with ADD. 2.  There are too many chapters to keep track of. 3.  The suggestions are vaguely grouped, but not particularly well.  There are a number of repeat suggestions.  I had to take notes outside the book or I'd never be able to find the useful hints.  Like most of the women-oriented ADD books, the "women" oriented material is really "mother" or "home-maker" material.  This is particularly complicated by the fact that the quotes aren't organized at all, so I get suggestions about how many hours a day I should spend cleaning the various locations in my house when I only have 8 hours available outside of work.  Plenty of women are mothers but plenty of women aren't.  Read "ADD-Friendly ways to Organize your Life" instead.  It's *packed* with useful suggestions, and it's in a very ADD-friendly format.  After that, you could try this book 
 This books is a load of nonsense. A prime example of pop spirituality.   There are things in this book that are factually WRONG!!   This nonsense is to philosophy and spirituality what a fastfood hamburger is to cuisine.... you know what? That comparison is unfair. This book is far worse to the spiritual well being of a person than hamburgers are to the physical. 
 Drag performances tend to be funny and light.  Of course, studying gender  and studying gender in relation to theatre warrants a "heavier"  reading of such performances..... But STILL, this book is as fat as a  binder and is as dense as a computer manual....  Nothing you could read  from cover to cover -- and I think that this would have been a lot more  fun 
 I usually start my reviews with positive comments, followed by negative ones. This time, I'm going to do it other way around.  This book is all wrong.  The lead character is so perfect, to the point of being terribly annoying. She is so smart, athletic, witty, pretty, sexy, strategically brilliant, lucky, emotionally stable and fearless that Superman himself would be ashamed. I can't give way examples of mentioned traits without giving away spoilers, but trust me I'm not being cynic or spiteful, but merely realistic. The villains (the whole bunch of Thay's zulkirs and other Red Wizards) are so simplified and outright stupid, that it is really insulting. They actually let themselves be ordered by slaves. Characters have no plausible motivations behind their actions, and contradict themselves page after page. This book disregards (a mild word) all the good work Wizards of the Coast developers have done in and around the land of Thay in the last few years. The villains have a tendency of explaining their scheming to their enemies, and all of the characters have a tendency to speak to themselves (or "to no one in particular" as the author likes to put it). The plot is choppy, but otherwise is not as bad as the rest of the elements in this book. There are a lot of logical errors in it, but that goes on the editor(s). I liked Whitney-Robinson's book in the Spider Queen series, and I really can't perceive the reason behind this novel's such poor quality. I have a feeling that this book was written with a lot of love for its main character and minimal effort otherwise.  Otherwise, I liked one of the supporting characters, Justikar, and that is probably the only thing I liked. It might have been different if I was under ten years of age. In fact, this book might be well suited for younger audience.   Besides Elminster Series (I know Greenwood has a lot of fans who won't agree with me on this one), and first three books of Avatar Series, probably the worst novel to come out of TSR/WotC publishing.            
 It is necessary to correct the current trend of public commentary, which tends, systematically, not to understand events in the former Yugoslavia but to construct a propagandistic version of Balkan rivalries, designed to validate the existing post-modern myths and prejudices. This book faithfully reflects the post-modern blinkers that its author has helped first create and then perpetuate in his "coverage" of the Wars of Yugoslav Succession. This book reflects his (and their) belief that the Orthodox nations of Southeast Europe - embodied in "the Serbs" - are The Other vis-a-vis "The West" in the Huntingtonian sense. The author's assumptions are prejudiced in a coarse, primordial manner.   Judah's mindset helps us understand why the problem of the Balkans under UN/EU/NATO/UNMIK/KFOR/SFOR. . . is inseparable from the quandary of America under the bipartisan regime inside the Beltway, or that of Europe "united" under the Leviathan of Brussels. This book unintentionally poses many questions, and answers none. Can any meaningful unity of nations sharing European heritage be restored? To what extent, how, and why has the modern, secular, "post-Christian" West inherited the antipathy of West to the carriers of the Byzantine tradition? How do those two traditions converge, and how do they diverge, amidst the continuing onslaught of globalized secularism? Such issues are not merely political. They are as much "cultural" as theological, and they have been political all along. It is on the way we deal with them today that the future of our civilization will depend, and it that endeavor Judah has decided to side with the bad guys.  A book is badly needed to counter Judah's prejudice and ignorance about an area of the Old Continent which need never be the "powder keg of Europe." Though the Balkans, however delineated, contain many states and even more nations, they have one thing in common: for most of history they have not been masters of their own fate, but objects of policy by dominant outside powers. Though depicted by Judah as aggressing against their neighbors and generating wider conflicts, the Serbs in most cases had these conflicts foisted upon them by powerful outsiders and their local minions.  In particular Judah's attempt to relativize the Ustasha genocide of some 500-700,000 Serbs is scandalous. Had the same apparatus of quasi-historical whitewash been applied to the victims of Treblinka, such book surely would not have seen the light of day - and rightly so.  Even if all history-as a philosopher argued-is in some measure contemporary history, it need not be dominated by the obsessions of the day. The cause of tolerance in a troubled region can never be advanced by misrepresentation or by the sentimental lapse of seriousness which judges one patriotism as admirable and condemns another as inadmissible. This book is found wanting on all fronts 
 Contains many well corroborated general guidelines regarding improved diet and nutrition. However, the author often takes these guidelines to the extreme. Discerning readers will carefully consider his recommendations before implementing them. Yes, cooking in microwave ovens probably should be avoided especially by health compromised people but they are very much in use in Russia today- they were reinstated ten years before the copyright date. And I doubt that microwave ovens render meat protein useless. Also, Dr. Young seems to have too many proprietary interests which of course raise questions about potential conflicts of interest and, therefore, the validity of his dietary claims.   I tried to confirm a few of his stated "facts" by trying them myself;I could not. Use common sense when you read about corn, peanuts, and mushrooms.  I am juicing green vegetables daily and love it. I expected more from a Ph.D.   
 "In My Country" is undermined straight from the start by its tone deaf casting. This film - based on the narrative writings of stellar South African journalist Antjie Krog - somehow gets a starring duo of a Frenchwoman and Irishman playing Afrikaaners and an American (Samuel L. Jackson) ludicrousy grafted on top of the screenplay for the sake of starpower and a wacky, contrived melodrama that never existed in Krog's tale.  This is most unfortunate because Krog's stories - her take on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission - is one that should be heard far and wide.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers bury that behind this odd and inexplicable need to feature a quasi-adulterous liaison between Binoche and Jackson's characters.  How did it turn out?  Take a look at the DVD extras:  Samuel L. Jackson is nowhere to be found.  This is a man who knows quality and knows junk.  He must taken a look at the final product and ran from this thing as fast as he could.    Good move. Smart guy 
 This book was a bunch of garbage. It takes the money of fools and gives them cliche false hope. My stupid roommate was listening and I heard such lines as "look at a picture of Albert Einstein, and know that you could be an EInstein." Anyone who was stupid enough to buy this book will never be a genuis. This book is for the fools    trying to figure out how to be someone great, instead of just being great. 
 In high school "Stroke You Up" was the jam, so I went downtown and bought the cassette. Let me tell you something: It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring. Even "Stroke You Up" became unbearable to listen to. No funk, no groove- just lukewarm soul. That was the first *and* the last time I listened to "Changing Faces." The two chicks who made up "Changing Faces" had airy, monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all. Even the album cover looked boring. These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all. Skip this at all costs and get Zhane 
 The first dishwasher that I received from Etronics was dented, dirty and looked as though it had been used.  I complained, they picked it up, and one month later I got the replacement.  It wasn't in much better shape, but I kept it anyway because I was tired of waiting. The dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes, and although it cleans well, the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made, and it leaks even with teflon tape.  I would not make this purchase again 
 This is one of those "go to" books that racists use to justify their policies.    
 while i liked some interesting facts,i was shocked at her advocating killing sparrows and happy at starlings killed, killing wild animals just cause we dont like them is not right and shouldnt be glorified-or ecommended!not thier fault thier born here,  shocked at this approach 
 I was given a copy of this book when my son, Zachary was born.  As another reviewer mentioned, it was quite scary reading all the things that MIGHT be wrong with him medically, along with the quotes from parents the author included.  I'm sure the quotes were a well-meaning inclusion from the author - but each and every one I would review to be extremely non-descript, even bordering negative.  As a parent of a child with DS - I can tell you first-hand that my experience has been nothing but non-descript...but overwhelmingly positive.  My son, at less than 2 years old, has already brought so much joy into our lives and countless others.  A child with Down Syndrome is a blessing in disguise.  He give to me so much more than I give to him as you wil hear from just about ANY parent with a DS child - but not from the author or the outdated quotes she chooses to include in her book. 
 The audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep. Not a good thing while drivin 
 Matthew Sweet by himself is good. "Girlfriend" is a classic cd. Suzanna Hoff is many years past her prime and the Bangles were...okay.  This cd is bad. The versions are week and detract from the original songs. Sweet and Hoffs have no synergy. Why are they even together? They add nothing to these songs and simply sound like a wedding band doing covers.  Did you see them on the talk shows (Conan, Leno). They were horrible!    If Matthew Sweet doesn't lose weight, he may not be able to ever get a "Girlfriend".  This seems like a desperate attempt to make money. A better covers cd is the Def Leopard one 
 The authors call Hong Kong a "highly developed country with few natrual resources" while China is a less developed country with a great deal of natrual resources. For the price and edition number, both the authors and the editors should have caught that error - enough said 
 I bought this book, because I am very excited and eager to learn about ActionSctipting in Flash MX 2004. As others have noted, all of the references and examples in this book are based upon the interface of Flash MX. Aside from that very bad, misleading point -- this book has ZERO personality. The pages drudge on and on with points that have no supporting explanation or examples. I have busted out into out-loud laughter at how poorly this book is written. If this book had a voice, it would be the voice of Ben Stein as the teacher in Faris Beuler's Day Off. Avoid this book like the plague. There are several other books out there that are much more helpful. (incidentally, this is the FIRST time I've ever panned a book on Amazon... I feel such incredible obligation, that I'm taking the time to do it now. 
 Ok there are a few things I noticed wrong with this book. First, the quantities seem to be off, probably b/c the author is british, and the UK cups are different than the cups here. Second, the book is poorly organized - one would have to flip through most of it to find a recipe, since there are only four divisions - which I believe are appetizers, salads and light meals, main entrees, and deserts. And third, the recipes are just not practical to make - I like to try new things, but this book takes the exotic really too far. Plus she uses a lot of specialty ingredients that one would have to go hunting for. I found the whole book disappointing 
 I found this book to be very repetitious and containing quite a few grammatical errors.  This detracted from what could have been a wonderful story 
   I saw this set at the store and it was a magnificent picture.  Has an integrated HDTV tuner and all the connections you will need.  Looks sweet, too.  However, I got one off Amazon which was a dud.  Poor picture quality and white light bleed from the top and bottom of the screen (a problem another customer complained about).  Samsung telephone service help was great and agreed it was defective.  Amazon was terrific and paid for the return and refund.  Be careful with this set and wait a little for other feedback.   Oh, one annoying feature.  While the HDTV tuner works well, you cannot dial in a specific digital channel (like 10.1) unless the search program has previously found it.  And there is no way to "save" the found digital channels so that you can reposition the antennae, search for signals again, and then have a compiled list channels locked into the memory.  In other words, if your search found 10.1 in one antenna position but not 6.1, there is no way the TV will let you dial in 6.1 even if you reposition the antenna optimally.  You must then reprogram the search to find 6.1, but then after that is completed you wont be able to dial in 10.1 after turning antenna back because the TV did not permanently store that channel prior to the new search.  My 32" Sony 960XBR can do this no problem 
 There is so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to begin, so let's start with the obvious; why is Keanu Reeves in this movie? Who thinks this robot can deliver any credibility in any movie? Winona Ryder is equally horrid and her role is that much more vital. Her gasping doe-eyed schtick is woefully inadequate to convey the power and allure of the woman Vlad pledges unending blood lust in search of. Furthermore, were there no Brits that could play these two roles or were British accents really necessary at all? If so, why in the name of Bumblebee Man did they have to use these wankers who can't keep one going consistently? Gary Oldman - an actor whose work I usually enjoy - is sadly over the top in a role that cries out for subtlety, especially when you consider how much of a cliche this character has become. His garbled accent and the hokey theatrics make me want to giggle more than stay engaged. In fact, my sixteen year old daughter and I cracked up so many times throughout this that you'd have thought we were watching a comedy...and that's not a compliment. There is just so much to laugh at and mock... On the plus side, I thought Coppola's back story of the romance and all was interesting, but in the end, who cares? It is nearly impossible to immerse yourself in the story because Reeves, Ryder, Oldham, and Hopkins are so wretched that you end up wishing it was a comedy - it works better on that level. If you want a good untraditional vampire movie, go rent The Hunger instead. 
 Food: A Culinary History is our History book for our culinary class. This book was very long and had a lot of information on the history of food. Anything you need to know about Food History from Prehistory onto the development of McDonalds today. This book had a lot of useless information that did not need to be read. I do not suggest this as a book to read. This book may be good to go over in a class with a teacher, but not as a book to just read. It is not really a novel, it just talks about history. Any History book that is huge is not enjoyable to read. The book was about the different cultures and food origins of different countries. The book did not keep me very interested. It did not keep my attention; I kept drifting off because it was so boring. I noticed they focused on certain points that did not seem very important. There was too much information that was piled all into one book. The content could have been organized in a more orderly fashion rather going from European cultures to the Indies back to European food. The book was on a higher level than the readers. It was hard for me to read and interpret what the author was trying to say. Although the book was good into putting every little fact about the culinary history all into one book. It would be good to be taken a small bit at a time. I do not request this a book to read 
 I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It is completely useless. There are only exersises in this book and Ravenwolf isn't bothering about any safety methods. Some of the exersises are fine, but you would find them in other books too 
 Ok, first of all, read that ttle again. Don't you love how idiotic grown ups sounds when they try to, like, borrow the vernacular twists of their offspring for ironic employment in a, like, polemical setting? Reminds me of Cusack's dad in 'Better off Dead,' the way he keeps trying to talk to his son on his son's level. There's so much bad faith and pretension permeating this book- it's all there in the title...  As for the' author's "polemic," it basically consits of numerous, misinformed, tendentious tracts soldered together into a rusty heap. You've heard this spiel before, most likely from your grandparents or parents who just don't get it- that they had their time. This is our era. Our use of language reflects and underlines our differences from those who came before.   I particularly didn't like his seeming dismissal/blanket statement on hip hop. He really ain't down with the brothas, which is not surprising, given that he's a black intellectual, and there's nothing established black academics like more than a long-winded, whingeing harangue about the endemic evils of hip hop Kulture. Ugh. He doesn't even seem to possess much of a knowledge of hip hop artists or their work... Nada... There is much that I find execrable in said culture and in it's major 'artists' but still how can one overlook its myriad unifying and artistic elements... Even I manage not to fall prey to an all-too-easy reductionist formula, which seems to be the The main point here- the author views the degredation of the english Language through the lens of pop culture at large (as a bad thing, mind you), it begins in the evil counterculture 60's and... you know...   Digressive, ranting out-of-context mixed with counter-intuitive psuedo-linguistic gibberish. For example, the author holds up both Dylan and Tom waits as examples of artists who are reverred not for their songwriting abilities, but more for their authenticity, thir 'genuineness'. This is plain false. Laughably false. I've never met a fan of either artist who wasn't struck by their strange and completely idiosyncratic use of language. Moreover, the author seems to feel that pop culture music is driven by whites emulating blacks. True, up to a point. I love this stance, and from Chuck Berry to James Brown to Miles Davis to Funkadelic to Fishbone to Bad Brains, to the innumerable black influences on The Clash, I will never tire of pointing out that, basically, it's all black music. One would think that, at least on some level, this is a good thing... But no, it leads back to the counter-kulture (with a k) ideals that have subverted language...????   HUH?  The saddest thing is that, as a reactionary elitist, I'm inclined to agree with many of the author's basic points. But both his presentation and his defense of his points were so hare-brained and wrong, I just felt sullied. With friends like these...  
 I had originally seen this book as a subject of PBS' Frontline several months ago. I was enthralled by the subject matter and decided to get a copy from the local library and read about it myself. What a mistake. The PBS Frontline TV program was so much better than the book. I found Maraniss'  switch from the Viet Nam story to the University of Wisconsin protest story very aggravating; and, as another reader mention, it made for a very disjointed narrative. The juxtapositioning of the two narratives does not work!  I found myself more interested in the war portion of the book than reading about Soglin and his friends embroiled in a protest against Dow Chemical. Frankly, I found this portion of the book to be quite a bore and it almost ruined the book for me. Who cares about college kids and their protesting episodes. It is simply not important.   If you are interested in reading the book, read the Nam portion and skip the protest chapters. Better yet, catch the Frontline episode and skip the book completely. 
 I loved the camera, absolutely loved it.  I was using it one night and it died.  I went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened.  The light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying.  The second time I used it, I just got back from vacation and put it on the charger.  I was able to turn it on to look at the pictures.  As I was looking at the pictures, it just shut off.  I was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose.  I would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine. 
 After a friend told me about this book I checked it out at the library. I never buy a book without first knowing what I am getting. Mr. Godin's book is little more than a rehash of other books on the subject. I guess if  you're a master of hype and self-promotion you can just about flog anything  on the unsuspecting public. A book with a similar title called The  Bootstrapper's Guide to Start-up Entrepreneurship is the one to have in  your personal library 
 It has been well said that, "With how much ease, believe we what we wish."  John G. Jackson and his "American Atheist" comrades exemplify these words with the production of this book.  If anyone were to  take the time to check the references in Mr. Jackson's work, one would find  that a good majority of the authors he cites are either biased against  Christianity or have questionable scholarship (e.g., he depends heavily on  one "scholar" who mainly has honorary degrees, not earned ones).   That in itself speaks volumes about the nature of this book and the  validity of its thesis.    What's even more striking and sad, is that Mr.  Jackson had the audacity to even quote the African Bishop of Hippo, St  Augustine, out of context to "prove" his thesis, "That which  is known as the Christian religion existed among the ancients, and never  did not exist; from the beginnning of the human race until the time when  Christ came in the flesh, at which time the true religion, which already  existed began to be called Christianity" (p. 1, Introduction, 85  edition).  Anyone who would but pick up a good Christian commentary, or  would read the words of Augustine himself in context, would know that the  good Bishop was speaking of how  passages like Gen. 3:15, in the long  undatable past, speaks of Christ in a prophetic sense.  Mr. Jackson  conveniently ignored this fact for the sake of "proving" his  thesis.  Mr. Jackson further argues, again using questionable sources,  that, "The whole Christian Bible was derived from the sacred books of  Egypt" (p. 115).  However, this idea is a non sequitur and post hoc  fallacy which assumes that if something follows something else, that which  followed MUST be derived.  That is not sound reasoning, and it also ignores  other important facts.  Primarily, if the "Christian Bible" is  derived from the "sacred Books of Egypt" (parts of which I have  read), then what explains the fact that the Egyptian books speak of male  AND female deities, while the alleged copy is uncompromisingly  monotheistic?   If the "Christian Bible" were a polytheistic  composition about male and female deities I could understand the point.   But the facts, once again, reveal otherwise.      Mr Jackson goes on in  his book to make overly simplistic and superficial comparisons between  Jesus and Baal and Adonis and Mithra, all the while ignoring recent  archaeology, science, and sociology which militate against his theories.   Whether its the unsubstantiated idea that  the Gospels are of "no  historical value" or other fantastic ideas which go against much  scholarly evidence (readers should see works by F.F. Bruce and Werner  Keller),  Mr. Jackson and the atheists perhaps should stop writing this  kind of material and go into writing fairy tales for children.  Reality  does not seem to be  their cup of tea.   And for those reviewers (like PTAH RA ANUBIS) who like to name-call instead of provide substantive evidence to support the idea that Mr. Jackson is a "well educated man," please try to remember that a) this is supposed to be a BOOK review, NOT a review of the book reviewer, and b) nothing you assert without proof will change the fact that those who think that Mr. Jackson's book has no flaws in either reasoning or scholarship probably are weak in those very areas themselves.  
 I had bought a copy of Harold Evans "The American Century" which I enjoyed mainly for its excellent collection of photographs. After reading reviews complaining that it was too liberal, I decided to have a look at Johnson's book for a different perspective. I have been surprised and saddened by Johnson's tone. Unfortunately his book is not written from a scholarly perspective of investigating the complexity of American history with the purpose of illuminating the truth. All history is biased to some extent, but the language used by Johnson is beyond persuasive- its arrogant. I was hoping to find a reasonable presentation of a conservative perspective of historical events, but this book is written with such narrow mindedness  that it reads more like an extended diatribe.  I find it sad that talented historians sabotage their works with such strongly divisive motives. 
 Note that the movie contains human actors and the majority of the cast are computer animated characters.  I can only assume this was done to save on union fees to actors and make up.  Its a pretty moview with lots of potential.  Unfortunately we don't know why Horus is goign to be killed by the gods, we don't ever know who or what John is or where Jill came from.  You get left with a lot of dead ends which is a bit disappointing considering the potential that was her 
 I hate these new taller books.  Supposedly they are easier to read....actually they are just more money for the publishers.  The reason I buy paperbacks is because they are less expensive.  Then the publishers all got together and decided to shaft the paperback customer by offering some releases only in the taller size for 2 dollars more.  I read 3 books a week, so I can't afford to waste money for a larger book with the same story.  Does it add anything to the book?  No, just more cost.   I refuse to buy this book on principle.  Maybe if my library has the hardcover I will borrow it from them, but I refuse to put more money in the publishers' coffers when they aren't offering this in the normal paperback size.  If it was really for the reader's benefit that they offer the larger size, they would offer both sizes to better serve the consumer. I have seen only the taller book in every store I have visited, there is no regular paperback of this story.  
 yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
 First off, the band sucks. Why don't they and every other member and listener of theiro movement make their music a reality and hang themselves from the balcony of their three story houses and end it. I've had enough of these pu**ies pictures being plasterd all over mtv. All of these bands are little snobby rich kids who are hell bent on convincing the world that them and their f*ggish hair and jeans and make up have it so damn bad. The worse part is record producers are buying into it and squeezing as many singles as they can out of these crappy bands. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!!! 
    The conclusions Gerd Lï¿½demann reaches in his book should lay to rest any questions regarding the historical event of the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, however his conclusions are based more on dubious speculation than historical fact.  The main focus of his argument is his hallucination theory, where the appearances of Jesus to his followers were not of a physical nature but only hallucinations beginning first with guilt ridden, mourning Peter, leading to a chain reaction of appearances to others.  Paul, a Pharisee of some standing in the synagogue, also falls prey in Lï¿½demann's scenario to his overwhelming guilt and this triggered an epiphany not unlike that of the believers. Lï¿½demann's psychoanalysis of both Peter and Paul is baffling coming from someone who purportedly values fact over supposition.  That Peter is in mourning is understandable, that he was guilt ridded to the point of his mind rewriting his reality through hallucination is not supported by any documentation but springs directly from the author's mind.  Paul was proud of his accomplishments as a Pharisee and absolutely nothing prior to his conversion experience hints otherwise.  Because this theory lacks even minimal documentation, Lï¿½demann's hypothesis reeks of wild speculation more than historic inquiry.    Hallucinations are a product of the mind and the mind must have the building blocks for shaping the vision.  Hallucinations do not produce an interpretation of events that is entirely new.  The 2nd Temple Jewish conception was of a general resurrection at the end of time.  Lacking was any notion of individual resurrection.  So the seeds of the "vision" were not in place for the mind to build such an elaborate, life-changing hallucination.  If this were true for Peter, it would hold true in an even stronger sense for Paul.    Hallucinations are by definition individual events.  Lï¿½demann's theory breaks down completely when applied to appearances before a defeated group of people numbering in excess of 500, over a 40-day period, in different locations, all of whom saw the risen Jesus.  Paul writes of Jesus' appearance before 500 people at once and challenges his contemporaries to look up one of them to get the truth of what happened, indicating that many of the 500 were still alive when he wrote his letter.      Lï¿½demann's hallucination theory, couched in a quest for historical accuracy through inquiry, is his attempt to make sense of a seemingly miraculous event and fit it into his strongly held naturalistic worldview.  His worldview has no room for the laws of nature being circumvented and so he must search for the most logical reason for the early believer's convictions that still fits within his worldview.  To do this he discounts the writings of people closest to the event and gives credence to 3rd century writers whom he says wrote of the resurrection as legend.  His main premise is wrong, and, with that in mind, looking back at his manipulations of the texts, his skepticism of the gospel writers' motives and his unwillingness to allow for intervention by a higher power one must reject his thesis and his conclusions. 
 I took Dr. Mount's class at the U. or Arizona, and he's a really smart guy, but the man can't explain anything. It's not just his book either; his lectures are just as cryptic. I went to class thinking I understood the concepts, but then I got totally confused when he lectured. I would try to clarify things with the book, and again, I'd get even more confused. Someone who reviewed this book earlier said that he tends to use 10 words where he should use 1; I couldn't agree more. The figures in this book also need a major overhaul, and he should definitely include more examples of the many complex concepts he talks about. While I have no doubt that there is plenty of useful information in there, getting anything out of it is a chore. I would only recommend this book to someone who already had a strong knowledge of bioinformatics concepts 
 The whining drunk shows his true colors.  Should have been off the air at least 10 years before they finally showed him the door.  What a low-life ... if you're broke, it's your fault.  And, if you lost the Masters vs. Arnie, it's because you didn't play well enough to win 
 Eileen Chandler is getting married and Elizabeth MacPherson is the family representative at the occasion.  A recent college graduate, Elizabeth has agreed to be a bridesmaid for her cousin even though they haven't seen each other in years.  When Elizabeth arrives early, she finds the family propensity for eccentricity hasn't slowed down a bit.  But reconnecting with family takes a dangerous turn when a body is discovered.  When the death is ruled murder, no one in the house is above suspicion.  I'd heard good things about Sharyn's books, so picked this up with much anticipation.  I was very disappointed in it, however.  This is really more a cultural farce then a mystery, but not being from the South, I didn't get it.  The mystery proceeds through fits and starts, with very little several pieces being left dangling at the end.  And the characters were too over the top to be believable.  I've heard that this author's books improve as she progresses, so I might give her another try in the future.  But, based on this book, I'm not going to rush out to do so 
 I was Soooo looking forward to this DVD and I was very, very disappointed. It is just club dancing with belly dancing costumes. Don't waste your money!  Buy Rachel Brice or Shamira or Fat Chance Bellydance !!! 
 This one's going back to the store.  It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat.  If you ask me, my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat.  As for the "massage", it's worthless to me, but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway, I prefer shiatsu.  I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot, so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet 
 A history of the Louisville Slugger bat that omits any mention of Pete Browning, the original "Louisville Slugger" who comissioned Hillerich and Bradsby to manufacture his bats in the 1880's, has to be considered somewhat flawed right off the bat (ouch). A jarring leap from 1870 to 1915, just the period when bats were developing from wagon tongues to modern bats, is unforgiveable. The tales of idiosyncratic bat habits and preferences of major league stars is interesting, but the book utterly fails in its titular premise -- the history -- and is graded accordingly 
 While I would love to read and then recommend this book, Amazon will never get it to me to read. I ordered this in March when it said "8-10 days" and was told, far beyond the estimated ship date, that the book was "delayed". I approved this delay for the updated shipping estimate not once nor twice nor thrice but FOUR times such that the new estimate was sometime in August. Maybe they meant 8-10 months but if they're just not planning on shipping this book, they really should not put 8-10 days on here and take people's money. Good luck getting your copy 
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 I enjoyed reading the book until about halfway through - there are a few instances of animal abuse (particularly about horses) that really bothered me, so I won't finish the rest of it because I don't know what other upsetting things might be contained in the book.  Was the author trying to illustrate the rough, tough life of the Canadian wilderness?  If so, I know I won't do any sightseeing there! If you love animals alot like I do, find something else to read 
 Just like the reviewer before me, the 1st disc of The Batman The Complete Third Season would not play. At first I thought the problem was a fluke and returned it for a replacement but the replacement has the exact same problem too. At this point I'm getting refund, which is a real shame because I was looking forward to the 3rd season. I'll probably wait a few months for this problem to be fixed and try again. Two stars simply because the 1st disc is not functional.    
 This book is about a girl who meets another girl. She travels from Virginia to Michigan in a wagon. She gets lice and she got lice from some little children. I thought the book was not very good because the book wasn't interesting. They could have made it very interesting. I liked how the writer gave full detail on how they made it through the mud and the slush. In the beginning I thought the book would be interesting because the cover and the blurb looked interesting but when I actually read the book it wasn't very good. So I gave it one star. -By Kyra, Second Grad 
 I gotta admit I'm a bit surprised at how generously people are rating this album.  I bought it because people raved about it so much.  My wife and I listened to it on our drive to Indianapolis this weekend and ... we found it very lackluster.  I'm not saying all other reviews here are WRONG, I'm glad they enjoyed it.  However, this album pales in comparison to other works out there.  It simply doesn't measure up to the likes of Todd Barry or Mitch Hedburg.  Not even close.    It is an uncommonly clean album which is nice to see once in a while but I still just can't ignore that it didn't make me laugh much.  It went beyond being clean into JUST PLAIN NON-THREATENING and I wonder if that's what some like about it.  I would love to see more comedians out there who can do "clean" material that still sets people on edge.    As for this album, I simply can't recommend it.  It feels very dated even though it's only from 1997.  (Carlin has stuff from the 70s that feel TIMELESS.  That will never be the case with Regan's album.)  He is not the skilled writer or performer on par with other guys out there.  But that's my experience with the album.  IF it absolutely makes someone else's day brighter, that's great 
 I purchased this video because of others recomendations however I regret having wasted my money. The quality is bad, the script is weak and the entire moving was boring 
 Written by Herge in 1929 (when he was in his early 20s) in episode form for Le Petite Vingtieme, the children's section of a right wing Belgian newspaper, the first volume of Tintin (shown in facsimile form) has some interest mainly for historical reasons. The drawings, for one, are extremely crude. Many eight year olds could have drawn it better. The story's visceral anticommunism is also over the top (though it includes an interesting subplot about the struggle between the soviet regime and the kulaks, which would end tragically in the early 30s in Ukraine with the man made famine or Holodomor). A good scene showing english communists marveled at the achievements of a potemkin soviet factory pokes fun at the naivete of the European communists in regard to the Soviet Union - a naivete that would last decades. The story is generally clumsy, with Tintin having hair rising escapes from sure death in almost every page. This was the only Tintin's story not to be redrawn in colour, and it was out of print for more than 40 years, so clearly Herge was somewhat embarrassed by it. By his next volume, Tintin in Congo, Herge would have developed his trademark clear line style, though the story of that book remained clumsy, not to mention its ardent pro colonialism. I think it was only by his fifth book, The Blue Lotus, that Herge's work rose above the crudity of his early books 
 "The World According to Garp" is on my top 5 list of favorite books of all time.  It's one of those rare books that makes you laugh out loud, but still really feel the emotion of the characters, and the story really sticks with you.  (I made a joke about an Ellen Jamesian just the other day, lol ~ yes, it was a dumb joke that no one else got, but, that's how it goes sometimes :)  I was introduced to the book in college, well after the book and the movie were released, but I had never heard of either one.  I read the book in just a couple of days ~ I couldn't put it down, and I chatted it up with everyone who would listen.  I've re-read it several times since then, and i still think it's terrific.  Naturally, when i found out there was already a movie . . . I was thrilled!  I ordered it right away . . . but i wish i'd never wasted my money.  On it's own, the movie might be alirght.  But when you're invested in the book, when you know the characters, Robin Williams just isn't Garp.  I love Robin Williams, he's a great comedian, that's not a question.  I just think that the casting for this part was way off base.  and if you can't believe the main character, the rest of it's crap.   If you've never read the book, I highly recommend it!! 
 The producers of Lost once said that the reason the show has worked so amazingly well, is because the audience is keen, sharp, and aware of what's going on. They think of ideas that the writers may or may not have thought of on their own, they uncover secrets the writers were trying to hide - in summary, the audience is nowhere near stupid. Nor do they need to be hit on the head with clues or messages to heed what the writers were trying to say. And yet, this is exactly what Endangered Species did. It treated the reader as if he were stupid, as if he wouldn't be able to understand anything past the obvious. As a an avid fan of the show, I was a bit offended that the reader should be treated in such a... stupefying manner. And as a writer, I'm even *more* surprised at the book! The Producers of the show have such a cache of talented writers on their crew, would be able to find better ones if they wished to, and yet somehow they came out with *this*. A completely predictable plotline and a main character one can barely sympathize with. To be fair, the author had a lot to compensate for. The fact that Faith couldn't be part of the main mystery, couldn't have *that* much interaction with the main characters. No original mysteries of her own could be created unless it was kept completely separated from the main plot of the show, and was unimportant to the welfare of the lostaways as a whole. As a whole, it was pretty unentertaining. The only reason I would recommend reading it would be to idle away the time 
 Sean Hannity is a joke, all of these pundits are. WE should dig a hole and push them all in, then throw in a few starving tigers. That would roc 
 I had recently got the cutest little Persian Kitten.  As a new cat owner I purchased this book to get information specific to the breed.  Outside a few pages of breed information, history and pictures, everything else was just general cat information.  I would have expected more on breed care, grooming, and health concerns 
 The movie was very boring. It was a low budget movie with a low budget of excitement. I had to watch this movie four times before I was able to watch the movie in its entirety, because each time I tried I constantly fell asleep 
 I began reading Forever Amber last week (hoping to find a book I might like while I waited for another one to come available at the Library) and from the first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this book.  But I am one of those readers that feels if a book is started then you should finish it.  Upon finishing it I feel cheated.    The book isn't all that bad.  There is a lot of movement, intrigue and history in it.  But I couldn't feel for the characters.  The main character, Amber, was not someone that I would like and even when things went wrong for her, I still felt that way.  I assume that no one is supposed to like her.  And although I didn't like any of the characters in this book, I guess I did feel something for Amber because I felt like she should be with Lord Carlton...up in until the last part of the book.  Then I realized that she shouldn't be with anyone.    The reason for the two stars is because of the ending.  I hated that ending.  I felt totally cheated after reading the whole 700 plus pages and then the book ending so abruptly.  I agree with others who have left reviews here, it seems that the author decided that she either didn't want to write anymore of this book or she ran out of things to write about.    Anyway, it was an okay book to keep me occupied until the book I have been waiting for becomes available but I would never recommend this book to anyone. It's really not worth the time.   I guess you either love the book or you hate it.  And I hated it. 
 This book is designed for mega body builders who want advice on taking lots of supplements in order to bulk up and obtain the type of physique shown on the cover.  It is not very good at explaining how to get maximum nutritional value from food in order to more efficiently burn fat, which is what I was hoping for 
 For many years, I have coordinated a study group for human resource individuals taking the PHR/SPHR certification test. I would not recommend this book.  There are statements and questions in the text that do not go into enough depth to be able to study from this book and pass the certification exam.  One example can be found on page 350, question 8, "Which of the following injuries or illnesses is considered work-related?"  Under OSHA you have "reportable" and "recordable" accidents.  The wording in the question is not complete.  Another example is "disparate impact".  The term is defined with two lines of text within the book, however, no examples or details are given on how to determine if there was disparate impact.  I have heard from other certified individuals in our local area who purchased this book and will not use it as a source of study to pass the PHR/SPHR certification exam 
 I bought the book in the airport and started reading it during the 8 hours flight. I could not believe that such an uninteresting and painfully slow paced novel was a bestseller...I forced myself through the first 30 pages...but that was it. I just left it in the airplane.Maybe later got more interesting,I woudn't know that. But what I read was just plain awafull. Now that I look at the amazon's reviews...they are not so bad......makes me very cautious about reviews in the futur 
 Okay, this book was so absolutely basic that I could have written it.  I was extremely disappointed with how much I didn't learn from this book.  It is 45 pages long, so if you're expecting a good, interesting weekend read--this is not it.  There weren't any detailed case studies.  There weren't any crime scene pictures.  Just basic info on fingerprinting and skull re-construction and a little bit of this-and-that.  Extremely basic.  Recommended for the interested 11 year old, but not for anyone who wants to really learn the nitty-gritty of Forensic Anthropology 
 Ugh. I did not even try to finish the book. It is full of sexual content. Not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature 
 Not the Right Stuff for me. The writing is wordy, attempts to be profound and "educated" at every turn, and fails.  His single most dramatic story, the stuck hatch, is anti-climatic.  His second most dramatic story: too much air getting into the food packets.  There is very little "inside scoop" here, as NASA is portrayed as all glorious, and almost perfect.  Yet we know, and see demonstrated on a regular basis, that the opposite is true.  Find this locally if you can, and browse through it first to see if its the right stuff for you 
 this was the first book of Bell's that I have to say throughly disappointed me. I had read some of his more recents books and loved them and decided to look up his older works. I'm glad I was going backward and not forward or I would have never read the later well written stories. This was NOT a keeper. 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 I admit to not ahveing read the latest edition of this work.  But I have read the previous two and unless there have been changes of substance, which other reviews here suggest has not happened, I will not be wasting my money on the new edition.  The reason is that the authors' work entirely fails to take into account the way in which human ingenuity, stimulated in part by price changes which scarcity should surely bring about, has made, and can be expected to continue to make, adaptations in how resources are used and extracted. Indeed things that were never thought to be resources can be made into resources; deposits that were uneconomic to exploit can become economic if prices rise.  The issues were all set out very clearly by economists when the first great scare broke out in the mid 1970s (when we were told we were going to run out of crucail resources by the year 2000).  I suggest googling two important papers by Yale's William Nordhaus in Brooking Papers for a comprehensive critique of the two previous editions.  This is not to say that resources are infinite, they clearly are not.  But nor is the life of this planet, which is doomed to end when our sun reaches later stages of its life cycle.  The big question is when we run out of renewable resouces and how soon we can replace thenm by renewable ones.  The sort of analysis in the work of the Limits to Growth team ignores so much of the possible adaptations that a well funtioning economic system can be expected to make that it is of no help in answering the big question. 
 After reading the 1st two books in Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and enjoying them immensely, I was more than just a little disappointed in the 3rd volume.   Hobb appears to have burnt out.  He devotes pages and pages to boring pointless journeys, opens a promising theme - Old Blood - and never develops it and his evil king character develops a split personality, alternatly swinging from evil genius to drug addeled dilettante.  I finished the book but it  was so poorly done I had a real hard time not just chucking it part way thru.      
 I really thought the author had a terrific idea in writing a send up of our modern world plotted around a sensational killing. All the elements were there, the media, hollywood, gays, etc. However, he missed the opportunity to paint the characters and the plot in broad satirical brush strokes. Often you could almost take these characters seriously. The dialogue, which is probably typical for Dunne, is too clever by half. This book certainly did not make me want to read any more of his writings 
 The philosophy imbued throughout this book can be summed up as follows: women good, men bad. Men, try putting Smalley's advice into practice and you will drive yourself nuts. Want to be a dancing monkey for your woman? Try doing what he says. Women love this book and recommend it highly because it feeds into every American woman's fantasy that someone else (namely, a man, her husband) will take care of everything and that if something goes wrong, it is the man's fault. Even for *her* happiness! I'm not kidding. How can a *professional* counselor advise something like that? How can one human being ever be responsible completely for another human being's happiness? Do you *really* want to know the scary thing, though? Other reviewers here are right when they say read this book to get great insight into how women think; specifically, American women. American women want the man to do everything, be responsible for everything, take the blame for everything, in a "relationship". Men, if your wife/girlfriend is the type that charges at you saying "We need to talk" or is the type to shove books like this at you, run. Run as fast and as far as you can 
 GET REAL is right!  Practice what you preach 
 This piece of junk will not work in all cigarette lighters. It works in a Nissan Quest but not in a Lexus RX 300?? 
 The experienced businessman/woman should pass on this one.  The book is reminiscent of a required "bubble gum" text in a freshman level business course at a community college.  I only wish the book had more pages so that it would make an even better paperweight 
 The movie itself is fine.  I think Charlten Heston is a fine actor.  However, the quality of the film was "abysmal"  I got ripped for 12.99 plus shipping and handling so that I could show my classes a piece of fine literary material that looked like someone had filmed the film on their video camera.  I could of had better results had I used my camera phone to record this moveie.  On may levels my students were disappointed as was I!  My advice to English teachers everywhere is buy the Marlon Version-at least there is some good acting! I want my money back 
 This book fails on so many fronts that space simply wont allow to cover everything. First off, the author commits the crime of not knowing his audience. He assumes that you know nothing about options and very little about math. He then proceeds to bore you in early chapters with math that isn't even required later on. What's the point!?  Its not until you get half way through the book that you finally get into the real meat. By then, he's makes a huge leap from reviewing how you add 1 + 1 to suddenly assuming that you know 1st year college calculus all in the matter of 1 chapter. In short, he tries to appeal to all, but misses the mark. I am an engineer, I know math, thats why picked up this book!!  Technically, I have many issues. First off, he more or less states that when selling naked puts you shouldn't worry about a move greater than 4 standard deviations because they never happen. Well my friend, although moves such as these do not occur frequently, they do occur often enough that I'd be concerned about using such a stratedgy. I have real life data from the past year to back up my claims. All the author has is theory. Go ask anyone holding a naked put in a pharmacutical company that just got shot down by the FDA what they think of a 4 SD move. They happen.  The author then states throughout the book that these are his claims for how the methods that he presents should work, but he then goes on to say that they should be tested before committing any real money. What the heck!? Why publish a book only to say that you should do your own research to prove his methods!?  I've been waiting for such a book for years! All the other options books out there miss the point of expected value. This book shines on that front. What's the point of winning 90% of your trades if you're a loser at the end of the day. That's the power of expected value. For years I've thought that if I could only come up with a way to accurately calculate expected values on options, then I could turn wall street into my own little casino and retire early! Well, its not that easy!  I've been doing my own research for the past year on all the formulas presented in this book. I've analyzed 1,000's of positions every month on spread sheets with easily downloadable data. Word of warning, dont bet your house on the expected values holding up. Distributions of returns vary from month to month and they also vary depending on the length of time involved. These distribution profiles vary enough to screw up expected values. Distribution profiles also vary greatly depending if you're looking at a large cap or micro cap stock. Do your own research as the author warns and you'll see for yourself. Its been a very frustrating process because in theory the math should work and I should be rich by now, but in practice it doesn't work so well. It just speaks volumes to how difficult it is to make money long term trading options.  I haven't given up the chase yet as I am continuing on with my research, testing and tweaking. This book should be credited for pushing me in the right direction, but its disappointing that the book falls short on its own real world exhaustive research. 
 Wow, I never thought I would've found an R&B album worse than Omarion's debut until I finished listening to this album's samples on Amazon. "Naked", Marques Houston's spohomore effort, is undoubtedly the worst R&B album I have ever heard in a long while.  I apoligize for sounding harsh, but think about it. Where's the talent? Where's the skill? What about the heart & soul? Where's the musical ambition? What about meaningful lyrics & nice beats? Where's his dignity? Where's hist artistic growth? I'm betting he threw all that & so much more out the window along with his tacky clothes. Marques, take this into account...YOU'RE NOT USHER AND YOU NEVER WILL BE, SO STOP TRYING!  I honestly tried really hard to force myself to like his song "All Because Of You", but I just couldn't convince myself to do it. There's not a single song on this entire album that has any true emotional depth. His other singles, "Naked" & "Sex Wit You" are absolutely pathetic attempts at explicit sexuality, with egomaniacle, ridicuously retarded videos to boot. As if the cheesy, sexual come-ons & emotionally devoid ballads were hard enough to bare, you have miserable club tunes to complain about here & there.  Marques Houston is a perfect example of why R&B goes downhills nowadays. Anybody with a slight fraction of a brain would be aware that he has no talent, and relies on his ugly mug & flabby gut to seek the attention of ditsy tween girls worldwide. Skip this album at ALL COSTS (AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY) 
 A rambling, self-important, name-dropping, and pretentious work that I forced myself to finish.  The literary device of focusing on discussions with two fictional students during much of the book was annoying and an easy way to increase page count without requiring serious rigor. I have just started Galbraith's 'Money'; it seems much more robust, though admittedly of a slightly different focus 
 this is very worthwhile territory and you could do worse than read/listen to this book.  i mean no disrespect to etheridge's many fans, but i believe john bly & sam keen, among others, cover this territory with more originality, sophistication and thoughtfulness 
 whatever your view of this book,it is important to make sure you have the book in its entirety. i purchase this book on Amazon. The version i got was missing 32 pages. the pages go from 1-32 then it repeats pages 1-32 then it jumps to page 65. it is missin pages 33-64. make sure yo ask the sellers to verify that their editions don't have this problem 
 I picked up this book because I thought it might make a nice bedtime read for the kids.  They enjoyed "The Animal Farm" a great deal on account mainly of the talking animals.  But I guess making lighthearted tales of whimsy for the children is not good enough for mister fancy writer.  This ones almost downright depressing.  Plus theres sex!  Good thing I read ahead a little bit or I would have to answer a lot of questions thats for sure.  I guess this is how they wrote books back in the 80's but it wont fly in 2006 I tell you what.    Why is there no option for ZERO STARS?!?  Oh well ONE STAR for you then Mr. Orwell 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 This book is tripe.  I was forced to read it for a college class, and am disappointed by the lack of substance in the book.  While it  claims to be about tributes to fallen soldiers in Vietnam, it spends a substantial portion of the time discussing battle monuments of the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, along with an extended discussion of the dedication of the Gettysburg battlegrounds.  It looks too far into many of the objects left, such as the bike tube and nursing pads.  Frankly, I'm ashamed to be associated with the same instution as this woman.  Don't read it if you don't have to 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 In Wayne Koestenbaum's account of Andy Warhol's life and work, everything has been reduced to voyeurism and sex and that is about as redundant as one can get when discussing Warhol's contribution to modern art. The book is a quagmire of self-loathing and narcissism, it's the literary equivalent of being led through a maze by a blind person. Warhol's life story is one of hard work and dreams. This book is way too literal and never get's beyond the authors own personal neurosis to shed any light on one of the 20th centuries most brilliant visual innovators 
 I bought the 2007 making of the Du Stade French Rugby Calendar and the making of the firefighter calendar together and you cannot compare the two.  I suggest you get ALL the French making of Calendars before you waste your time on this.  I am very disappointed in this dvd.  
 After reading the first 15 pages of the book, I was appalled at the numerous amounts of 4-letter words she used. A few 4-letter words are okay to make a point. But Janice couldn't write a book without using every other word as a 4-letter word starting with F and S. I am no saint, but there was too much profanity and not enough of her life as a model. She also put down other models, and called them "mutts", claiming she was the worlds first supermodel. I grew up with Janice and Gia and a few others, and I can tell you she was not the first supermodel. This book was written only to promote her upcoming TV show that airs in June of 2006. Janice needs to clean up most of her potty mouth and admit she has an inferiority complex that is in dire need of mending 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series.  This is the most boring one of them all in my opinion, and, well, how many times can the same story be told?  Bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children, children figure it out, but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything, even when it's pointed out to them.  6,000 times.   
 Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies.  Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way.  The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action.  Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?).  This is going to go down as the "Star Wars Prequel" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love. 
 I have not received this order yet. I am contacting the supplier now 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 I just used this product in a bath. It's supposed to be a Cinnamon smelling bubble bath, shampoo rinse, shower gel. Well first of all, I almost had to swallow my own lungs to smell any cinnamon, this is REALLY weak smelling. (I am a real scent meister too.) I used it as a bubble bath, guess what? The bubbles were gone within minutes. Stick with the Avon bubble bath, it still has bubbles in the tub when you are done! Then I used it as a shampoo. Guess what? It didn't lather! I ended up using the trusty Suave to finish the bath. Very disapointing product! I bought the 32oz. for myself as a Christmas present, can't wait till it's gone 
 Benson's "All Kids are Our Kids" offers a sloppy, often hyperbolic, and superficial approach to the complex issue of how communities can support the healthy development of youth. The book--a  product of The Search Institute's "developmental assets"  franchise--is a pop-psych gumbo of child development knowledge. It's also  badly edited. Readers would be advised to skip this "one smile at a  time" treatise in favor of far more intelligent, perceptive, better  grounded, and socially complex works, and there are many of them 
 It must make some feel very powerful to sit back and rank peoples intelligence and then claim that success or failure depends on that ranking. In a game they designed and created all the rules for, they tell others that their kind do not tend to excel and therefore they are not likely to be successful or rich, as a result. I guess it is true. I too am destined to be poor, dumb or inadequate by your definition of those things, but I continue to ask, what is, "smart?"     30 years ago, I witnessed an experienced well drilling company try in vain to find a water vein on a rural parcel. Two weeks, two wells dug and two wells not adequately producing, within days of being dug. Ready to give up, the landowner approached some locals, who, not really liking to talk openly about the different kinds of intelligence they had encountered in their community, hesitantly referred the landowner to "Mr. Jones," an old black man "down the road."  To make a long story short; using nothing more than his mind, body and the branch of a peach tree, Mr. Jones picked the spot and suggested the depth for a vein that, to this day, still flows abundantly with life-giving h2o. When the well drilling company complied with the landowners request to dig in the spot Mr. Jones had staked out, they refused to discuss Mr. Jones use of the divining rod and stated it was "unscientific" and plainly said to the landowner, "it's your money to waste." I suppose in today's world, Mr. Jones would be defined as "dumb," if he didn't make a million dollars with his God-given craft, but few of his book-smart critics will ever know how rich he really is.   You draw up your IQ tests, that you subject others to, and with all your fancy ways of measuring a brain, you proclaim there is a pattern at work, a bell curve, but, in all truth, you will never know what smart really is, and you will certainly never know wisdom, as you sit back comfortably and observe the rules that make and keep you king, while blind to the very earth creeping up on you. 
 I have over 30 year of woodworking experience building tables, chests etc. I bought this book as it sounded like everything I ever needed to know about box making. The book was a big disappointment. It has lots of colorful pictures on nice glossy thick paper, but lacks the detailed instructions of how to build a box. Normally the Taunton Press (Fine WoodWorking Magazine) has excellent articles, but this book falls short of giving you the 'know how' to build a box. 
 The most surprising aspect of this 2006 thrill ride of a movie is that at ninety minutes, it is almost a half-hour shorter than its 1972 predecessor, a blessing really given that director Wolfgang Peterson seems only interested in filming the action sequences. An inspired choice for the remake, the veteran director has already proven a sharp acumen for providing exceedingly cramped, seafaring adventures with his classic WWII submarine movie, "Das Boot" and the more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong, "The Perfect Storm". The offsetting problem, however, is that Mark Protosevich's trite screenplay abbreviates character development in favor of banal dialogue and stock responses. The net result is that there is little concern for the fate of any of the characters, especially the women who look interchangeable when soaked, no matter how dire the consequences.  Peterson wastes little time, barely fifteen minutes, in setting up the ten key characters for the big tidal wave. From that point, he combines predictably spectacular CGI effects with outsized set pieces to dramatize the familiar journey this group takes to find their way to the hull where they seek safety. The one indisputable improvement over the original is the way Peterson effectively shows the fast elevating water level in a more realistic way, especially in having the characters swim a lot more through the submerged air shafts. Less realistic is the way all the characters appear to swim at Olympian levels in their ability to forego oxygen for lengthy periods. But the set-up gets repetitive, and the only diversion, albeit a minor one, is figuring out which character will be killed next.  As the alpha male, Josh Lucas cuts a reasonable action figure playing the Gene Hackman hero role though a more mercenary type given that his character is a professional gambler. Relegated to second lead, Kurt Russell seems to be inheriting Ernest Borgnine's role but not as a blowhard cop but as the sensitive former mayor of New York (huh?). They argue periodically about what path to take, but that's the only relationship that has any semblance to reality in the film. With no one as colorful as Shelley Winters or Stella Stevens this time, the rest of the actors barely register, including wide-eyed Emmy Rossum playing Russell's conflicted daughter and Jacinda Barrett as the brave mother of a predictably precocious son.  The biggest waste is the normally colorful Richard Dreyfuss cast rather pathetically as a gay, suicidal architect who barely says a word once the action starts. The climax gets quite convoluted in its technicalities, and then it simply ends. There are nine minutes of end credits at the end listing the multitudes who worked on the special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD is strictly for aficionados of this genre of film with several "making of" featurettes and a History Channel documentary which looks at the possibility of such waves wreaking such havoc. Surprisingly, there is little reference to the 1972 inspiration directed by Ronald Neame. And consequntly, there is barely enough to hold interest over the course of two discs. An unmemorable viewing experience overall 
 The premise of the book is terrific.  Unfortunately that is lost in the first few pages.  Many different attacks are planned, and every time one is ready to occur, the US military is there to thwart it.  But of course, that would be boring, so like on the old "Star Trek" TV series, whenever the transporter would get the boys out of a jam, it malfunctioned.  Likewise the US military.  In this book the military is at best a bunch of imbeciles who can't seem to do the simplest task without destroying their own equipment.  It got boring after a while.  The various attacks are serious, but there is no follow-up.  Some of the attacks are enough to bring the country to its knees, but the results are glossed over, or just not mentioned at all.  Sorry Mr. Weber, but a techno-thriller writer has a responsibility to stick to what could happen, and then to wrap up what did happen.  As a side note, the whole book is a set-up for a sequel.  This is another problem I have with this.  I am sick and tired of bad guys making miraculous escapes and then coming back to haunt us in other books.  Maybe Mr. Weber should look up the term "deus ex machina" before he writes his next book 
 How does an 8 page article become a 127 page book?  By the most annoying padding ever attempted in a single book.    The author wanted to sell a book, but had no material.  He never talked to Tiger or Haney.  He used photos from a driving range.  What does he do to fill the pages?  Mention how many majors Tiger has won-at least every chapter.  Tell the reader he was once an editor at Golf Magazine- 15 times.  Plug every book on golf he's ever written. Write a chapter on the grip.  Say it is important- quote everyone who said the grip is important.  Talk about Hogan.  Tell about his book.  Mention Nicklaus.  Never write 6 words when 80 will do.  Here is an example- He doesn't write "Tiger won the 2005 British Open."  Instead he wrote, (this is an actual quote!): "On Sunday, July 17, 2005, Tiger Woods raised his already great game to an even higher level to win the coveted claret jug that is given to the winner of what Americans call the British Open and golf aficianados overseas refer to as the Open Championship. On that beautiful Scottish evening at St. Andrews, the home of golf, Tiger was also crowned the 'champion golfer of the year' as he was given the gold medal presented to all champions."    There is more, but I don't want you to throw up 
 Without a doubt Thomas Wolfe is the worst...I tried reading this book many years ago...it was awful and dull and boring beyond description...anyone who recomends this book must be a dullard. 
 This little volume contains a variety of interesting shawls to knit.  I would recommend against a novice or a beginner knitter from buying this book.  The patterns are more suited to a knitter with more advance skills.  While the shawls are pretty the twists and turns one has to do may discourage the most determined knitter.     
   This is a really cool bubble machine.  We paid $25 at a private toy shop, since Toysrus didn't have anything like this at the time.  My 6 month old loved it and we would put it on occassionally for her.  One day a neighborhood kid was playing with it and the bubble solution overflowed.  We rinsed it out, but didn't realize that the battery compartment was not sealed.  Later when it didn't work and we went to change the batteries, everything was corroded.  We just found another one at Toysrus us, this time for only $10, and we're going to be more careful.  Still a great toy, and I'm sure if it breaks we'll just buy another one, but they really should change the design to protect the batteries 
 Wow what a sleeper... if I had but one day left to live I would spend it reading this... it would seem so much longer!!!   
 Good grief - yet another DVD collection we are not buying because Disney doesn't seem to understand.  We LOVED these series when they were on television but we will not buy something that is slapped together and incomplete.  I hope the folks at Disney get the message eventually.  Same thing applies to their live action feature films.  Disney should release them in widescreen with some extras or not bother.  Too bad because we have all the animated films and would happily buy the live action if the same care was given to the production 
 Recently I read about the revival of "A Chorus Line" on Broadway. I've never seen the Broadway show or any other staging of it, so I thought the movie might give me a sneak peek.  Well, somewhat disappointed here.  I can only assume that the stage version, with its long-running reputation, must be better than this film.  It's not that the film is a total debacle, but it's only mildly pleasant -- and quickly forgettable.  Even songs which I had heard before, like "What I Did For Love", were reduced to barely a mention in the film.  The film seemed to lack any real point.  A bit of a yawner. 
 My school district has recently changed our middle school from homogeneous grouping of classes to heterogeneous based mainly on the  works of Ms. Oakes.  The effects have been disastrous to say the least with large numbers of misplaced and failing lower achievement level students.  After reading "keeping Track" I came to the conclusion that Ms. Oakes has not spent much (if any) time teaching actual K-12 classes.  If you are a teacher in the real world you will probably agree with my assessment.  Her conclusion that we should all just merrily follow the model of cooperative learning (she gives no actual successful examples of how this will really improve learning) and it will fix everything , just reinforced my belief that she basically doesn't know what she is talking about.  Unfortunately many school districts have become followers of her teachings and have radically changed their structures to  heterogeneity.   Of course, Ms. Oakes has made money and these school districts have saved a bundle on this philosophy.  I recommend reading this book if for no other purpose than to open your eyes to the dangers of listening to the purveyors of ignorance that abound in the field of education 
 PC hardware and software changes rapidly, and this book desperately needs updating. No discussions of Pentium 4 class systems and related current memory and operating system updates. Save your $. If you are ready to build, cuy the OReilly "PC Hardware in a Nutshell" book instead 
 The audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep. Not a good thing while drivin 
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 I was required to buy this book when I took a course taught by the author, Jeff Perloff.  This book is the absolute worst micro text I've ever come across.  It's confusing and unorganized much like the author himself.  If you're looking for a good intro micro text, I suggest you look elsewhere.  I highly recommend Nicholson's Microeconomic Theory 
 Continuing in the fashion of Talib fallin' off.  This ish was ultra terrible....................Again............WTF?   One of my favorite emcees, making this ish.  The single with Bilal (sounds like something you catch on your feet) was terrible.  I was truly hurt when I scanned the cd, and there was nothing, and I do mean nothing, to put on the XBOX!!!  Again...........WTF?  After I sold this "train of thought" back, I knew his albums were ugly not beatiful struggles to listen to from here on out.  From the height @ Rawkus to this ish, right down the drain, like the rest of the label.  By the way, what are they doin?  Why this album sucks: 1)  Talib fell da f*ck off 2)  It's wack 3)  Him and DJ Quik don't mix, and that song was on Soundboming 3 4)  Reusing a song from compilation disk 5)  Commercial 6)  Coaster material 7)  Opposite of album title 8)  Beats 9)  Lyrics 10)  Ultra wack as @#$%*&^ in all languages  Bottom Line:  Talib should have taken that cheap muthaph*cka and wiped his @$$ wit it FO, REAL!!!!!!!!!!   Peace!!!!!!!!  P.S.  Amazon won't let me rate it 0 stars 
 The conversations and actions of the characters were totally unbelievable. I had to force myself to finish the book 
 This book is very poor to be used for A+. The flow of sentense in the main text book is not organized well. The author puts too much verbose, unnecessary, words to explain objects; what is that light-minded, lazy description about USB? As well, the book is not technically witten; it even does not differenciate Low, Full, and High speed mode of USB. What is worse is that the optional book "Practice Questions" has full of wrong answer keys as you can see in the other customer reviews. I am very discouraged reading this book because of errors the book contains. The next time the author edits the A+ book, I wish him and co-workers to re-read the contents several times with experts and technical writers 
 The 33 1/3 series is a gift and when I saw they were writing a book on one of my all time favorite recordings, OK Computer, I couldn't have been happier.    The book in a word however, blows.  Much of the book is dedicated to some aimless theories about the place of LP records and cds in the broad landscape of musicology.  Considering how painfully short this book is to begin with, it seems like a perfect waste of space - filler for an academic journal.  When the author does get around to the actual work of Radiohead, he almost exclusively refers to the musical score and references much of their work as only "sound effects."  While his analysis of the notes on the page is at times compelling, he fails miserably to describe "musical" and "technical" choices not accounted for in the score and their impact on the recording.  While other books in series may at times be criticized for being too journalistic, and speculating at the intent of the musicians, here the author goes to far in the other direction -- there isn't even a mention of the unique recording space this album was crafted in, not to mention any speculation as to the effect it might have had.  Nigel Godrich the producer (along with the band) and engineer is reduced merely a mention, any notion of sculpting sound with studio tools is non-existent.   Considering the direction the band has pursued after this record, highly electronic and diffuse by western musical standards, this book serves little interesting purpose, but perhaps to serve as a footnote in a more comprehensive book by an author who can synthesize the roll of the composer with the concept of a recording as piece of art that is constructed with a different set of skills than the score it maybe also represented by.  In short, don't bother buying this book if you want to read anything about Radiohead the band or how they create music.  This one will have little interest to anyone but musicology students and most of them will find it painfully incomplete as well. 
 "Two Virgins" lives up to its title--it sounds like it was created by someone with absolutely no musical experience at all. While I'm a big fan of Lennon's Beatles and post-Beatles solo albums (even the weakest Lennon album "Sometime in New York City" has its minor moments), I found this completely unlistenable and a waste of 30 minutes of my time.   Is "Two Virgins" misunderstood? If it is it's because it's in an incomphrensible musical langauge. The cover was the only thing this album was notable for--a nude portrait of a couple who had found love. It created controversy (EMI didn't want to distribute it). As avant-garde its too simplistic as music it's a disaster. Avoid unless you must have everything (including every fart, belch and toe nail trimming) from Lennon 
 First of all, I have to give this collection at least 2 stars because it is RATT after all and there are some great tunes here. But in general, the Essentials series sucks. They try to put the big over-played radio tunes and leave out killer album cuts and fan favourites. They only have two tracks from Dancing Unvercover, my favourite Ratt release. The material from Detonator is the slow ballad crap and not the really high energy stuff. What a disappointment. Do yourself a favor and buy Dancing Undercover. If you still don't like Ratt after listening to that album, you never will 
 I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously.  For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described.  Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:  http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.ht 
 I purchased more than 100 Jazz recordings last week alone. Including Armstong, Goodman, Art Blakey, Coltrane, Miles Davis, Chet Baker, Lee Morgan, Clifford Brown, Dave Brubeck, Branford Marsalis, Joshua Redman, etc., etc., etc. I even purchased other Wynton Marsalis recordings. Of all of them, I could not help but return this to the store from which I bought it. Normally, they don't take things back but because I purchase so many CD's from them as well as Amazon, they agreed. Sorry, this is boring, with emphasis on the boring. Regardless of whatever awards Wynton has won as a result of this work. I am into results, not polls or awards. There were also polls that said Clinton had a 68% approval ratings. From who? Wyonton Marsalis is a great composer/musician but this one does not warrant the praise 
 This book was...interesting. I didn't really think this was a great book, but it's an easy read. Take a day or less to read it. The book itself didn't really strike me as a good. I think this story is more for kids from kindergarten to around 3rd grade [at most]. I got bored with it quickly [I mean, I don't see why people would want to read about ther adventures of a stick with an nut head!]. This is just my opinion though 
 The basis for questioning the accuracy of Joan of Arc's condemnation trial transcript has not been its date of creation, but the myriad ways in which the trial was rigged.  Joan of Arc was a famous political prisoner.  Her trial was funded by the government she had warred against and numerous court officials worked under compulsion, some even under death threats.  Court clerks later testified under oath that portions of the official transcript were altered.  This document did not stand the test of time.  A quarter century later the verdict was overturned.  While this remains an important historical source, it lacks the weight that court records normally carry.  Serious scholars will prefer the Latin original.  English translations are already available for free on the Internet.  A new translation that makes suspect claims for the document's value is not what the English speaking public needs.  I wish Professor Hobbins well and hope he follows up with a translation of Joan of Arc's retrial transcript.  A complete and adequate version has never been readily available in English 
 Tiresome, repetitive sexual descriptions, no character development, unexplained events, no plot, very little humor.  Ten years ago, Hamilton was doing interesting work, exploring some moral issues, having some character development, and humor.  Now both the Blake and Gentry series are predicable and sex obsessed 
 Ackroyd is a bad scholar, a bad thinker and a bad stylist.  He should never have attempted a biography of Shakespeare.  The best and kindest thing one can do to this rubbish is not read it 
 I am a big Popper fan, but this book is out-of-date, although it contains valuable information.  Popper's arguments for indeterminism are based on the body-mind distinction: 'physicalism (or the philosophy of the identity of mind and body) is absurd.' G. Edelman explains clearly in his brilliant book 'Bright Air, Brilliant Fire' that mind is a matter of matter. Consciousness is an emerging characteristic of life after a long evolution. Popper's system of 3 Worlds is also flawed (World 1: physical world - brain physiology; World 2: subjective thought - human consciousness; World 3: objective thought - theories), because World 1 and 2 are the same.  His arguments against philosophical and scientific determinism are powerful, but scientifically speaking Laplace's demon is a joke. As Steven Hawking explains in John Boslough's 'Steven Hawking's Universe': 'Even if we do achieve a complete unified theory, we shall not be able to make detailed predictions in any but the simplest situations.' Predictions will be limited to the extreme and determinism will be non-existant in brain physiology (Mozart's G minor symphony could not have been predicted). Indeterminism will be all the more true in the social sciences (historicism). Indeterminism is a cardinal characteristic of matter: all singular events in this world are unique, free.  It is very strange that some of the brightest scientific minds (Einstein, Schroedinger) were staunch defenders of determinism (see Popper's discussions with Einstein on p. 90-92). The fact that Einstein changed his mind at the end of his life is not confirmed in M. Jammer's book 'Einstein and Religion'.  On the other hand, Popper's remark on the arrow of time is to-the-point: 'As to the arrow of time, it is in my opinion a mistake to make the second law of thermodynamics responsible for its direction. Even a non-thermodynamic process, such as the propagation of a wave from a centre, is in fact irreversible.'  Very important is note 3 on p. 43. J. von Neumann, H.H. Goldstine: 'a mathematical formulation necessarily represents only a (more or less explicit) theory of some phase (or aspect) of reality, not reality itself.'  I recommend this book only for Popper fans 
 I was very disspointed with this book. The author is very high on his scientific background and spends most of the book simply defining the aspects of foods and telling you why other diets don't work.  When it comes to his actual recipies, there is no shopping list to go with them and I didn't even make it past the first few listed as they sounded disgusting! Asparagus Crepes?  Gross! Seriously, that's the first recipie in the book, and you have to go through 110 pages of mostly nonsense to get to that point. Also most (if not all) of the recipies are for 2 servings - why would a diet book encourage you to make too much food?  Very strange.   Definitely not recommended if what you are looking for is a book to help you shop and eat better immediately. I don't know if the diet actually works because it doesn't give you enough information to get started. If you want to read about how great the author thinks he is then this your book, but you must have to actually meet him in person if you want to understand this diet. 
 When I first learned about this book I was so excited.  I had just started gripping on feature films and I thought I would be able to pick up some tips.  Sadly, while Mr. Uva has been Key Gripping for years, he fails to  provide true insight.   While this book is great for people who have never  worked with film equipment, at 30 clams, I regret the purchase. If you have  gripped before, I would pass on this one 
   Ok..take that back...it does have all the answers in the back of the book, that is worth one star.  I would recommend many supplements to help you learn the steps fully.  Very confusing text, nothing really explained well.  A VERY solid knowledge of calculus is required...get out and study all of Cal 1 and Cal 2 again to refresh 
 The novel was a badly-researched and badly-written third-rate airport thriller.  This illustrated edition is an expensive and attractive badly-researched and badly-written third-rate airport thriller.   For tru-fans only 
 I have to admit that I didn't like this movie very much. It shows Tom Cruise's domestic circumstances but this subplot doesn't seem to be woven well with the rest of the movie. 
 I was very disappointed by the book.I wanted an explanation for Israels continuing occupation of Palestinian lands but got only apologistic rhetoric from this obvious pro zionist.Much of his writing I thought quite racist and certainly biased 
 This is not one of Kellerman's best books.  I was so looking forward to the book coming out, but I was sadly disappointed with it.   The premise of the story was fine, Dr. Alex Delaware receives a scrapbook in the mail containing murder scene photos. These photos bring back haunting memories to Delawares friend, Milo Sturgis, who is a homicide detective.  As a matter of fact, these photos look familiar.  This was a great way to start the story, and I was hooked, but soon it all became confusing with too many characters and in a effort to keep the identity of the killer secret til the end of the book, the plot got fuzzy.  I usually love his books, but he missed the mark on this one.   If you are reading Kellerman for the first time, don't get this one.  If you are a returning fan, skip this one and use the 8 bucks for something better 
 I have to admit, I have forced myself to listen to Michael Weiner's abortion of a talkshow more than once.In a way it's almost humorous, until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously, they view him as a deep political thinker. He is not.He is an ignorant, homophobic, sexist, racist little subhuman troll. An insult to true, honest-to-God old-fashioned American conservatism. William F. Buckley Jr he ain't. What this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual. One would find more insightful comments at your state's mental hospital, or by a survey of several of your town's homeless population. I can't wait for the day when Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly AND their counterparts on the left Moore, Franken, Janeane Garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve. Or even better, we could get NASA to get cracking on building the first solar lander, and have them put these windbags on it. The average IQ of the nation would increase, and perhaps we would then be able to listen to REAL political discourse, instead of a bunch of ignorant, partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another. 
 I, Jedi is amazing. Amazingly BORING!   You've got a first person narrator, which in the all-action-little-depth conceit of the SW novels is a Really Bad Idea. And this isn't even a deep Star Wars charecter. He loves his wife, he tries hard at school, he Never Ever does something he knows is wrong.   The plot slouches along, with narrator-Jedi on a quest to find his wife who doesn't even really get kidnapped proper, just sorta misplaced and sleepy. He then farts around the Jedi Academy for a while (despite not being in the Jedi Academy books) because: hey! wouldn't it be easier to find her if I was a Jedi? This is the central conflict of the novel, a challenge that should be familiar to anyone who played Super Mario Brothers.    Eventually, he goes off to find whatever it was he was looking for, and discovers a whole new plot conflict about 150 pages from the end that has no relationship with the previous anything. So, basicly you're slugging through a miserable 400-page diary to get to an OK novella, which then ends abruptly. After all the excess chaff you put up with, it doesn't even tie up loose ends or explore the few interesting ideas introduced in the last 20 pages.  I honestly don't remember if he saved the princess, but I assume he did, because if he didn't... that would be awesome. In the end, it didn't really matter. This was sooooo bad. I can't believe how bad it was. So BAD! BAAAAD!  
 In february 28 I purchased this remote control,mainly for his feature that the keys glows in the dark.Well thats not true! In the add for this product clearly says that, even in the Sony"s Web page also appear that information.I read 3 times the manual instruction booklet and...nothing about it.!What is this? It is a lie? or a last time chages in the specifications? I am very  dissapointing 
 I started reading "Mona Lisa Awakening" by Sunny, ready to dive into another "not so normal" erotic/romance book. About a quarter into it I had to pause for a moment, had I read this before? I have been known to reserve the same book twice from the library, then begin to read it only to realize my mistake, so I checked my "already read" list, and nope, so why was it so familiar? A woman, young and beautiful, suddenly finds herself to be royal blood thrust into an unusual "world within a world", she is a queen by birth and she has unusual powers that are stronger than any of her kind The "children of the moon" the "Monere" who came to earth 4000 years ago and are hiding amongst us, our vampire/werewolf legends heck maybe even our obsession with reality TV might have come from them. This Mona Lisa, whose own mother gave her up because she was a Halfling, must now prove herself among her peers who so happen to hate her tainted blood. She gets to pick out strong, powerful, virile men to accompany her, protect her and have lots and lots of sex with her. Other jealous queens try to kill her, she finds out she has a brother, demons kidnap her and try to rape her, and throughout she learns to control her powers of healing, and seeing in the dark and changing into a tiger. When she beds these men, she shares her powers, and heals them. Frankly I found it gross that she is making whoopee with some dude who is a) rotting away from a stomach wound b) burnt horribly and c) torn in half Yuck, Yuck, and double yuck. It was so hard for me to believe that a 21 year old ER Nurse, hadn't ever used a cell phone, or doesn't know how to use a computer!!   Whatever this book claims, believe me you HAVE read it all before. It's called the "merry gentry" series and it's written by Laurell K. Hamilton. It might not be word for word, but it's darn close. Between the group sex, evil queens, and abnormally large endowed men Laurell Hamilton better call her lawyer quick. Seriously, you can admire another author's work but you should never ever rip them off. I love Stephen King, you don't see me writing a book about a town called "Talems Plot" where some creepy dude moves into town, opens a shop and vampires eventually take over, oh wait not vampires ...blood suckers or even better... vampyres!.  Sunny isn't a bad writer, its palatable and understandable, but it's a simpler echo of a great series and that's unforgivable. She even gets a beloved American commercial phrase wrong. In quoting Tony the Tiger, she says "that's great" when its "they're great" I know that's nitpicky, but cmon........my final word is don't buy this, get it from the library if you must and compare and contrast on your own, if you have never read Hamilton please read hers first and you will nod your head with compliance to my  (and in reading reviews many many others) comparisons.   
 I bought the Explorist which I am generally happy with, but this software is lousy and there is no product support for it on the website.  The version I have 2.0 has not been updated to work well with the Explorist, and the 64MB limitation is a pain when you have a 512MB SD card.  In general, the routing works but the interface is nowhere near as good as Streets and Trips 
 First, before I begin, I must say that Heinlein is one of my favorite authors. He is a science fiction grandmaster, and deserves the honor. He  wrote excellent works such as Starship Troopers, The puppet masters, and my  personal favorite: Jobe, a comedy of justice. However, this book is simply  bad!  The first story, Gulf, tells about a person (a spy) who discovers he  is a part of an advance subrace of human. The story has some interesting  ideas, and is actually quite good. The second story, Elsewhen, tells about  a group of people that can travel between various realities. It has  interesting ideas, however it is written *SO* badly, *SO* badly, the level  of writing is like a 7th grader. The characters aren't even two  dimensional... Maybe one dimensional, barely. The third story, Legacy,  tells about a scientists which try to develop uncharted parts of the brain,  because they believe it holds the key to superhuman abilities. Again, this  is horribly written, after reading half the story I realized I feel as if  I'm watching "Mystery Science Theatre 3000". It was just so  similar. I couldn't finish the story, it was that stupid. The fourth and  last story, Jerry was a man, tells about a future where it's possible to  create (almost) any kind of creature, with genetic engineering. I liked  this story, it had good ideas, and was short - and good. Overall, I think  this book is not worth it. I saw that all of these stories were written in  the 40s-50s, so they might actually be some of Heinlein's earliest work..  maybe that's why he doesn't shine in them. If you're really a fan, you can  get this book, but as a collection of stories it's simply bad. The 2 good  stories just aren't worth buying the entire book.  One last thing, if you  never read any other Heinlein book - go get one! He is one of the finest  science fiction writers, and one lousy book can't change that 
 I cannot bring myself to cook anything from these books.  The recipes include too much fat.  Recipes that include large amounts of butter, cream, cheese and creamed commercial soups are both too rich and salty.  I'll bet they taste wonderful, however. Creating such fattening dishes is irresponsible.  Also I resent having to use Paula's prepared mixes as part of her ingredients, eventhough she does offer the recipes to create substitutions for them.  I have watched the TV cooking programs and enjoyed them.  The food she cooks has always looked delicious though rich.  Paula's accent is lovely to listen to, and her presentation is beautiful.  Photos of the finished dishes would have been extremely welcomed.  Also, the quality of book paper was poor.  I really should simply return the books and might do that.  Only 1 star from me, if that.  Disappointed.  
 This is a very biased, uninformative book.  The research views are very narrow and the author treats the readers like children, as though the readers are not capable of drawing their own conclusions.  I'm extremely disappointed with this book!  I do NOT recommend this book, at all.  I've found books such as "Mind Boosters" far more informative and enlightening 
 I bought this book with a lot of hope and enthusiasm but unfortunately found that the recommended exercises were not right for me. In fact they hurt and made my back worse. I did find a therapist who gave me massages and exercises which worked and I'm now without any pain 
 OK, I know people will disagree with me, but this book became unbearable somewhere in the middle & I just gave up by the time I was 3/4's done.  Historical mysteries are pretty tiresome if they are not extremely well-written & there are a few very good ones in here, but they drown in the mediocrity of the rest of the stories.  How many various time periods can you honestly claim to have believable detectives working when oftentimes the culture & history of the period would make it completely impossible for anyone to be a Holmes-like figure?  It's just too hard to suspend my disbelief long enough to get into the stories & most of them are so simplistic & easy to solve that you can turn to the end to confirm your guess & then move on to the next story.  If you're into this genre, go for it, but otherwise, pace out the stories over a long period of time to avoid burnout & try not to let the crummy ones ruin the good ones for you 
 James Glassman should apologize for his stupidity, his arrogance, and this book, which lured in a whole lot of amateur investors just as the stock market was about to go bust.  
 It can indeed be extremely stressful for a Japanese speaking foreigner working at a Japanese company in Japan. I say this from direct personal experience. But my impression is that the author's only skill was the ability to speak Japanese. She had no basic office skills e.g. she was unable to perform simple calculations. And she had neither business training nor business experience. Amelie Nouthomb's degree was in philology not business or economics or finance. This being the case she was unqualified to perform any complex tasks. Little wonder that her brief experience of working in Japan was such a disaster. 
 You want me to actually write a review for this disaster? You might laugh if your IQ falls shy of 85, anything over that will make you realize what a dull, retarded, sorry excuse for a movie this is 
 Just pure crap.  The author tries to persuade you (using a college freshman's understanding of psychology and philosophy) that Carl Sagan was an egomaniacal tyrant who only knew how to use people because he wanted to impress his demanding mother.  Skip this and read the better written and balanced biography by a real science writer, William Poundstone, who knows how to research and didn't just rely on the opinions of Carl Sagan's rivals and ex-wifes to paint a more complete picture of a great scientist and humanist.  The definite biography on Carl Sagan:  Carl Sagan: A Life in the Cosmos by William Poundston 
 AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber.   Anyway, better luck next time Angus & Co.  Stiff Upper Lip ~ AC/DC : 2 stars  
 I can't believe I just spent over an hour of my life listening to ten (TEN!!) different mixes of this not too remarkable dance hit. By the third version, my brain turned to jelly. By the fifth, I needed a drink. By the final re-mixed version, my hangover already started to set in. This e.p. is for DJ's and masochists only. 			- Tom Rya 
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 I gave this one one star, but it might rate two. If you're looking for a chatty, rambling, disorganized treatise on gender and biology, and think that you can really learn something valuable about humans from the animal kingdom, then this book is for you.  I bought this book because I thought it was going to be about the brain.  It's more about gender behavior.  You're left to draw you own concllusions about what's going on in the brain.  There's gotta be a better book than this 
 It's not quite fair to describe Rosenbaum's latest book as a novel.  It actually reads much more like an essay.  This is a message book...Rosenbaum has a rather heavy-handed message that he is bent on delivering.  There is a tremendous lack of depth or realness in the characters and the plot is overly contrived and uninvolving.  The reason is simply that the characters are only devices Rosenbaum uses to further communicate his message.  Indeed, the characters are anything but fully fleshed out (no pun intended)...they as well as everything about this book exists for the sole purpose of preaching.  Very uninvolving.  The message itself is educational and somewhat interesting, but buyer beware - this is an overlong essay...not a novel 
 Congratulations to me! It's taken 10 years since this garbage was published for me to get around to reading it; ironically it was given to me as a bad joke of a Christmas gift from one of my what?adult piano students! It is mis-titled: it should be called Not Learning Piano for Dummies. Adams writes as an over-indulged, silly, overpaid NPR yuppie whose idea of accomplishing an artistic, creative and disciplined skill such as the fine art of music is totally unrealistic, childish and basically repulsive and insulting to the act of learning. His then-new  wonderful Steinway I hope has been given by now to a music student with respect for the theory and technique and structure of music, all of which can be learned and yes, even performed well, by students young and especially as adults WITH PRACTICE, WITH A DECENT TEACHER and by not trying to outsmart-a** what has proven to be gloriously true for centuries: that the beauty of music must be mastered carefully, with dedication and with patience.  His attitude - buy a good piano and ignore it for a ludicrously stupid computerized program which refuses the student the basics, reading and counting, let alone the phrasing of music - exemplifies the dumbing down of American culture. Frankly, those of who DO make our living at the piano DO NOT WELCOME FOOLS such as himself. AARGH!(I resent giving it even the 1-star, it was required to have this review printed. 
 I never had a problem with this radio until today. It has been exactly two years since I bought the delphi boom box. My display unit on the CD part of the boom box has gone kaput. The radio still works, but I cannot see what radio station I have on and I cannot see the song number on the CDs. I called delphi tech support and was told that since I am passed my one-year warranty, I am out of luck. They can do nothing for me. They told me it would be cheaper to buy a new one because to fix it would probably cost me about $80 an hour. I can probably live without the display unit, but I hope this doesn't mean that more things with this radio will start to go wrong. Be prepared to possibly have to upgrade after two years with this one.   
 This is one of the worst books I've EVER read.  Or almost read.  I've only gotten through 50 pages so far, but there's NO WAY I will be able to read ANY MORE.  Chuck Klosterman can't write about anything but himself, and let me tell ya...he's not interesting AT ALL.  AND some of his information regarding historical events in rock history have already been misinformed in the first 50 pages...so don't dare read this book with ANY intention on learning ANYTHING about rock music history.  I HATE THIS BOOK.  I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER BOUGHT IT.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I disagree with the positive reviewers completely.  I am a casual Astrud listener who unfortunately bought based on their reviews, and was let down.  I just wanted Astrud's lovely voice with simple accompaniment.  What I got  was an organ drowning out her voice.  I have since bought the Silver  Collection, which I think will suit better most people wanting a casual  listening experience where the emphasis is truly on her lovely, simple  voice 
 Ok. I am sure the majority of you are more Jamie Oliver fans than wanting to buy his book for the cooking. I really liked watching Jamie in the Naked Chef days...early ones especially so I was given this book from a friend of mine as a pressie. It was very entertaining and I guess his passion just shines through in his books and Naked chef etc... however as lame as it may sound I only recently made a couple of recipes including the 'kinda portuguese custard pie' which I know should taste amazing. I bought the best quality ingredients and even 2 vanilla pods from Sainsburys which cost me 3.99. The custard was way undersweet. Jamie suggested a medium heat to cook the custard and I even put it slightly less because my dad is a head chef and he told me it would turn into scrambled egg consistency and it did. He also said to cut the pastry 1 inch thick and I had a feeling that this would be too thin and indeed it was. I had spent one whole hour just sorting out the pastry only to end up watching it fall to pieces in the oven cos it was melting....I could go on forever but Jamie might be a good cook but do not confuse this with Gordon Ramsey standard of cooking. 
 Not what I was expecting. Very hard to read as it was written back in the dark ages and the english used is tough 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 Dont bother buying this book it,s far too technical for anyone except a pro with a flash machine shop 100 parts (some tiny) heaps of springs and no ma 
 I studied this book thoroughly and then attempted to make a pair of plain pants that FIT.  I've been sewing for 40 years.  I did not get a pair to fit, and after 6 muslins, bought PANTS FOR EVERY BODY.  The problem was, I have specific, difficult fitting issues - flat, low seat, small waist, big thighs - which this book does not cover.  So, if all you need to do is add width or length, this book is probably ok.  It sounded great in theory - slide, mark, trace - but in reality I could not even come close to a good fit in pants 
 Works great for partitioning a hard drive but when it comes to adding another operating system. I've been pulling out my hair. The directions are vague and the customer service stinks. Everything is done with email and if you want to talk to someone it will cost you 29.99 for a one time occurance. Check it out at www.acronis.com . Look around before you buy. If I would have I would have never had bought this product. 
 The darn thing broke almost immediately.  When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands!  What a flimsy piece of crap.  I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again 
 My problem was that these books were missing chunks of pages!  We didn't notice it until book 4 of 6, but 80+ pages were gone!  Now, Amazon was great about replacing the set adn paying for me to return the messed-up set.  This is just a warning to check your boxed set when it gets in for missing chunks of pages!  Of course, the Harry Potter series is great, adn we love having them in paperback 
 I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!    I have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing.  I would suggest skipping this one and purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man himself.  
 I'm not an ardent supporter of the present government in Iran, but I have an issue with the cover of this book and its title: "We Are Iran, Today Real Iranians." If the people who are depicted on the cover of this book are Iran, then where are the rest of the population who do not live in the tony sections of northern Tehran, do not drink cappuccino and do not look so hip? What is this book trying to say: that Iranians actually look and act like Westerners; that they are actually a "civilized" nation and what's happening in Iran has nothing to do with the "real" Iran? That ordinary, everyday women of Iran who do not sip cappuccino, dress in traditional customs are not Iran? I don't think so. Iran is much more than these people. The people on the cover belong to La-la land 
 I generally like Elmore Leonard, this is the twelfth book of his I've read, ranging from his Detroit crime capers, to his L.A.-set Chili Palmer stuff, to some of his Westerns. Other than the terrible "Be Cool", this is probably my least favorite of his books so far. Set in the years between the end of World War I and 1934, the story follows Carlos "Carl" Webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot U.S. Marshall. The story takes place in the dusty Midwest, mainly around Tulsa and Oklahoma City, as Carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves.  Carl is a somewhat vain, cocky lawman, with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers. His main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man, a no account young man who has everything he needs, but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into Carl's path. Mixed into this are kinds of period details, from prohibition to Will Rogers shows to Klansmen vigilantes to "True Detective" writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde Barrow.   Despite all this background detail, the story itself failed to engage me. There are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize Leonard's best work. There's a good guy, a bad guy, and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic. In fact, about halfway through the book I realized that the "real story" wasn't going to kick in -- I was in it! And unlike many Leonard books, the supporting cast of characters isn't particularly memorable. Even Leonard's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing, subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech. Ultimately, one gets the feeling that Leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period, and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story. That said, the Depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story, given the time and place. All in all, unless you're really really into the whole '30s gangster thing, not worth the time. 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 We made the mistake of buying this ABRIDGED version of The Hundred Days, not noticing the FINE PRINT. The reader was very good, but the material truncated, choppy, and not "up to snuff." If you are a devoted fan of the Aubrey-Maturin stories, hurry up and read, yes, read the book. There's not a moment to lose 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I bought this sandbox for my 2 1/2 year old son, and he loves playing in the sand with it.  However, I am taking it back to the store & exchanging it for the Naturally Playful sandbox (which I was originally going to purchase, but got this one instead to save $10 - mistake).  As soon as I put the lid on it caved in the middle (of course, I already had sand in it).  Also, the lid just seems to lay on the top, and could be easily blown off.  I'm sure it won't last through many sunny days or storms so it will be going back 
 Please disregard this joke -- I mean book. It's not hard to distort sources to fit your own agenda... anyone can negatively portray any religion or individual using historical sources. 
 This book is so beautiful on the outside it's a pity that the words are so incredibly hurtful and wrong.  The story is about a fish who is covered with beautiful scales.  Another fish comes up and asks to be given one of the scales and the beautiful fish says no, after which none of the other fish will play with it.  The fish is advised by someone "wise" to give away its beautiful scales so that the other fish will like it.  It follows that advise and gives every other fish a scale so that by the end of the book the page is filled with a bunch of pathetic looking fish that all have one shiny scale and everyone is supposedly happy.  For me this is a terrible moral!  It's wrong to be prettier or smarter or more talented in some way?  You should try to make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won't be jealous?  It's OK to demand other people give you things that you covet?  Yuk! 
 This book deserves no stars.   PLEASE stop buying and promoting this rotten book! This is a book about a rotten, selfish self-centered male who takes everything including the life of the female tree. Even at the end when he chops her down to sit on her as an old man, he's still unsatisifed and has a big scowl on his face!  The female tree gives and gives and gives, and the male (from boy to old man) just takes and takes and takes and is never satisified, happy or thankful.  What kind of story is that?  This is truly a rotten story. Don't buy it! Don't give this to your children! 
 One could right an honest right-wing history, I suppose, by sticking to the facts.  Paul Johnson's propaganda is simply lying.  As just one instance of this, Paul Johnson assures the reader that President Johnson was reluctant to escalate the Vietnam War.  He further assures us:  "There is no evidence, as was later alleged, that the incident was contrived, to get America deeper into the war."   And further:  "But congress, by an overwhelming majority, passed . . . the "Tonkin Gulf Resolution' authoring the President to take vigorous measure to protect US forces."  One would think that if he going to make such a claim that he should at least explain why the Pentagon Papers so explicitly state that the official account of the Tonkin Gulf attack was a deliberate deception.  In the October HARPER'S article, "The Next War," Daniel Ellsberg claims to have had drawerfuls of critical working papers, memos, estimates, and detailed escalation options revealing the evolving plans of the Johnson Administration for a wider war, expected to commence soon after the election."  Though far more inclined to trust Ellsberg than Johnson, either Paul or Lyndon, I admittedly have no way of knowing who is telling the truth, but I have not heard that the Pentagon Papers were not genuine.      When Johnson is not simply lying, he uses facts to support a viewpoint which he himself must know to not be true.  "Support for intensifying the war was always greatest among the under thirty-fives," (at least prior to November 1968, "by which time the decision to get out had already been taken)."  (By whom)?  Considering that the young had been nursed on heroic World War II movies, trained in blind "patriotism" and educated in such a manner as to preclude questioning governmental authority, what else was to be expected?  Once we woke up to what had been done to us, we, the American People, most definitely lost our stomach for the war.  With "historians" like Paul Johnson, it is not surprising that another generation has been duped.   (Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA BATTLES THE BEELZEBUBIAN BEASTS OF THE BIBLE)  
 The last time Kurupt was in dire straits, Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha surfaced as a brilliant, vengeful album packed with melodic Fred Wreck and Dr. Dre production, and Young Gotti's verbal piss and vinegar. Four years later, Kurupt's stranded on Death Row, and his rare interviews have alluded to another chapter of inner-turmoil. This album has been toted and pushed back for three of those years. As Kurupt's future seems brighter through a Dogg Pound reunion, the solo - Against Tha Grain (Death Row) arrives unexpected, unannounced, and clearly under-dressed for Hip-Hop's better MCs in 2005.   "Deep Dishes" reveals a new bottom in Kurupt's lyrics. "You ain't got weapons of mass destruction on you / And I'm gonna make sure you leak like barrels of oil," is not only a awkward rhyme, but one of many analogies to terrorism and the Holocaust for street-success. The attitude is polarized between death-threatening lyrics of pained animosity ("Speak On It" and "Jealousy") to olive-branch offerings of peace, "Tha Past." Perhaps this reveals either Kurupt's own uncertainty of his friends, or a poorly thought-out compilation from four years of masters. Whichever, Kurupt's sincerity on either side is lost, leaving only the weaker party songs to be taken seriously.   Without any of his former associates willing to support this effort, Kurupt's production falters greatly. Sir Jinx, the man who helped Ice Cube so greatly, can't do the same for Kurupt. "Stalkin'" uses a cliche drum sample to build momentum, but the effort fails due to lack of purpose. Mark Sparks does the bulk of the album, without any stand out surprises. The most refreshing backdrop comes on "Calico," with the Dayton Family, produced by The Screwface Music Group. Here, Kurupt isn't given watered down and bastardized G-Funk, but hard drums and well-structured keys. Another collaborative highlight is the promised junction of Kurupt and Domination. "You F**kin' With the Best" does reveal positive chemistry with another, as the Eastwood, Spider Locc, and M.O.P. bonds failed to. Still, Baby C-Style's production isn't as edgy as the collaboration. Like the inconsistent messages in the words, the music on this album feels as though radio play was never a consideration of the project.   Against Tha Grain defies all of the promises of a Kurupt lyrical revival. The first artist-album on Death Row in over five years continues to rely on recycled Tupac material ("My Homeboys"). The mix of anonymous threats and peace offerings fall on deaf ears, as does music contributed by unenthused, uninspired no-names. With a Dogg Pound reunion album already in utero, Kurupt must consider his now higher wall to climb back to mainstream consciousness and present-day respect. The grains got the best of him. 
 I read several different on-line reviews for this CD before I purchased it. Each seemed to imply that this CD was a new direction for Jaci, that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature. Strange. I must have purchsed the Prozac copy of this CD because there is nothing new here from her. Like my title line to this review states, it's the exact same music she has always sang, just in a different package. Now the CD just collects dust. What a shame 
 I ordered this safe for my grandson after he e-mailed me a very accurate request.  Unfortunately, we discovered on Christmas Eve, when he opened it, that it was inoperable.  I have given his parents the return information and labels 
 This is a very comprehensive book about the general subject of raising bilingual children, based on a number of case studies. I am sure that therefore it would be of great use to anyone studying a linguistic subject in this realm.   However as a handbook for parents who want to raise a bilingual child it hardly offers any advise. I have a different native tongue than my wife, who's native language is English. Living in an English speaking country I would like my daughter to learn my (foreign) native language too. What I was looking for is a book with tips and ideas, such as word games, books, etc. to bring a second language playfully and naturally into a toddler's life.   If you are looking for such a book too, this is not the one. Although the book may be good for a linguistics student I have to give it a low rating because of its misleading title 
 I purchased this set for my 18 mo. old twins (along the the Little Mommy highchair).  The handle of the stroller came apart every time my daughters tried to push it.  The bassinet part of it did not stay in the stroller properly and the babies kept falling out.  After one hour of frustration from toddlers, I put it back in the box and brought it back.  Don't waste your money.  The highchair is very cute and sturdy 
 The message that we don't need fame or to be the strongest etc. to be happy is a good one, but this book sends a message which is not good.  For example, the animal that goes to school spends his whole time memorizig things he doesn't understand, which, yes, is not good but to a child sends the message that school is not good.  And then this hedgehog seems to get along knowing about herbs and things without having to work at all, and that more than anything is what's bad about this book.  If you want to be good at holistic medicine (like this hedgehog :), you're going to have work for it, and not spend  your days laying around in the garden.   
 It seemed like there were 2 articles & 80 pages of advertisements 
 This book deserves two stars for the message and zero for the messenger. The middle-class is indeed in trouble, but not necessarily for all the reasons Lou Dobbs offers here. It is interesting to note that as host of CNN's "Moneyline," Dobbs was a champion of the pro-business policies that have in great measure led to the pain and suffering of the middle-class. We can fairly ask when Dobbs suddenly "discovered" the middle-class; it seems to have occurred shortly after he discovered the immigration issue, when it was pointed out that many of his guests on his "Broken Borders" had ties to hate groups. Dobbs had to discover the middle-class as a facade around the immigration issue, as a cover to the fact that he was allowing people with ties to or were in fact members of white supremacist organizations to frame the debate.       Dobbs may sound "reasonable" when speaking to Al Franken on Air America, but his written words leading up to the 2006 elections are that of a xenophobe and bigot. Going from the pro-business extreme to the other has naturally led to some confusion on Dobbs part, and one wonders if he is ignorant of the racial aspect of his views or is the slickest snake oil salesman on the planet. So much for the messenger       Beyond that, one thing is for certain: after all these years as being the "expert" on the market, he never seems to have left Wall Street long enough to understand the reality on the street that he now claims to speak for.     One of these realities is than in the "good old days" Americans were over-compensated, and the bubble burst when high priced American-made goods could not compete with low-priced foreign-made goods. The result was lost manufacturing output and lost jobs that never have been replaced to any significant degree, and what new manufacturing there has been have not replicated the same wages There may have been an opportunity to arrest this development if there had been the will to reinvent domestic manufacturing in line of the new realities, but domestic output was ignored in favor of military construction during the critical years of the Reagan administration. Unlike post-WW II, this military build-up did not replicate the level of domestic manufacturing expansion.     Now, it is business executives who are over-paid, and although it is interesting to speculate how many jobs can be created if a CEO compensated $20 million a year makes just one million less, or how much it would increase workers' wages, the fact is it wouldn't be much. Wage redistribution would have to extend beyond the upper class into the "yuppie" class whose best skills seems to be moving paper and talking. By the same token, even if the nativists are correct that "low-skill" immigrants depress wages, we're only talking cents, not dollars--which would hardly propel low-wage workers into middle-class status.  Would raising minimum wage a few pennies do the trick? It is insulting to make such a claim, and furthermore studies have shown that for every 2 percent raise in the minimum wage, one percent of low-income workers are laid-off.     There are myriad other reasons why wages are depressed, such as out-of-control healthcare costs.  But in any case, for Dobbs this is all secondary to the immigration issue, which is mendacious if only for the reason that he is playing a xenophobic political game without accknowleding uncomfortable realities. It is easy to blame businesses for hiring undocumented workers, but the fact is they wouldn't be if they didn't need to, and current immigration law makes it almost impossible to obtain that labor legally. Much of the work that undocumented workers do is seasonal, migratory or otherwise require some measure of mobility, which most Americans are reluctant to do even if housing and transportation was provided by employers. And these jobs certainly do not provide a path to middle-class status.      Having staked his credibility on assaults on Mexican immigrants in league with known racists, Dobbs was a big loser in the 2006 congressional elections, no matter how mendaciously he tries to spin it as a "victory" now. "Populism" and nativism are not a mix recognized by progressives; if he thinks so, then Dobbs is an even more irrational demagogue than any of us may already suspect. 
 I'm giving this movie two stars because of the supporting actors, and, the book from which the movie is taken.  I believe those are what the rest of the reviews are truely applauding without realizing it.  Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and, seems like a nice guy, but, he needs to figure out what movies he is 'right' for, and, which ones he should turn down.    Tom, Tom .... that accent...ouch!  Sounds like you NEVER tried actually talking to someone from Alabama.  If you really did...well, honeychil', accents just aren't your thing - don't do no more of 'em!  They should have asked an English actor - they do spot on southern accents.  Maybe, it's time for a re-make with Jude Law.  Forrest was not a handsome man in the book, but, apparently, that doesn't transfer to the screen, so, get a hottie who can do an accent.  Tom's just makes my ears ache! 
 If you're looking for your first poker book, this is not the one. If you're looking for your 20th poker book, this still isn't the one. If you're stuck on a plane for two hours and the choice is the in-flight magazine vs. this book, then this book is for you.  Scott Fishman said in an interview with Phil Gordon that he hates reading books, and that he wrote this book so you can skim it in a couple of hours. He's certainly accomplished that, as this book is almost completely devoid of any content. It is full of "filler" material, like the rules of the game, hand rankings, a bunch of blank forms for keeping track of session notes, sample tournament structures, etc.  Also, he asked a few pros "What is your #1 tip for aspiring players?" The result are platitudes like "practice makes perfect", "do not dwell on your mistakes", and "focus on exploiting weaknesses in players who are worse than you". This kind of stuff takes up another dozen pages.  His main "message" can be summed up like this: there isn't a single correct style, you'll have to find what works best for you. Don't read books (he didn't), just put in time at the tables, talk to experts, practice a lot, and you'll eventually get pretty good.  Here's my favorite bit of "advice" from his book: "Before I choose a Sit-n-Go, I like to take a look at two or three that are already running to find a 'lucky seat.'...I know this sounds ridiculous, but I'll talk more about positive superstitions in the next chapter." Now mind you, the book doesn't talk about pot-odds until the appendix, where he goes on to say that they're not really important, because "odds are nearly impossible to calculate accurately." Wow! Picking a lucky seat is worth talking about, but basic concepts like pot-odds aren't?!?!  The only thing that makes this book two stars rather than completely worthless is his chapter on Sit-n-Gos. He actually shares some specific strategy ideas that are pretty interesting.  Finally, there is almost nothing in this book that is specific to online poker. Any decent discussion would have to cover the tools specific to online, such as Pokertracker and how to interpret the various stats it generates, which he barely mentions.  I think you get the picture: a quick read, lots of generalities, a waste of time 
 Scientific? I couldn't get more disgusted.  This review is written because it can accomplish much, that is, let no one science-interrested person fall in this trap.  I did never read more than 20% of the book, that is a short one, I can only guess that its because there would been to much nonsens even for the most naive readers. I read until I had heard to much about the "revoloutionating discovery" (that you have not heard of in serious papers as Nature or New Scientist, why?)  This revaloutionary discovery etc. was a machine build by someone, that claims it could measure feelings, so for example it could measure in a black room when there was a big group of people feeling the same thing, maybe an OS contestant from USA (where the machine would be) winning the championship in whatever.  Well, then it was tested in superbowl but failed, the author explains this due to commecials distorting the feelings the public felt etc...  How would this machine be able to notice somethings like this? Well they must have checked out a list of "strange" topics from physics and chosen zero point energy that has to do with the vacuum. They could not choose something like electromagnetism, because that might be disregared right away by the public who might know to much about it.  Claims that the machine is working is based on odds for it not to be this way were apperently about 1:1000 (I don't doubt that more than 1000 of these experiments have been made and failed) The author also claims that there was a scientific explaination with the feeling an moon astronaut felt when he was away from earth, he felt connected to earth in some kind of way.  I laugh in disgust, noticing this book is nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to others that actually stand out as great books, giving you an "WOOOW!" but with a scientificually accepted material as background. Examples of these are:  QED: The strange theory of light and matter by Richard Feynman, who was one of three to individually invent Quantum Electro Dynamics, that is the most fundamental description of Electromagnetism. This book is based on a series of lectures Feynman made in University of Auckland, New Zeeland, to a PUBLIC audience.  Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics by Bruce A. Schumm. A book staying focused on the subject that lies around particle physics, a Wooow! I got from this book was the connections between the mathematical Lee Groups and the quantum forces of nature (electromagnetism, the weak force, the strong force), discribed greatly on a non professional level 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 I have almost completed the Daisy Mesh Vest pattern, but wanted to forewarn those of you who want this book.  I was thrilled to get it initially, as the patterns and photography looked really good.  After this project, though, I am seriously not sure if I will try another from this book.  I consider myself to be an intermediate/advanced crocheter, and I have to say that the directions for this vest were not clearly written at all.  I have been able to figure them out as I go, but I don't like spending that much time frogging and redoing my work.  Let me make myself clear-I have NEVER had to work so hard to figure out what the pattern is trying to say.  Overall, the pattern is really simple, but the directions make it waaaaaay more complicated than it needs to be.   That being said, there are some really gorgeous things in this book, so if you are willing to take some extra time to figure out the directions, you might like it. 
 Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up "bricking" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon 
 Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is all the rage now. Unfortunately, most of the hype is for high-frequency RFID, i.e. 915 MHz and above. High-freq RFID systems are incredibly complicated, and are difficult to set up and get into good working condition, mostly because high-freq RFID is HIGHLY susceptible to electromagnetic interference, plus interference from water, liquids, metal, etc. People also need to be familiar with LOW-FREQUENCY RFID, which I'll get to in a moment.  While Wal-Mart and the DoD are leading the push to integrate high-freq RFID into everyday supply-chain systems, many of the systems simply don't work; again, because of the limitations I discussed above.  RFID for Dummies is a decent primer for HIGH-FREQ RFID, not low-freq RFID (125-134 KHz frequencies in the U.S.). In fact, the book only mentions low-freq RFID a couple of times. There's a tried-and-true system for low-freq that's been around for more than 15 years, while this high-freq RFID stuff has been struggling like a lost babe in the jungle.  This book, again, is not for low-freq RFID, which is now used to track and ID animals, humans, medical devices, weapons, sensitive items, automobiles, gas cylinders, trees, etc. The high reliability of low-freq is unquestionable.   More about this book: the physics section is weak, at best. The author obviously wasn't a physics or electrical engineering major in college or grad school. Too bad, because many people out there could use a good lesson in HOW RFID works. Some good diagrams and figures woulda done the trick here. I've talked with dozens of people who are now implementing RFID in their work, and ALL of them commented that they would love to see a simple set of figures and diagrams that illustrate how the technology works.   So, if you're interested in a book about HIGH-FREQUENCY RFID, and you don't need a lesson in the physics of RFID, then I would recommend you read this book at the library.   Unfortunately, there are NO really good general books about RFID out there. You're better off reading white papers found on various RFID web sites.  WARNING: THIS BOOK DOES NOT DISCUSS LOW-FREQUENCY RFID. IT IS ABOUT HIGH-FREQUENCY RFID ONLY 
 THESE HAVE TO BE THE WORST SONGS OF ALL TIME. STEVE MILLER THE JOKER, QUEENS WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST, AND BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY AND BOSTON'S MORE THAN A FEELING.  DON'T LISTEN TO THIS BAND OR THE OTHER JUNK BANDS THAT I MENTIONED. 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 This movie was boring and there are no good songs on this soundtrack skip it 
 I actually returned this book because it had very little , if anything, to do with WHY you actually compulsively eat. it did not go into or even explained the psychological factors that influence C.O. all this book talk about is how women's self-image is polluted with diet ads etc, etc. it does not deal at all with how to actually stop, in an effective way.   same thing as Overcoming Overeating. the whole point of the book is to stop dieting and to stop having a dieting mentality. also it doe snot deal with the actual cause of you overeating ( which is not dieting)   if you really want to overcome overeating and end your obsession with food, you need to know why you are physiologically addicted to food. why you find so much pleasure in it. and for that you have to read books with substantial research, not just a feminist sound-off.   read : the pleasure trap, LIfe is hard- food is easy , to name a few good ones.   but this one and her other one won't help you at all. 
 This item deserves a zero as a rating.  I never had problems with CDs as I did with this 8-CD set.  They refuse to play when you make a selection. When I placed them in multiple CD players, they sounded as if an airplane was taking off. These are very poor quality CDs for $100.  Do not waste your money on this item.  
 I didn't like this at all.  I found it chemical, and not nicely redolent of the ginger I O so, love.  I just gave it away, cute little tin and all.  I am adventurous, so I do happen on things I feel aren't what I expected from time to time.  This was certainly one of them.  I'm sure some of you will like like it, don't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds.  Mine said: "This tea is not a real peach, either.

 After "Lazarus Long" I had high expectations for this audio book.  It seems, however, that Heinlein "lost it" between 1946 and 1961!  The book starts out interestingly enough but once VMS goes out on his own, it becomes a joke!  Heinlein's endless anti-religion, diatribes, voiced through the mouths of VMS and the insufferable "Jubal Hershaw" made me want to chew my leg off, just to get away!  (Apologies to "Hitchiker's Guide!")  I stuck it out though, hoping for a "second wind," but there was no wind, just a SUCKING sound! Jubal is basically Marvin the Robot on downers! Any real person with his outlook would've eaten a gun LONG ago.  VMS is an "Ubermench" strung out on Qualludes!  "I grock this...I grock that...I grock grocking..." Blah Blah Blah.  I didn't grock this book at all! The final scene wherein VMS allows himself to be vivisected reminded me of the "Black Knight" scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail"..."It's only a flesh wound!" Oh, and lastly, what's with Foster and Digby and VMS himself in some sort of weird afterlife "adjusting their halos!?"  Methinks Heinlein may have discovered Acid in his later life. Bottom line, a waste of 16 hours of my time...thank God (yes, THAT God!) I didn't have to pay for it 
 Many albums, including this one, have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks.  The use of many poetry elements in their lyrics can't save the blandness of the music.  "What About Everything" and "Life Less Ordinary" are good songs.  The rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep.  
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 This is the stupidest book I have ever read- including Dr. Seuss! I think that Mary Pipher has some childhood issues that need to be worked out, because she stereotypes girls at a certian age as being something they usually aren't. I really can't say that it was worth the time I spent reading it 
 This may very well be the most poorly written,least well thought out,blatantly built on lies book that has ever been published. I mean,making up things about Michael Jackson seems to be a favorite past time of losers like this that have no life of their own to attend to,I understand that and all,but where's the payoff? I mean,seriously. A guy that has no more idea of what goes on Jackson's personal life than the table setting here in my living room goes out of his way to write a fictional book about someone he has no clue about. But what's the point exactly? I'm in the dark to it,if there is one. Sadly,there are many out there who are as thick as this author and will eat it all up with a shovel. Whatever gets them through the day I suppose.   Basically,the point is,the only thing this entire waste of natural resources got right about Michael Jackson was the spelling of his name,and if the author himself penned it,I'd lay down even money that even that needed to be cross checked 
 The title intrigued.  The book . . . not really a book but a group of essays, one of which provided the title . . . disappointed.  Spending ten pages of fine print on the exact definition of a word left me a bit angry -- angry that I do not have the courage to toss a book that I have paid for and started to read 
 Uncomfortable and heavy for bar ends and useless as mirrors. As mentioned, the mirrors are of a terrible quality. To top that, they do not stay in place when adjusted

 I hate lawyers.  What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb.   Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"   Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it.   But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money.   Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention.   I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?  What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**.   Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice.   Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment.   So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner.   Talk about contempt of court.  Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob.   Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much.   Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice.   Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't.   Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.    Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous.   If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar.   Otherwise, case dismissed.   JS 
 Amazon is out of RED.  After waiting for 2 months, they shipped a white while the packing list states red.  When contacted, they said that they do not have a red for replacement.  If I want a white I can get it elsewhere for $7.99.  Not I have to go through the trouble of returning it 
 This book tries to teach piano the way rock and folk guitar is often learned: it tells you to form chords by putting your hands in certain positions, giving short shrift to the principles of chord construction and  voicing and virtually ignoring the principles of voice-leading. The  inevitable result is a confused and unmusical pianist. For adults and older  children I use John Thompson's MODERN COURSE FOR PIANO. I often supplement  this with John Clough's SCALES, INTERVALS, KEYS, TRIADS, AND METER. I  advise those of my students interested in jazz and rock music to use Jeff  Burns's PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST 
 With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult comes down a level in terms of quality.  Rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well, this novel is a pinball machine of ideas, people and issues that never come together.  I kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word 
 This book begins with the absurd claim that 'the natural numbers -1, 2,3, 4 etc- appear to have been present at the birth of the universe; part and parcel of the original material from which was knit the ever-expanding continuum of space-time.' The author does not explain in whose mind these numbers are supposed to have appeared or how a concept can be present without a mind to concieve it. Like many mathematicians he seems unable to grasp that mathematics is a language. Thus it's not uncommon to hear ridiculous statements like 'the universe is governed by mathematics' As if numbers exert forces. But this is the first time I've encountered the claim that numbers existed prior to life!   
 I bought Wood's more recent book on maps (Seeing Through Maps: Many Ways to See the World) through amazon, and was somewhat disappointed (see my review there). So, this time around, I decided to get this book from my public library (yay for public libraries!). Boy am I glad I did! (Because I would have kicked myself if I had paid money for this one.) It appears that this book was later condensed to provide much of the material for "Seeing Through Maps...".  I can agree with most of what other reviewers have said about this book: The Ferris-Bueller moments (what an apt description!) caused by excessive use of ellipsis, the use of drawings by a three-year-old (literally) on many pages, the post-modernist over-intellectualized ramblings that tend to detract from what are perfectly valid and interesting points: the people in power really *do* draw the maps, and maps *do* give some people power (and take it away from others) by manipulating our conception of the world.   It's too bad that someone didn't reign the author in, in both of those books. He's really his own worst enemy. The writing is rambling and repetitive: you find yourself muttering "OK! OK! I *get* it! Can we move ON please!". With apologies to Blaise Pascal, it seems if the author had had more time, he could have written a shorter book.  I think it's really a shame that both books lack even a single colour plate, since maps possess beauty in addition to power, but perhaps it was appropriate to de-emphasize the beauty and focus on the power for the purposes of this book. Prospective readers should know that the "power" referred to in the title is of an ethereal, intellectual kind, that is perceived in the mind, not in the eyes. 
 As a general practitioner, I don't recommend this book for professionals who want to improve in advanced knowledge in physiology. It is a STARTER book on the theme, for medical students only, not for practicising doctors.  I've got frustrated 
 In the years since September 11th, 2001 many authors have tried their hands at the 9/11 novel, with all of its delicate subject matter, and thus far they have met with only limited degrees of success: Jonathan Safran Foer, Julia Glass, Wendy Wasserstein, and others have centered novels on the pre- and post-9/11 era, and now Claire Messud takes her turn with "The Emperor's Children," a novel set during the months preceding and immediately following that horrific day. The titular 'emperor' is Murray Thwaite, a prestigious journalist living the quintessential Manhattan lifestyle: fame, money, parties, and the adoration of literati and socialites alike. He has cultivated an image based on truth and integrity, although those charactersitics are notably lacking in his actual person. His 'children' are the people immediately surrounding him, captivated by his presence and hoping to coast on his celebrity with varying degrees of maliciousness. At the novel's onset most of them are suffering from some form of paralysis about their life's direction. First and foremost is Marina, Murray's daughter, who seems hopelessly trapped in a prolonged adolescence -- afraid that if she grows up and tries to make her way in the world she will be unable to live up to her famous father's reputation (the thought of disappointing him is particularly troubling to her). It is easy to forget that Marina is 30 years old because she is quite deliberately written like a high school aged socialite. Then there is Murray's nephew, Frederick "Bootie" Tubb,  who has grown up in awe of his distant uncle and comes to Manhattan after dropping out of college to ask him to be his mentor. Bootie, an intelligent but overly philosophical and idealistic young man, quickly becomes disillusioned with Murray (for who could possibly live up to the lofty expectations that celebrity produces?), and becomes determined to expose his uncle for the charlatan he believes him to be. Complicating things further is Ludovic Seeley, a smarmy Australian businessman who has come to Manhattan to start his own magazine -- and aims to shake up the existing journalistic order by dethroning the reigning king. Ludovic is such an arrogant cliche that all he needs is a mustache to sinisterly twirl to be an outright cartoon. Lastly, there are Marina's best friends: Julius, a gay hanger-on from chilly Michigan eager to make an impression on the New York social scene, and Danielle, who is presumably the humane center for the novel to pivot on, but suffers from such ludicrous Ally McBeal-esque crises in her love life that her credibility is dangerously suspect after the first hundred pages. The characters are uniformly pretentious and are alternately mildly and seriously annoying, but Messud manages to propel her novel forward despite their intrinsic unlikability because, as shallow as they are, they are all multi-layered, complex, believable people. The many threads comprising the narrative are expertly weaved together for some compelling character studies (even if you wouldn't necessarily want to hang out with the lot of them). But that willingness to stick with their stories is, at least for me, predicated on the belief that they will be changed people by the novel's end. They aren't. And while the narrative is expertly crafted, Messud has a penchant for overusing commas in her prose that becomes, increasingly, irritating, as she uses them to stretch out her sentences, and to add separate thoughts, or descriptive elements, and even, occasionally, dialogue, so that they feel like run-ons, like this one right here, this example I've devised for you, but are, for the most part, technically, grammatically sound, even though you may have to re-read the most trying sentences a second time, just to figure out what she is saying, without letting all of her distractions get in the way.   Messud does an admirable job building suspense as the chapters go by and September 11th draws near. There is a great degree of foreshadowing to be found, some directly indicating that September will be a month of great change, what with Ludovic's magazine set to launch on the 13th and a wedding to take place, but naturally none of the characters can predict just how fateful the month will prove to be. The sense of impending disaster looms large in "The Emperor's Children," and it is quite unfortunate that the novel loses steam when tragedy actually strikes. Indeed, 9/11 is almost anticlimactic when it occurs, serving merely as a catalyst to wrap up everyone's story lines. It was unbearably annoying to endure the outrageously selfish way that the characters responded to the attacks and the gross loss of life that they witnessed. In the late afternoon of that day, after the towers had fallen and Manhattan's skyline was irrevocably altered forever there wasn't a lot of soul searching going on in the hearts and minds of these characters. All they care about are their own petty problems and how the terrorists ruined their carefully planned calendars (I felt like throwing the book across the room in disgust when Ludovic had the audacity to go on a tirade about how his precious magazine's launch had to be cancelled). I live in the tri-state area, about an hour and a half away from Ground Zero, and the events of that day and the intense mourning that followed will be with me for the rest of my life, and what Messud has critically failed to capture is the way that 9/11 actually brought a grieving city closer together for a brief moment in time, and how for once people put aside their petty complaints to work on the larger issue at hand. I remember crying at work alongside my stunned colleagues and the reassuring hugs we gave each other, the phone calls I made to -- and received from -- people I hadn't even spoken to in months or even years, just to make sure that they were all right. I remember the eagerness with which people helped each other out, whether the need was great or small. This incredible outbreak of brotherly love earned the admiration of the world, but it is conspicuously absent from Messud's telling. One character uses the tragedy for personal gain career-wise, one uses it as an excuse to wallow in self pity (not for anything to do with 9/11, mind you, but for strictly personal reasons) ... I don't want to give too much away by outlining the callous behavior that offended me so much, but in my opinion it was woefully inappropriate. I had hoped that tragedy would change the Emperor and his Children for the better, but I was wrong. And it's a shame. Messud is definitely a capable, promising writer -- but this isn't her finest hour

 Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 This is a small book, about the size of one of the super thin CD cases.  It tells you about one cool thing to do per two page spread.  It has about 50 pages.  Do you get the idea?    It is well suited for someone who wants to go just a tiny bit beyond what the ipod packaging itself tells you.  Many of the things it tells you are simply how to turn on or off various options.  This is a good book for someone who doesn't want to get involved in doing very much with their ipod, but just wants to know a bit more than what apple tells you.    If you're getting an ipod as a gift for a person who is not experienced with technology, it would be a good choice.  However, if you're the type who is using amazon to find an ipod book, you would probably find this book unsatisfying 
 Looks great but don't get trusted, this is the worst killer shark film ever! The shark looks so fake and during all the movie he only killed like 4 people and that's it. So please don't see this movie I'm warning you 
 These DVDs have a funky copy protection that caused the disc to get stuck in my mac mini.  As of yet, I have not been able to remove it.  I don't want to force it out or have to pay for something because of this manufacturer's stupidity.  It is definitely copy protected because when I tried to play it on Windows, it refused due to copyright issues.  I was only trying to play it on my PC!  I wasn't even copying it.  If you plan on watching it on your computer, forget about it... it won't work.  Not even on Media Center.  For copy protection alone I have to rate this set at the lowest setting.  If I was able to play the discs, I would give a decent recent but the protection has rendered both the discs and my computer useless 
 I used to be a step aerobics fanatic.  I am just now progressing from my physical therapy into a more "normal" workout regimen after herneating a disk in my lower back last year and thought this video would be a nice compliment to my elliptical workouts.  While I thought the lower body workout was solid, I thought the upper body workout was mediocre.  And I was disappointed in the abdominal exercises.  I thought it was bad form to encourage beginners to hold on to the back of the legs for crunches.    Most of all, I would not recommend this workout for anyone who has experienced a major back injury in the past.  I followed all of the instructor's directions for beginners and am currently in the most back pain I have experienced since last August 
 I purchased this book as a reference for discus. Instead, it went through all of the details of setting up a fish tank, something one should be well informed about before even attempting to set up a discus tank.  Some of the information seemed contradictory or incorrect. The sections about discus were short and not detailed. This is not the book for any serious discus owner or owner-to-be 
 This book is nowhere close to the original "Stick Fighting." It seems that it is attempting to pry into on the reputation of the former book. When comparing the two books, this should not be entitled "Stick Fighting 2" but something completely different. Buy it only if you plan to sell it later or are adding it to a Hatsumi collection. 
 My daughter is in [...] and doesn't talk or act like Junie B. Neither do any of the other first graders I know. While some of her comments are funny, for the most part, I find her offensive. My daughter has a really hard time reading and understanding these books because the grammar is so bad and Junie B doesn't have a linear train of thought when she speaks. Try other series like Cam Jansen, the Littles, et 
 It does not surprize me that this book has dropped over 200% in retail price. It wouldn't even get a passing grade in a beginning creative writing class - it's that poorly written. The fact that it's being promoted as "non-fiction" is an insult to the intelligence of consumers. I can only hope that we've seen the last of James Frey. 
 If you've ever sat through film studies and wondered what on earth was going on, don't fret.    There is probably something to be gained from studying how we watch films, but unfortunately most of those engaged in the world of film studies as academics aren't interested.  Instead, many are content to wallow in unreadable texts with long, impressive terms that, in the end, have little at all to do with films.    Studying modes of production, the words of the filmmakers themselves, trends, etc, we can figure out a lot about films.  But that's not good enough for some people because it's too straightforward and obvious.  Instead, an entire vocabulary needs to be invented--poststructuralism, film semiotics, etc, etc, in order to mask the quite obvious fact that we still don't know a thing.    If we had any concrete understanding of how films 'work' on our minds, then someone could write a book that a 12 year old could read and understand.  Instead, we get books like this: inpenetrable, heavy, intellectual tripe.    If you believe there is actually a 'theory' to film, and that such a 'theory' can be applied to a large body of film and work, then this might be for you.  If you're more interested in the real world, on planet Earth, you may want to avoid the subject altogether.. 
 Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial.  Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris.  Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue.  Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen.  Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time.  Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine.   
 Keneally writes reasonably well -- not exciting, but serviceable prose. Possibly if you are a committed Catholic and interested in the difference between today's Catholic beliefs and those of fifty years ago, this novel might keep you awake. Otherwise, this novel is exhausting in its exploration of an inexperienced priest's coming-of-age, and the plot is slow-paced--I couldn't make it to the promised murder. Besides, the victim was so uninteresting, I couldn't bring myself to care who might have killed her 
 I'm sorry, I just can't get hot and bothered about Angela's Ashes.  No characters with any admirable qualities, endlessly wallowing in their own sense of despair.  Parents who can't be bothered to do something to provide their children with the bare essentials, but who can always find the money for booze or cigarettes.  The father, a low life, big mouthed, lazy good for nothing who drinks all the time, doesn't bother to provide for his family, but refuses to accept charity so that his children can eat.  A mother who would rather function as a prostitute to a filthy, degraded, disgusting relative than go out and do some work.  People talk in reviews here about this woman's great self-sacrifice, but I noticed that she never failed to have a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, though her kids were going hungry and having to walk through the overflow of a toilet just to get into their house.  I can't see any great self-sacrifice there - just laziness, lack of self-respect and self-indulgence.  I can't see anything funny in this film, and certainly nothing noble in any of the characters.  Can't imagine what all the hoopla is about, or how anyone could consider such a tragic and infuriating situation, brought about by adults who refuse to be adults and take responsibility, funny in any way at all 
 ... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.  To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another "blockbuster" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending 
 When I read the liner notes, I was worried that Archer was going to turn to Brown's formulaic and excruciating style of story telling rife with arcane and improbable clues and wild goose chases. He doesn't, thankfully, but the results are nonetheless disappointing.  Archer still shows signs of being a good story teller in this book, but gone were the excitement, interest, and diabolical twists to which we have become accustomed in his writing. As others have mentioned, plot twists were mostly uininteresting. They were also excruciatingly obvious (except for one, which was simply wrapped up in two "let's get this over with" paragraphs near the end. And even that one was predictable early on.  And don't get me started about what the author tries to pass off as "witty dialogue. 
 I automatically deduct 2 stars from a cookbook with no pictures.  Other than that it is pretty good 
 Pretty graphics, no art.  Looks nice but playability sucks.  Terrible keyboard controls, requires multiple clicks from scrolling lists to do simple things like cast a spell.  Quests confusing, sometimes screen pixel hunt and click required.  Very limited, laughable, quick key assignment.  Can't even bring up the area map with a single click/key!!!  No personal journaling or marking maps on this huge game area.  Wait for it on the $9.99 rack, or maybe user content will make something of it.  Seems like a great graphics engine with little RPG behind it.  Seems very much designed by committee with features removed when anyone didn't like it.  Get NeverWinter Nights 1 instead.  Update after about 50 hours into it:  The inside caves, it seems, are made of a very limited tile set.  There is a narrow tunnel, an open cave, and open cave with upper shelves on each side, or a cave with an above cross-over.  Textures are cut stone, some are rough stone, but the shapes are the same.  Very boring, you now know where to look for the monsters.  Guess console players are less demanding.  Too much money went into the cut scenes, not enough into the RPG engine 
 We have been unsuccessful with this e-reader attachment since we purchased it. Cards read once and never again. Doesn't matter if we use the GB SP or Advance. Still doesn't do anything. Don't recommend you waste your money 
 sensationalist, titiliating, and as a result, a total let-down (much like "heavier than heaven")  while Cross's journalistic eye provides some interesting detail re: Jimi's early years, after that, it reads like "Hammer of the Gods" meets the National Inquirier.  just plain silly, and a disservice to the greatest guitar player ever.  Cross spends more time examining Jimi's proclivity for groupies and drugs (which, of course, is part of the story...i guess), than the music itself.  It would have been nice to know, say:  In 1966, preceding acid rock and living in a relatively tame NYC, how did Hendrix come to write the songs that comprised "Are You Experienced"?  how did his playing transcend his predecessors?  how did dylan influence his songwriting?  (we learn Hendrix *did* emulate Dylan's hair.)  we don't know.  now, if Cross was unable to formulate  answers on his own, then could have easily dialed up a litany of rock critics, musicians, and fans who'd be happy to extrapolate.    instead we get only crumbs, which are ultimately overshadowed by second-hand stories from druggies ("jimi didn't like alcohol!", ex-groupies ("jimi wanted to marry me!", and hangers-on ("jimi slept with 8 chicks at once.")  it was thorougly exasperating.  if you came from Mars and read this, your impression would be that yes, Jimi was messed up and reckless; but you would have no idea he was one of the most influencial artists in the history of the world.  if the book meant to honor Hendrix, it did the opposite.    if you want incisive analysis of the *music* itself, simply read Amazon readers' reviews of his records.  The fans themselves -- not an overwrought author -- can encapsulate the power and beauty of Hendrix far better, and far more consisely. 
 I personally feel Tom Hanks is a really fantastic actor.  With the exception of this particular movie, I've enjoyed every movie I've ever seen him in.  I don't understand what went wrong with The Ladykillers, perhaps it was the director, the editor, the script . . . I don't know, but this movie was so awful I couldn't sit through it.  I purchased a copy of it just knowing I'd absolutely love it because Tom Hanks was in it but I ended up pawning it off on some unsuspecting co-worker 
 I bought this CD because it said Eamon as an artist. WTH? I can't find Eamon anywhere on this CD. It says Eamon on the other one, but I'm not even going to try. Never again will a buy a CD associated with Agnus Dei.  LAST WORD: Don't buy this if your buying it for Eamon music 
 This boring mess just made me put on the originals - which are SO GREAT. A pointless release.  Another reviewer knocked the duos's last release "Nightbird" - however I found that the most refreshing recording they had done in ages.  This feels like a contractual obligation and sounds like how an unsalted saltine with generic peanut butter would taste.  Go for the originals 
 "Brothers In Arms" by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton.   Subtitled "The Epic Story Of The 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's  Forgotten Heroes". Broadway books, New York, 2004.    Studying History gives you exposure to the overall events of World War II, and the general ebb and flow of the European Theater of Operations, such as which unit attacked which enemy unit and the results. After an MA in History,  I am always seeking more interesting personal accounts, i.e. personal reminiscences, describing what really happened.  This book, "Brothers In Arms", appeared to be just that: the personal memoirs of black soldiers in a tank battalion in the EOT, with all those daily minimal details, woven into a real and personal story of the men who served.  Even more interesting, these soldiers were black.   Unfortunately, however, the book did not live up to its promise.  The stories about the individuals involved, with the possible exception of  Leonard "Smitty" Smith, did not, in my humble opinion, bring those individuals alive.  Even the nice repetition , (but disrupting to the continuity of the book), of Baseball's Jackie Robinson's wartime experiences were not truly a personal remembrance.      Then there are the unnecessary mistakes.  As other reviewers have mentioned the worst gaffe, the German word for panther, is "Panther" and "Panzer" means, basically,  armor or tanks.  See page 47.  The Luftwaffe's  rotund Hermann Goering is probably rotating rapidly in his grave since this book identifies him as the skinny Nazi propaganda minister.  On page 45, the authors state that  in the Pacific theater, in 1942, "American and Japanese forces were at a stalemate".   Sorry!  The Battle of Midway, June 1942, was the turning point and it was downhill for Japan after that. The "stalemate" characterization  was wrong.  On page 70, the authors have General George S. Patton being born in 1895; he was born in 1885.  Just as another example,  the book states that the German "Teller"  Anti-Tank mines had about one pound of explosive in them.  I could not understand why a "Teller" mine should threaten a Sherman tank, so I went on the Web.  There I found that the early models of the German Teller mines  had about 23 pounds, or about ten kilograms, of explosive.  I could see that this concentrated explosive force could do damage to some parts of the Sherman.  My complaint is the book's authors let this poundage gaffe go into print.  So , for the personal memoirs, I gave four stars.  For the mistakes , (too many!) and evident lack of knowledge about the History of the EOT, I gave zero stars.  Average: two stars.  
 Pretty bad movie.  I only bought it because I lost the library's copy.  I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to actually enjoy it.    
 At the end of this movie, which i wasted 7 dollars 10 people at once said in unison, That was horrible. The movie isn't scary, the plot is patched together like a class of 1st graders trying to make a novel and they all have to write one page.  The acting is well horrible.  The visuals were cool but i think a lot of that was that they were on a big screen.  Personally I laughed threw the whole thing and i guess my money was well spent cause all my buddy's were reference the horrible and pointless climatic scene.  
 This isn't a fair representation of the Reagan years.  First off, it's a fact that Ethel Rosenberg was a communist.  Like it or not, she, along with her husband, was a spy!  They lied to the American public and they were a detrimant.  Reviving Ethel Rosenberg like that was done quite tastelessly.  Furthermore, it's a fact that Ronald Reagan has spent 5.7 billion dollars to help research AIDS!  It isn't Reagan who helped spread the disease of AIDS it was unprotected sex. Ronald Reagan being a Republican-Conservative was used as a scapegoat in this play.  I don't mind if this play is trying to spread a liberal agenda (the more power to you!), but I do mind that they do it in spite of a great President with lies 
 For years, I've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for low-budget horror movies, but I'd rather watch ANYTHING shot on video than watching the waste of film that is Dead Life. Don't be fooled when I say this movie is shot on film. It SERIOUSLY looks like it was shot on a 1950s 8mm camera. It's perpetually grainy, dark, fuzzy, and shaky, and not in an artsy way. My $200 video camera looks infinitely better than this. The video quality is appropriate, however, as it's matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this stink-fest. The sound is murky and undecipherable, the acting is strictly amateur hour, the characters are paper-thin with no distinction or purpose, the story is non-existent, the dialogue is a completely worthless bore, there's nothing remotely scary, and the special effects (including a couple of computer effects that look like they were made on a Commodore 64) are laughable. Or, at least, I wish they were laughable. That would've at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this (high school) student film. It's movies like this -- cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy, but which get cherry spots on Blockbuster shelves because they're packaged with slick cover art -- that give horror movies in general (and zombie movies in particular) a bad name, and that make horror fans so wary. Disgraceful! 
 Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes & Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light 
 I beat this mix longer than the 10 minutes suggested, and it was still too runny to even stay in my angelfood cake pan.  It baked flat & a disgusting rubbery texture, and was completely inedible.  When I very nicely wrote about my concerns and to request a product refund, the Customer Service person said they could not give me a refund, and said "thank you for your understanding" -- huh??  I'll never purchase any more of their products 
 Boring and not much insight. Just a rap film, nothing about the true  culture of hip-hop. Some decent preformances, but if you want to really get  the real, check out Rhyme & Reason 
 when i bought movie thought i would see more than one arab biased anti american news media...... 
 type smudges / translation bad / in short, a disposable boo 
 This book has glaring errors in the chapter regarding Dr. Gary Kildall and CP/M.  The author trashes DOS as a "slapdash clone" and a "rip-off" of CP/M, which is simply untrue.  Tim Paterson, the author of DOS, is in fact suing the publisher and the author over numerous misrepresentations in the book.  Save your money and get a book that is better researched 
   Bad script. You cannot expect Cuba Gooding, a fine actor, to do something with nothing. General Burt Reynolds in full dress uniform smoking a pipe? The always dynamic James Woods is even restrained from his usual machine gun mouth didactic style. Now Angie Harmon does get a chance to act, but with who?    Secret Service Agent Cuba deflects a bullet with his hand which inadvertantly kills the President. It was a magic bullet because, miracle of miracles, no damage was done to his hand. In an overwhelming display of guilt he tries to drink himself to death only to be awakened by reporter Angie to whom he promptly farts in the face. That's just the first 15 minutes folks.   We then get treated to the conspiracy and a whole lotta killing going on. Extreme closeups, handheld cameras, and of course the filtered color to heighten suspense.   The ending is the final lowpoint of the film. How did the killer procure and finance all this? And after all they've been through Agent Cuba punks out and refuses to tell reporter Angie.   Anne Archer, one of my alltime favorites, has a supporting role as The First Lady, who is also a painter. She is lovely and so are the paintings.   It's a shame but it could have a contender thriller 
 Succinctly put, this is probably the worst science fiction book I've read, and I've read a lot of them. I'll go point by point:  1: The idea. Some may call this novel "innovative," but that is most certainly a misuse of the word. The main idea of this book is that "incest" as we now use this word is ok as long as it either 1) genetically harmless; 2) failing the first condition, does not produce babies. Incest and other such "alternative family relationships," as another reviewer so mildly put it, is not a new idea at all. Now, I am not close minded to anything, but the sort of self-serving and constant glorification of what is ultimately a bad idea even biologically speaking that Heinlein subjects his readers too is boring, unimaginative, uninformative, and frankly morbid.  2: The plot. Nonexistent. There is no dynamic to the story. Heinlen meanders from one time-frame to another with no logic to tie them all up. There is an interesting story here and there, but they serve no meaningful purpose, except to, again, glorify (and not simply justify) "alternative family relationships."  3: The characters. I haven't found any. At least none that were really interesting. There is Lazarus, who is basically a sleazeball who is rules by his two cardinal instincts entirely: survival and reproduction. There are women, who are uniformely and without exception ruled by only one of those two instincts: reproduction. Others in the book are basically filler material.  4: The writing. Atrocious. Heinlein puts too much faith in dialogue. I say too much because he can't write it. All dialogues are protracted and artificial, they are never to a point, and they all sound alike. The last point bears repeating: you can almost never tell whose speech you are reading, except when 1) someone says they want Lazarus' baby (this happens often and it's a clue that a female character must be speaking) or 2) someone reminisces about the days of yore (that's a clue to Lazarus). But the style of the speech is the same for everyone.  5. The science fiction. Nonexistent. There are references to "rejuvenation," "time travel," and space colonization. But that's about as far as we get. There is absolutely no elaboration on how, for instance, a ten-fold increase in lifespan would have affected the reproductive choices of humanity. This is particulaly puzzling since all characters in the story are of such extraordinary verility. Put two and two together: if all women have babies every year or so, and all of those babies live for a thousand years each, how long will it take you to overpopulate a planet? The answer is: hardly any time at all. Yet Heinlein never pauses to explain how the economies of his worlds continue to function and never stops to elaborate on the causes of social collapses that do happen from time to time.   Last thing. Why did I spend all this time writing a review. Because I find it troubling that so many give this book 5-stars. This is not a worthwile read. If you are interested in romance novels, go to a different section: Heinlein is probably not the best in that genre. If you are interested in science fiction with well-developed ideas and good fiction, pick up Asimov, Greg Bear, Stephen Baxter (bad writing but great science), John C. Wright, Will McCarthy, or Vernor Vinge 
 While the mitt is beautiful and the price is right, it is narrow.  Most mitts flare towards the opening, this one does not.  I have larger forearms and it won't fit all the way up.  My husband has average sized arms and it won't go around his upper forearm either.  Since they are so long they go almost to your elbow 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 This book is a total bore. The flowery description is beautiful for the first three sentences, but then it becomes a tranparent cover-up for a book with no plot! Even I could write a more interesting book, and I failed high school english! Muir was a great person, but he sould have stayed where he was better aquianted: the woods! Anyone who enjoys this book obviously has never seen a tree before. A whole book dedicated to them is ironic and lame 
 If you want a picture book to leaf thru, I guess it's okay.  As far as practical ideas, forget it.  Most of the homes here are very site-specific, and most are multi-story.  I didn't really see any innovations or adaptable ideas that I could actually use in my own home construction, which was why I bought it.  
 way too general, and not updated enough for those who are not risk averse gen-xer 
 This book is a somewhat enjoyable and a quick read.  It starts with some very interesting concepts that offer the promise of great science fiction philosophy.  Unfortunately the author seemed to get tired towards the end of the book and doesn't put much effort into ending what starts as a great book.    At first, I thought the author was writing a book based on a concept that was pretty original.  That is the concept that an entire book could be written with a protagonist, but no antagonist.  With no clearly defined villian, the hero was free to explore more than just the tight boundries dictated by modern day media entertainment.  And for two-thirds of the book this concept is brilliant and works very well.  Unfortunately, at some point the author seems to "wake up" and realize that he has no where to go with the book because he has run out of ideas or he is too scared to creatively finish what he has started.  And so within the last 40 pages of the book he creates your typical villian character and ends the book on a huge cliche.  Sad, this book could have been so much better if the author had stayed true to his original premise 
 I prefer my spoons to stand upright. Many of my spoons fall out of this one, I guess it depends on your shape of the spoon 
 The title of this book is unfortunately misleading.  If you believe, as I do, that "Web Services" has something to do with SOAP (or more specifically, nuSOAP or other PHP-specific library) then prepare to be disappointed if you buy this book!  The closest thing you will find is a short discussion of the Amazon API and Google translation services, a slim 24 page chapter out of the entire 400+ page book.  These are both already documented online. The rest is an intermediate-level discussion of common PHP applications, which are addressed as well (if not better) in a number of other books...  Not recommended.      Postscript: Based on the ratings for this review, I felt it necessary to add the following clarifying comments:  This book is a decent introduction to general PHP web programming.  However (and most PHP newbies would not know this), "Web Services" is a VERY specific programming term used to describe some relatively advanced concepts, e.g. Remote Procedure Calls between hardware-agnostic servers.    So what we have here is a book that explicitly claims to provide some specific, advanced programming knowledge.  THE BOOK DOES NOT DELIVER ON THE PROMISE IMPLIED BY ITS TITLE!  No matter how good an introductory book this is, readers should be warned that they will not come away with any increased knowledge of "Web Services".  Caveat Emptor 
 I'm not reviewing the show itself, but rather the colorization. (If you've seen the show, you know whether you like it; if you haven't seen it, you can read the many other reviews.) The show is lighthearted fun and not to be taken seriously, but if I'm bothered by the colorization, it must be really bad. Unless you like Jeannie with orange hair and people who look like they've drunk a bottle of ink, skip this version and get the BW set.  Then you won't be constantly distracted by weird and wrong colors 
 This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation.  If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress & strain book its more poorly written then the Marks 
 I used to listen the Dream Theater "back in the day" so I thought I'd check them out.  I can't believe how bad this CD is.  Am I glad I didn't pay full price for this.  What a boring, pretentious pice of crap 
 I was disappointed in this volume. In the first episode, Tsume's recollection, it was practically the entire first episode replayed. I would have liked to see some more in-depth monologue (thoughts) around the emotional aspect of what the characters were going through as they recalled them. There was a little of this but it could have been much better thought out vol 4. I feel this was a missed opportunity for some indepth character development. The characters are so rich,it is a shame. The episode mantage (as i'll call these "recollections")I felt that was best put together was Hige's. I wish they had new schenes or angels that were part of the recalled events,new sequences at the very least. This would have served the same intention (to summarize the story thus far) but would have added a deeper dimension to the characters. Fortunatlly I rented this whole series before I decided to buy it.  I came across volume three first, thinking it was a stand alone movie. (I was in a hurry.)Oh course I was completely lost. Clearly this was the climax of the series. So I returned to begin from Volume one. When I got to this volume I was shocked. I spead through it, partly fast forwarding. Waiting for any thing new!  Nothing but a piece of dialouge or two! What a waste! And at $18.00-40.00 volume, don't bother!  I'll only buy this if I find it in the greatly reduced bin for $5.00 or less!  Thank you reviewers for your warnings!  Bandai,why did you cheat us like this?! 
 When I first read the synopsis of this book, I thought that it would be an interesting read.  After the first 20 or so pages I was not sure what I had gotten myself into.  The writing style seemed awkward and the phrase "I'd like to know" came up so often it became extremely annoying and at times out of place. Writing style aside, the premise of this book was very similar to the movie and series "Stargate" but less interesting and more confusing.  The book itself seemed to be a mishmash of different stories and ideas.  The book never seemed to flow.  Sometimes the story went quickly and the reader was left trying to figure out what was going on.  The author created situations without any explanation and many times I was left to wonder "how did that happen?"  In other sections of the book, the author seemed to drag on forever.  The longest subplot in the book seemed to be an odd take on Slavery in American and Colonial History.  It seemed out of place and more of a rant on black and white culture and relations.   This book was so odd that I never could figure out what the author was trying to accomplish in writing this book.  Of course, Williamson did leave an open ended ending which leads me to believe he was thinking of writing other books about the different subplots he created.  In the end, who knows?  All I know is that after reading this story I am not inclined to purchase another book from this author.   
 If I ever:  a) subject myself to this movie ever again  or  b) subject anyone else (including animals) to this movie  Form a mob and follow through with my wish in the title of this review.  Just one question that still haunts me...  How does Travolta's career survive this debacle and Pepper's hits the tank? 
 I bought this by mistake-thought I was buying book of same title by Lolly Winston...what a disappointment. These 20-something novels are something else...boo hoo hoo...life isn't perfect, but wait-then suddenly it is! Give me a break...I know it is fiction but don't readers want some real life in their books anymore?? Maybe not...that might require thinking.. 
 This book is alright if youd like to hear about what scientist rushed into the other ones office screaming. Or the life of Dr. Planck, and three hours later find out what the planck length is and what it,s used for. i personally want the facts and the information about the interesting subject that they use as their title. Not the history of why a world class scientist killed himself. To sum up it's a great book if you want a biography with the interesting stuff strewn about in many places so you have to search. although if you like a historical book then you may find it interesting 
 dfb sucks ,5 stars !!!! y all be kidding this is the worse album i ever heard .everybody is tired of leanin and rockin we all wanna reflect,think ,we need real music men with expression 
 Although as a Christian I agree with the principles in this book, one dissapointment is that the book is targeted towards only those who already agree with the author's point of view.  By making fun of opposing viewpoints, dismissing them without logically arguing against them, or simply stating his views without giving reasons, anyone who doesn't already agree with the author would be quickly alienated.  
 Roughneck Nine-One is Frank Antonori's account of ODA 391's operations in the early phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  SFC Antonori paints his team as a group of professional black sheep bucking the system all the way to the cold hills of Kurdistan in Iraq.  By his account, his ODA fought the good fight and inflicted the damage claimed however luck and good technology (the Javelin anti-tank missle) best explained the results of the engagement at Debecka, Iraq. By his own admission Antenori's team was surprised by the enemy. The author then commits the error of suggesting his team took on a mechanized enemy Task Force.  A Task Force is a technical term for a combined arms battalion size element (roughly 500-700 personnel).  What Antenori describes as his enemy was a company size element known as a "Team", a size designation far smaller in size than a Task Force.  Furthermore, his description of the friendly fire incident suggests that the fault may well of rested in the way the target was described to the pilot rather than in pilot error.  At no time in the description does Antenori ever suggest that his team provided an azimuth from their own position to that of the enemy.  At best, the Roughnecks were lucky more than skilled 
 I received the book, it was new, BUT IT WAS NOT HARDCOVER as "CAIMAN" said. So, I have to send it back, and I got a refund in my credit card 
 Dear God in Heaven . What a dreary little effort this is and what a disappointment after A Simple Plan . GReat idea for a very short story. Bad idea for a novel . In the end  ( if you can finish the tome ) you'll be rooting for the plant to do its darnest and quickly  
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 This book is from 1987, I briefly read the reviews saying that it wasn't in the digital era, OK I figured that's fine, how out of date could it be? However, I didn't expect that so much of the book would be dedicated to functionality that's now fully automatic, such as TTL Flash, and TTL exposure metering.   It's certainly a very interesting technical read, that provided me with an understanding of all the different macro options, lenses, filters, extensions, TC's, reversing rings, bellows, reverse mount adapters, lens stacking, etc. However, it wasn't for me.   I was after something that would show technique, or provide advice on how/where to find the shots he was taking, but the book doesn't cover that at all, to my dismay the book starts with the author writing "it always surprises me that folks find it hard to find subjects" but then provides no advice. After having bought a 60mm Micro lens I was hopeful this would provide direction, but other than "I probably should have bought the 105mm lens" I didn't get any direction from it.   
 The chapters are not of consistent strength or substance.  And then too, I came across a number of instances where statements were made without any attempt to support them with specific examples.  I cannot offer specifics instances of the aforementioned because I have already discarted the book.  This was required reading for a college course 
 My son was so excited for this toy.  It was all he asked for on his 8th birthday. We went out to the lake this week and then began our frustration.  First there is no way to launch this 30 feet unless the wind gusts and the moon and planets are alligned. Then the "safety" bobber is so safe it doesn't even open when it hits the water, but does cause such a large ripple in the lake that all fish are gone for hours. My son set it down after a hour of frustration and had me trek to the car to grab is old trusty fishing rod, that is not as colorful and plastic but does actually cast and catch fish. Don't get me wrong, I think the rod is a gret idea but the people who designed it did a very slipshoddy job, and I would warn anyone about spending money on it. 
 I bought this fridge two months ago. Now it stop running. I chose this one, because I expected it would be a quiet fridge and do its job. But it's not that quiet either.   This is my second Sharper Image item and it will be my last one 
 The concept is nice.  However, the authors use it as an excuse to give you countless cutsie small habits that they like in their own life.  Bathroom Yoga, Eye Exercises, etc.  It becomes barely coherent and quite annoying.    I can see how some people will like it.  There is so much in here that you are bound to find SOMETHING that you'd like.  But it's definitely not an "I-can't-put-it-down-it's-SO-good" book.  Perhaps most importantly, the small changes do NOT build upon each other to help you build an extraordinary life.  If that's what you want, A FAR better book is "One Small Step Can Change Your Life : The Kaizen Way" 
 I'm a big fan of Disney movies, and sappy-ness doesn't bother me, but this was off the scales corny. Not much story, too much dancing around. Kind of chilidish for grownups and hard for kids to understand some of it, as it's mostly about politics, so it kind of gets lost in the middle. Buddy Ebsen, though, gives his usual stellar performance, and Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn appear in the movie together and met on the set for the 1st time! 
 I'm over 30 and I have only heard of maybe 10% of the songs.  A lot from the 1930's and so forth.  Not a younger person's choice for pop music 
 I love Southern hip-hop. From Cunninlynguists to UGK; from Three Six Mafia to OutKast. Goodie MOb, T.I., Devin the Dude, Chamillionaire, Slim Thug, Young Buck..I've been known to rock with most hip-hop below the Mason-Dixon line. 8Ball and MJG are two individuals I've heard countless times on guest appearances, but never heard an entire album of material from. They're legends, of sorts, in the Southern region, and have inspired many of my favorite emcees today. It seems like that would fit snugly in my collection, but this album possibly turned me off of the Memphis duo for good.  It's not that 8Ball or MJG are particularily bad emcees. 8Ball's actually got a pretty interestesting flow, while MJG..well, to be completely honest, he doesn't bring much of anything to the table, other than counter-balancing 8Ball's husky, raw flow with nothing more than mediocrity. He's the Pimp C to 8Ball's Bun B, albeit not nearly as charismatic as the Pimpulation leader. Their lyrics are typical Southern fare, and I didn't expect anything more from them; to be totally up front with you, it wasn't 8Ball and MJG that turned me off of this album.  It was the horrible production. With Southern hip-hop, I've come to expect phat, and funky beats of very high quality; the production on these albums should be of the highest quality, and the budgets should be particularily large. Seeing and 8B&MJG are on Bad Boy, they should have more than enough money to get the Timbalands, Just Blazes, and Polow Da Dons of the music industry, but 8B&MJG get stuck with uninspired beats from Jazze Pha, Lil' Jon, and Hypnotized Minds, unknown producers, and a Timbaland-less Danja. It's obvious there was far too much Diddy involvement on this album, as it is certainly overly glossy. What surprises me is Yung Joc's album had a rawer sound musically than this, which is more proof that Diddy is trying to hard to make these two raw Southern emcees pop stars. If Diddy left this album alone, and left 8B&MJG be themselves, then it could've been a lot better.  There are some decent cuts, but they don't fill out nearly enough of the album to boost this score too much. When the beat's hot, such as on Clap On, 30 Rocks, Memphis, and Get Low, this album is deserving of all the publicity and promotion it got; however, the rest of the album falls below the line of mediocrity. 8Ball and MJG are by no means bad rappers, and I'm sure their older material is of much higher quality than this; I know their guest appearances were considerabley tighter than anything found on here. However, Ridin' High has soured my opinion on the duo, at least as long as they're on the Bad Boy imprint, and I'd recommend everyone, fan or not, to skip this album 
 I found it amazing that Fay Vincent tries to pass this off as a new idea.  Donald Honig already did this, and did it better.  Apparently, what the players said was transcribed verbatim, which made it difficult to read.  Additionally, most serious baseball fans have heard this all before.  Bobby Doerr and Johnny Pesky's stories were covered in detail in David Halberstam's The Teamates.  This is supposed to be the first of a series of books like this.  If so, this was the last one I purchased 
 I used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made, then I got a new bag (customer service was very nice and helpful) and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it (my stroller wasn't damaged), so I have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money, still waiting on a refund 
 Title is self explanatory, I'm very busy to write reviews but I needed to make this one, make sure nobody gets fooled by brand name , at medium prices and ultra low quality. I've bought a 5$ nobrand knife from TOP and is WAY better that this 
 The book, I'm sure, is well-intentioned, but overly simplistic and one-sided. On her website, Dr Kreidman even recommends her work as a replacement for marriage counseling for seriously troubled marriages. I have to whole-heartedly disagree, this is a dangerous notion. I purchased both the "his fire" and "her fire" books after reading all the wonderful reviews here, and the promises made on the author's website. I am unbelievably disappointed. As a woman who was just told by her husband that he wants an open marriage and is not attracted to me anylonger because I'm not in my early twenties anymore, I'm having trouble with the concept that I'm the one who should stroke his ego, plan sex-adventures, and never judge him, in order to win his love. That's pretty much the last thing I want to do. The author gives absolutely no validation to the woman's point of view, feelings, etc, she only talks about how the woman should adjust to the man's needs. Her suggestions might work to bring excitement into an otherwise dull, but functioning relationship, but when there is true heartbreak and years of anger and frustration involved, her suggestion to dress up like a hotel maid in order to turn on the husband is less than helpful. Good luck to everyone else! 
 We used a chapter from this book for my graduate Philosophy of mind class.  To be fair, I must note that I was not favorably disposed towards eliminative materialism to begin with (nor any other materialism, really).      My preference aside, though, I found at least this chapter (#2) to be  rife with misunderstandings of other fields like AI and neuroscience.  Even  when you are generous to Churchland's arguments, they often turn out to not  be arguments at all.  Granted, issues like materialism, mentalism, and  dualism are difficult to find solid ground on.  What I object to is that he  portrays as crystal clear arguments which aren't even logical, even if you  grant his premises are true (which they often aren't).  Obviously I can't  give an in-depth criticism here, but I have a short paper on the topic.     Anyways, you may want to find a more complete and more careful text.  It  succeeded in provoking thought, but I was dissapointed in the quality of  the author's thought 
 Cruel, horrible story with a typical Barr convoluted plot. The abuse of children, evil ranger poising as a dead ranger, freaky religious sect, dead animals on the bed, and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me. I've read many Barr books, and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters, it's hard to keep them straight. In this book, that was the last of my worries. I didn't even finish it, I was so turned off 
 I wanted to like this book more than I did, but I just found a lot of it to be, like, lame! Savan has some good points but she repeats herself so much, drowning every sentence in 'pop words' that offset other 'pop words' reminding her of even more 'pop words', that large parts of the book are a convoluted mess! Much of the ground has been covered elsewhere, in greater detail, and in less headache-inducing style! I did find some interesting nuggets, but had to skim through a lot of tedious material to get there. Fans of language should check it out if they're curious. People who can do without socio-political commentary should skip it 
 I personally believe Dr. Dyson has the best interest of black folk at heart. I really do. However, I think he is misguided and I am not impressed by him. I admit I did not finish the book. Once he began his personal attacks on Mr. Cosby I left it alone.   Bill said what many of us say in private. Period. You can argue that he picked the wrong time and place, but the message is the right one. Maybe he did not say it as nicely as he could have, but it is still the truth.   At the end of the day there are way too many writers and speakers trying to pass themselves off as leaders. Leaders lead, writers write, and speakers talk. The sad thing about it is so many of our people incorrectly accept these people as leaders. There are too many people trying to tell us what to think and not enough showing our people what to do. While Dyson beats Cosby down personally I ask what should some of these young brothers do to better their situation?   There are basically two kinds of people in this world. You either look for people and things that confirm what you think to be true. Or you look for people and things that will reveal the truth rather it confirms what you thought or turns it on its head. At this time our people need the truth, not more pandering.   
 We don't have our baby yet  -but have tried the tub to see if it works.  The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it.  this second one the spa works but the shower doesn't.  The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor.  Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money 
 This brief review covers both the Feb'45 (volume I) and the Mar-Apr'45 (volume II) booklets.  Okay the editors promo calls it a concise diary of Unteroffizier Eduard Bodenmuller amongst many other things. Until I read it I didn't realise just how concise things were to be and how little of any of the other details would be included.  So as a result I shall keep the review in the same manner  The diary notes are generally dry and unemotional, but they do give the idea on the intensitity of fighting, causalities and supply problems due to the daily tally of rearming each day. Do not expect a "Sven Hassel" style book on combat.   There are several line drawings and B & W photographs, but none of which appear to be from new sources and in fact most of the photographs and line drawings are repeated in the second volume.  Basically while these two small booklets fill another small niche of recording history they are sadly lacking in very much detail and have truely missed out on educating .  I just wish there had been a review to read prior to my purchase of the two booklets so I could have saved my money. 
 This was a hugely disappointing film. I did not see it on stage nor do I want to if it is ever resurrected. It trivializes illness, death, God, heaven, range of human emotion and love in all forms. I have grown up in a post-AIDS world and can see so many problems far worse than AIDS.I am tired of listening to actors drone on in selfish pursuits. While America focuses on such banal subject matter, larger more urgent problems are clearly ignored by a society that thinks it has the luxury of still trying to come to grips with sexuality 
 Please do yourself a favor and read the book rather than listen to this audio version.  The narrator, who speaks with a modern West-coast accent, is the absolute wrong choice for this funny, charming story set in the early 1900's.  Peck's humor is nearly lost in this monotone reading 
 This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant "homemaker". If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too 
 The compositions, Rhythms and singin-style of Peter Cetera sound always the same. He is a typical sappy love song - singer who prefers the love ballads and cheesy love adventures. it might have been a bit tedious and boring.  The problem is everywhere: If you are a Hardrock fan like bands Uriah Heep, Stevie Ray Vaughan, AC/DC, Rory Gallagher, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, your ears can't be familar with all these silly love songs. My ears cannot work like that.  there are two alternatives: - if you are a hardrock fan. You like a mythological lyrics, you won't like Peter Cetera or Chicago. Keep your fingers away from this !!! - if you are a sappy love song fan then please buy this cd !! 
 I'm not sure why this magazine is so highly rated. Sure it's an O.K. magazine, if you like immersing yourself in hype, marketing-speak and incredibly superficial language. Admittedly the pictures are pretty and as an obsessed mountain biker i can say we like bike porn. I just cannot read any of the articles. Chock full of over-the-top adjectives and 'xtreme' language. I don't trust a magazine that calls every new incremental advancement in biking technology 'revolutionary' or 'amazing' or any number of disgustingly inappropriate modifiers. They ceaselessly use vapid 'technical' jargon made up to sound high-minded and high-tech, but is nothing more than marketing spew.  The tech advice column is full of suspicious letters that have the stench of stealth advertising. If there's one thing that's well thought-out about this magazine, it's how best to bombard the reader with sales pitches, half-truths and hype.  In short, this magazine is blatant industry propaganda. My first advice: don't buy it. If you do buy it (for the love of god) don't take anything between those covers seriously. 
 THIS ALBUM IS OKAY NOT THEIR BEST. A FEW SONGS ARE GOOD OTHER THAN  THAT THIS ALBUM  IS FAIR.PURCAHSE IT WITH YOUR MONEY INTELLIGENTLY!!!!!!!! 
 King certainly lends a high-profile to this collection of latter-day noir writing and tough-guy procedurals, but I believe he created something a little too far outside the readership's expected genre for this series. The setting and characters are recognizable (now trite?) staples of his beloved Maine coast, and he works at bringing their "down east" mannerisms to life with language that rings of "Bert & I" lobstermen. I wasn't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach. And the ending ... well, um ... the ending is definitely an open-ender. King cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won't appeal to many readers. Yep. You got that right, Stephen. No gunplay, no boozers, no saucy dames, no double-crosses, no slangy patter, no real satisfaction for me. I suggest Hard Crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy-hitters from the past 
 First off, not all the stories were horrible, but I kept finding myself asking, "These were the best short stories they could find?  Really?"  Half of them didn't make much sense--you know the kind of stories that are all style and no substance.  You reach the end and feel like the author just wasted your time.  
 I read the first two chapters, scanned the rest, and decided not to waste any more time; there are too many good books to read. The premise of the writer (de Becker) is that intuition is correct where rational thought fails. He tells the stories of the lady who was attacked in a dark parking lot, the lady whose boy died during an operation, and the one whose son was getting a lot of attention from a pervert. In every case the lady had reason to fear for her or her boy's safety before a bad thing happened. To de Becker, each tale is proof that intuition was right and reason went wrong. The author does not cite his sources, but makes it clear that he is the world's foremost consultant, and gets these stories from people who attend his lectures and TV appearances (on Oprah!). The book might be better if it was all stories, but it is padded out to 321 pages with a lot of hot air. It never happens that anyone is taken by surprise, or has an unfounded suspicion. Becker gives us a slanted, unbalanced view, in trying to ratify the bold claims on the book jacket (how to know if every person your child will ever meet is a threat). The evidence is cooked. The thesis must be rejected. I offer the alternate hypothesis that de Becker pads his pockets selling bogus books to gullible parents. 
 what a waste.if your new great buy it. if not a total rehash of basics.i was quite dis appointed 
 If you're looking for a dumb book to waste your time with, then this book is just the ticket. You'll notice that the author's friends in the "self-help/success" book industry all gave the book 5 stars, but people who actually bought the book say it sucks.  The self-help industry is, unfortunately, largely populated with individuals who are less than perfectly honest. They ALWAYS give each other' books super-great reviews, thereby scratching each other's backs so that they all can sell more books and make more money.   When one reads these reviews with a critical eye, one notices that they often don't say anything very specific about the book itself, which is usually a strong indicator that the reviewer hasn't actually read the book. You'll notice that most of the information contained in these reviews can be gleaned from glancing at the books table of contents, and sometimes the review focuses on the author without really describing the book at all. These also are telltale signs that the reviewer hasn't read the book.  In closing, this guy has published a whole series of similar books which purport to tell everyone how to be successful in life and handle any situation. What makes this guy an authority on life? Try reading one of his books & you will find the answer to that question. He isn't an authority on anything. He's just a guy with a lot of time on his hands whose trying to make a living without having to actually work 
 I recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon.  It is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent, however, the unit would only work using the S video connector, not separate connections.  the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud 
 Wonderful prose -- use of language 
 When I ordered this book, I assumed it would have been written by a Jewish author and Published by a Jewish company.  I am sadly mistaken. It comes from a Christian publishing company and the author is Christian.  I havn't read the book yet and will be leary of details.  I would like to see better representation of books about Biblical characters. 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 After reading a dozen of books on "Art history" following the standard chronological order, I strongly desired to read this book showing a different perspective. However, my disappointment surpassed my expectances. The problem of this book is that it simply gives very little, too general information without developing any subject in more detail. Each chapter (devoted to a particular genre) is further divided by topic. For instance, the "religious painting" chapter speaks about "representation of the virgin Mary", "representation of Christ", etc. Up to this point, "a nice idea" you may think. But now, let me explain that each one of these topics is explained and depicted in (always) two pages. Approximately one page corresponds to writing and one page to images (this, statistically speaking for the book does not follow such a distribution). Imagine! What can be said about any topic -for instance, representation of "the Pasion"- in just one page of information?! And even worse, the book is supposed to be also chronological comprenhensive!!! If you are looking for a book that explains the evolution of each genre, then this is not the correct choice. There is no analysis at all. Just a kind of introduction to the subject (with poor intelectual intention) and some pictures (chosen with unknown criteria) to produce a colourful page. Honestly, I would like other reviewers give some examples to support the high rate given to this work.  Regarding the chosen paintings, not only the criteria for the selection is unclear (if it exists at all for it does not seem to be consistent throughout the book) but -more important and objective- is that many of the illustrations are so small that one cannot appreciate important details.To say it in a sentence: the worse book I have ever read on art history. To whom might this book be beneficial? To the editors, I guess 
 This picturemate has been a total disaster.  After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow.  Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again. Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image, but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT 
 I would like to point out to my fellow readers that this book is not a "how to" book.  If you think that this book will teach you  how to use alternative medicine to heal, think again.  This is a reference book, pure and simple.  For example, in the chapter dedicated to massage, one might have expected to learn how to give someone a massage.  But, instead, you are given everything else but that information.  You get a short history of massage, some of the benefits, and places to go for more information.  If you think that this book will teach you how to use the methods described in the table of contents, think again.  This is a reference book, like a dictionary.  You get definitions, history, and references for more informatoin, but you do not get a how to lesson.  If you want to be able to look up data on a new age healing method you heard about on the news, then buy this book.  But, if you are looking for a book that tells you how to use those methods, keep looking for another book 
 I'm sorry but women dont belong in the field. I am an avide hunter and my wife was given this book by her friend. I read the first few chapters and the last one and skimmed the rest. It seems to me to be weird feminist Lorraine Bobbitt propanganda, I dont want to think of girls out there in the woods when Im withmy buddies. They would onlybe a distraction and scare the  toms and cussies since they talk to much! Anyway, I highly recommend Ted Nugents books insteadof this one expecially if you want to keep the wife at home where she belongs 
 The first Farseer book impressed me with its great writing and interesting characters. The second book, though not as great, was still a solid sequel. This third Farseer book is a mess (see Kaymin's comments). The 757 page book (paperback version) should have been edited to fewer than 500 pages. A few of the ill-considered, disjointed plot lines also should have encountered the delete key.   What could not be repaired are some of the idiotic key elements such as the fact that no one remembered that the ancient race who helped the citizens of Buck were actually dragons that exist as stone statues until imbued with the memories, souls, and lives of multiple humans. What the heck? And somehow, the protagonist, FitzChivalry, continues to make the same stupid mistakes he did as a teenager and still manages to survive. Of the main characters, only his wit-bonded wolf made reliably sensible decisions.  Given the flaws described above, I am astonished by the many five star reviews of this book. I believe that fans of the first two books were overly generous to this one 
 Both "Proofs" and Barrel's work on the French Revolution fell into disrepute and were considered--even proven--hoaxes.  Nonetheless, groups like the John Birch society and its sister ideologies continue to preach it like gospel 
 Looking at the title of this book, I thought it was a question. "Don't Know Much About Geography? (well pick up this handy guide and I'll teach you everything you need to know about the world but never learned)". Don't get me wrong, that's not why I bought it at all- I was assigned to read this book (so take this review with a grain of salt). As I read this book, I began to realize that the title is more of a statement. As in, "YOU Don't Know Much About Geography (you stupid fool so let me put it to you very frankly)". I found this book to be very remedial, rather than eye opening. There was only one time I remeber when I was amazed by the information presented to me- and I can't remeber that single fact, so what's the use. Davis spells out planets names, defines "state" and "nation", facts people need to know (I suppose), but he does it with a fourth grade humor that makes it seem like you are being talked down to. It reads quickly, is packed with information, but all around this book is not as funny as some say it is and at times is like being back in the grade school class that Davis describes in his introduction. I guess that's the point, but where is the imagination in a dressed up encyclopedia about geography? Read it if you have to or you liked the rest of the other "Don't Know Much About" series, otherwise don't bother. It is not much of a referance book either with many facts hidden behind his "get-to-the-point-already" paragraphs, although it does have an extensive index 
 If you have never written a successful grant before or are primarily involved in raising funds for social services this book will likely be of help.  However, for the rest of us it has little to offer. The book is narrowly focused on procedures one must follow before, during and after the grant writing process, but it fails to discuss writing strategies to enhance persuasiveness or improve the presentation of complicated technical subjects. I found it useless 
 This Canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out, on a 1080p monitor.  I have used other HDV format cameras, and they were much better. The low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain.  If you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light, but still plauged in low light 
 Long ago, a friend who raved about "The Invisibles" loaned me this first book. I don't have very clear memories of it, but I remembered it as being very hard to read, and I remember not getting very far in it before I lost interest.  Recently, due specifically to the influence of Warren Ellis's awesome series "Planetary", I've gotten interested in comics again, and decided to give "The Invisibles" a second try. I got a little further this time, but still didn't even make it past the first volume.  The story seems promising; "Big Brother is Watching, So Make Yourself Invisible". The eponymous team are a gang of reality-bending Crowley-style sorcerors, fighting the mundane system of everyday life, and the sinister otherworldly monsters who control the mundane system of everyday life. The execution, however, is less than ideal. MOST of the pages are very jarringly non-sequential; on one page, the characters will be in a park, listening in on a conversation, and then on the next page, where you expect to find a continuation of the conversation they were listening to, they'll suddenly be walking along a riverbank, in the middle of their own completely different and unrelated conversation. On almost every single page I had to turn back, and check the page numbering to make sure I hadn't accidentally skipped something or pages hadn't fallen out of the book; if it weren't for the sequential page numbering, I would have assumed I was reading a bad printing. This could be a clever technique if used sparingly; in a comic book about "hacking reality", throwing in a sudden and unexpected "jump cut" between two pages can contribute greatly to the reader's immersion in the "reality hacking", but when it's done on every other page it loses that hook and just feels sloppy, like the author and artist didn't know how to structure a comic.  One of the "page cuts" jumps from the beginnings of a fairly realistic fight scene to a super-bright, psychedelic scene in which a character is tripping out and talking to the ghost of John Lennon, which looks like a completely different comic, has completely different pacing and artwork, and is FILLED with meaningless text, which brings us to my next problem with "The Invisibles": there's WAY too much meaningless text. If you want to present a radical, reality-altering concept in your comic, that's great; try to do it with action as much as possible and with as few words as possible -- this is a visual medium, after all. If you need to throw in a few wordy bits, that's OK too ("Planetary", again, does a perfect job of this). If, however, you are filling ENTIRE PAGES with text so small that you have to go below standard comic font size and it becomes illegible, then you might want to re-think your medium and perhaps just write a book, or a really wordy animation, instead. It was after the third ENTIRE page of nothing but hard-to-read, handwritten, meaningless text that I gave up on "The Invisibles". And by "meaningless" I don't mean "fluff dialogue that pertains to the action" or "cryptic dialogue that might make sense later", I mean actually meaningless, gigantic word-bubbles of insane characters singing entire songs and babbling incoherently about things that have nothing to do with the plot, or meaningless stream of consciousness droning from characters who are tripping. All of this text feels like nothing but filler, and coupled with the jarring transitions between pages it makes "The Invisibles" look like VERY amateur work.  One last niggling detail is that I couldn't really identify with any of the characters. The main character, a teenage boy named "Dane", is basically a carbon-copy of Alex from "A Clockwork Orange", but without the interest in Beethoven. He wanders around London with his monosyllable-named "droogs", indiscriminately stealing cars, smashing windows, beating people up, and blowing up buildings. It's suggested that he's very smart, but this doesn't make him any more likeable. The "hook" is that he "sees dead people", which might've been clever when this series was first printed, but after "The 6th Sense", "Bleach", and a dozen other stories with "I see dead people" protagonists, it just seems clichï¿½d.  I really wanted to get the same sort of "reality warping" experience out of "The Invisibles" that some of my friends have, but I've seen it done better a dozen times before, and the whole execution just seems amateur. When I stopped reading it, I was hungry for some REAL reality warping, so I sat down and read some stories out of the collected fictions of Jorge Luis Borges and felt MUCH better. I suggest you skip "The Invisibles" and do the same.  Addendum: The friend who last loaned it to me told me that the first two story arcs were, indeed, horrible, but that it got significantly better after them. I tried reading it again, skipping over those first two story arcs and starting from the third, and it was indeed a much better read, and nothing was lost in having not read that first part. So, I'm upgrading my review to "a fun read overall, but not something I'd be interested in owning" 
 Where do I begin?  Let's define the humor - crass, tactless, gross, inane, all come to mind.  If you are an adult that enjoys the lowest of lowest humor that includes profanity for profanity's sake, death and dismemberment, that type of garbage, then this book is for you.  I think having a humor book on bigfoot is a grand idea, but in my view, humor should transcend across all ages of readers to be humorous, not the gutter type humor this author conveys.  Think Calvin and Hobbes, funny to kids, funny to adults, not trying to be offensive to get a lift out of the reader, as this book does.  Complete disappointment 
 We selected this book for our discussion group this month.  And I started reading it several days ago.  The first half of the book went slowly; it was confusing and uninteresting.  The second half picked up with some tension and interest.  And the ending just triumphed with sadness and melancholy feelings.  I watched the Patriot/Broncos game while reading the story.  And the storyline followed the game 
 The good:  the massage function works fine, no problems with the performance, and the battery holds a good charge.  The bad:  how much money is saved in construction by using the  cheapest foam padding imaginable?   The ugly: the 'pebbled vinyl' material on the arms is already separating after six months.  Maybe a cheaper material could have been found...but I doubt it.  Overall good in theory, but very poor in execution.  If some real quality were put into the product, it would rate potentially 5 stars.  'Til then,you've been warned.... 
 The author freely reinterprets scripture to suit his agenda, without any convincing logic to support his assumptions.  I was unable to endure much of this book in spite of my desire to really understand an apposing view.  In my opinion, it's just another attempt to invent a social gospel rather than to accept the gospel of salvation 
 I was not nearly as enamored with this book as most of the reviewers below. The biggest problem for me is that Alice simply was not a sympathetic character. She whines and excuses her bad behavior all the way through. She also covers up for and excuses the deplorable behavior of her near-do-well son. The only sympathetic character was the husband, who I sided with and felt extremely sorry for throughout the entire story. Her trips to the shrink are boring and add little to the story. I also thought that Alice was ridiculously over dramatic about the "secret" from her childhood she finally remembers, and overly dramatic about the death of her parents, as if she is the only person in the world who has ever suffered these experiences. Woe is me! Sounded like a pity party to me. All and all, not a winning story line, although the writing itself was really good. Perhaps I'll try one of her previous books and see if the story is better. 
 Ehhh, well here goes... some of this is decent. I say that with a fair amount of self-consciousness since Staind isn't really taken that seriously these days - and rightfully so. But Dysfunction, for all its cliche nu metal-ness, has a unique gritty atmosphere and some decent tunes.  Early Staind is radio post-grunge crossed with a third rate Korn immitation, but it does have its charms. The guitarist borrows heavily from Korn's impressionistic chord-writing. Unlike a lot of radio bands these days, they didn't bury that strength (and the band's tone in general) under layers of sickeningly sweet production. In fact much of this record gets by on its sound rather than its songwriting. It seethes with frustration and the band have a good feel for each other.  I can't say Aaron Lewis's lyrics "seethe" with anything, unfortunately. They're mostly whiney mommy and daddy stories and his melodies aren't even that strong. This is another department in which Staind shamelessy robs their Korn forefathers blind. Lewis seems to have missed the point in Jonathan Davis's lyrics, seeing in his spit and bile an excuse to cry and moan. At the same time, the woe-is-me act does sort of add to the comedy of Staind in general.  It has some solid and catchy tunes, such as "Just Go", "Mudshovel" and "Home", and the rest is peppered with decent and occasionally inspired guitar riffs. The song structures are often haphazard and wander off track in uninteresting ways, but the vibe maintains throughout. It does what it does pretty well 
 It would at least meant that I cared one way or another what was happening when reading it 
 This book will drive you insane...the directions are extremely hard to understand.  The focus of the book is on mindless duplication of ugly projects instead of learning the tools to create.  The focus on detail in the step by step directions is maddening (go to pixel located at x234 y250 and click mouse button three times)    This book is a actually harmful to the learning process  Avoid it 
 The Philosophy states on their cosmetic's containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin. Well, this is for sure true, when you use this Kit Kit. I have pictures to proove, that for more than a month of using Acne Kit Kit not even one acne spot dissapeared. I'm combining it with oxygen peel- this doesn't help either. I was as happy as young horse to have all this products for around $40: night and day cream, facial wash and blemish serum. All they do ( maybe except of the wash) is drying out the skin. Soon I have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream( my skin started showing dark, sun-exposure spots, altough I WAS USING an spf filter) and finally no acne was or is gone. I dont get it- I was having better results using $0,97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line of cosmetics. For the same price I could have bought stuff that really works-the one that Vanessa Williams is happy with. I know cause I tried it, didn't make my skin feel like Sahara and will be my next choice. Save your money. P.S. The oxygen peel is O.K. dough 
 Well, since this book has gotten nothing but 5 stars, I'm sure this review will get a lot of "stones thrown at it."  I was quite disappointed within the first 20 minutes of reading this book.  While I think the authors were on the right path, this book went off the "right path" in so many ways.   * I bought this book because I am having a problem and I need a solution.  I was already frustrated about my condition, yet having to go through page after page of general education information was of no help.    * All the medical and scienfific "gibberish" should have been confined to appendices in the back, as should all the letters to other health care professionals.    * The little quotes stuck throughout the book were very distracting!  * The assessment tests should have been right at the very beginning.  This would have involved *ME* in the book quite early on, providing a feeling that someone did understand my problem and I was getting a hold of the situaton.  Instead, they are buried in the book.   * The book should have been divided into individual types once identified: Phoebe, Meredith, and Emily - instead of trying to make it appear they were "friends" working through a problem.   * I think my major issue was the pushng of locations for testing and such.  I got the feeling that the authors were out to gain more by pushing me to take these non-main stream tests. Between that and their subtle digging at doctors, that was the final straw that made me decide to send the book back for refund - a first for me.   I think there are other books out there that do a much better job of helping woman who are having these types of problems, just as I feel there are doctors who have this same awareness.  
 The book is well readable but it is more like a soap novel than the previous, more historical, Love and War. It seems written in a hurry. Pity 
 Not insightful, not even humorous. I am willing to admit that maybe I just don't get his writing style, whatever that might be. I hope Mr. Rakoff gets into a new line of wor 
 This book is about a young girl named Mary and her friend. It takes place in Northern France during the time the Nazis were occupying France. The kids don't care about the war until a group of Jewish children running away from the Nazis come to their house with two Nazis soldier hot on their trail. The Jewish children have to hide. Will the Nazis find them? Will Mary and her friends betray them for a bribe?  I give this book one star. I thought that the plot was a little boring and childish. I recommend this book for people who like a easy read.   
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 The box set made by IMAGE (not ELITE) does not have all of the technical  problems that Paul Kesler wrote of in his review 
 This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.    I gave it two stars because, for the two months it worked, it worked well, however, now, it won't work at all.  And as the other reviewer stated, support is nearly non-existant 
 I bought this thermometer and liked it but after I used it a few times the buttons stopped working and I couldn't turn it off. I opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it. A bath thermometer should at least be waterproof 
 Unfortunately this is a poor book, and if you are a busy person I would recommend you find something else, something that is well organised instead.   This book had poor organisation, lots of grammatical errors, and a ton of verbose blather with not much meaty info, and badly failed my signal to noise ratio test.  It would be possible to strip two thirds of the words out by reformatting concisely, as well taking out all the times the authors say 'as we are showing you'. I would certainly have appreciated it much more if they had been concise, as my time is precious.   I purchased this book along with charles petzolds 'Application = Code + Markup" and 'Essential WF', and both are excellent books. They are the standard I expect from 'professional' programming books, particularly ones with Pro in the title! They had a concise and structured presentation, good editiorial proofing and grammar, and gave me insight I could not easily get from MSDN.   To the authors: sorry to give your book a bad rap, but it's true and you can produce better work, I'm sure of it. Also, you should get a good editor, who will catch grammatical errors, and stop you being self indulgent and bring your focus back to what the readers want, which is not to hear you say hundreds of time 'as we are showing you'! 
 I received a novelty: A book without text!!!!!!!!!!!! Completely blank, except for the front and back cove 
 Lennon once made a comment to the effect that every two-bit hack associated with the Beatles would eventually get one book out of the deal, and in this case Kane is already on number two. Don't waste your time; if you want a real page-turner that brings up truly new insights, check out "The Beatles" by Bob Spitz, which is extremely insightful and well writen. I'm going to sell my copy of Kane's book: anyone interested 
 I was dismayed to discover Walker's acidic tone towards the Judeo-Christian religious tradition in this book. She seems to think that the fact that many Jewish and Christian symbols happen to have origins in Pagan cultures is somehow discrediting to Christianity and Judaism. In this and in some of her other writings, she makes it clear to the reader that it is her opinion that Judaism and Christianity are nothing more than a bastardized form of pseudo-Paganism in which the role of the woman has been subordinated. Merely because Judaism and Christianity borrow heavily from Pagan tradtions does not mean that they are not valid forms of spirtuality. It is all well and good to be proudly Pagan, but it is entirely unacceptable to denigrate other religions to be so. A true scholar must be strive to be as objective and unbiased as possible in their work, and Walker fails spectacularly in this respect. I do not reccommend this book to anyone, as Walker's blatant bias makes me highly suspicious of her scholarship, and my suspicions seem to be confirmed by other reviewers. 
 I have enjoyed previous financial books by Mr. Stein and his television appearances on financial programs as well as his appearance on Seinfeld.  Mr. Stein seems insightful, knowledgeable and personable.  However his self help book that I am reviewing now I found to be shallow in depth.  One cannot find happiness by deciding what you want  and obtaining it for the same reason a child only finds temporary pleasure in a new toy until he/she gets bored with it. Finding fulfillment in life is more complex and more meaningful than this book discusses.   I would probably be for Mr. Stein sticking to finance and comedy; self help is not his talent in the opinion of this reviwer 
 On paper, the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea, and upon first glance of it, it seems like it's firing on all cylinders.  Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles (Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Elisa Cuthbert, etc.) and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show, 24: The Game falls apart once you get further into it.  The missions are repetitive, the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched, and the controls are unresponsive to say the least.  Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks, but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you.  Some of this could be forgiveable, but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels.  It's a shame too, considering how innovative the series was in it's early life and everything the game had going for it.  If more polish was put into it, 24: The Game could have been something special, but as it is, it's only recommended as a rental for fans of the series 
 The advertisement picture shows the cover below the top of the wheels.  The cover I received was a full 3 inches above the top of the wheels and left the bottom storage rack fully exposed to the weather 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 Jeez, maybe I am getting old, but I really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest.    A brilliant scientist.  Disfigured.  Angry.  Finds temporary techie fix for face.  Goes to get bad guys.  Fighting.  More fighting.  Still more fighting.  Ex mate learns he's alive.  He leaves her anyway (he's too ugly).  The end.  More to come, if successful.  Not recommended 
 I recently bought an armload of the prettiest fuschia pink Debblie Bliss silk aran yarn, and had been waiting by my mailbox with much anticipation for my new aran pattern treasury to arrive to put my sassy pink yarn to good use.  Alas, what was advertised and what arrived were two different things: for starters, none of the patterns in this book look the slightest bit "aran."    This book contains a variety of progressive celtic braids and anglo-saxon knaughts, but if this were what I was looking for, I would've purchased "Viking Knits" (yes, this is a real book) instead.  Gone were the popcorns, baubles, and cables many of us associate with the aran sweters grandma knitted for us in childhood, or relatives lovingly returned with from holidays in the British Isles.... Instead, these seem to be replaced with intricate sweaters that are intricate-- well, solely for the sake of being intricate.  These knits aren't pretty, they're "clunky," and many of them look as if someone simply borrowed a few creations from Cliff Huxtable's wardrobe, dropped them into a vat of bleach, then replaced all the clashing patterns and hideous colors with knitted features and topography to re-create the original cacaphony of creativity.    Many of these items feature "sack" shaping, with ribbed necklines, ribbed hems, and wribbed sleeve openings.  Think Mr. Potatohead in a cotton-woolblend with braiding, and you have the standard creation from "Arans & Celtics."  Granted, any intermediate knitter can change such minor finishing details, but I'd only be willing to change those touches were the patterns worth knitting in the first place!  As it was, I took the book out, flipped thru, & realized that, if I were to knit a single item, the only person I could even consider giving it to with a straight face was my 80-some-odd year old grandmother, and lord knows, she's not going to be into wearing my Debbie Bliss fuschia!  I kinda had something for myself in mind with that find, and was looking to do a traditional aran-- with rolled necklice, open sleeves, and an un-clingy hemline-- with a twist of bright color and silk-blend yarn.  As it was, there wasn't a single pattern to work something like this from, nor was there a single celtic-work knitting pattern I could borrow and customize.  Needless to say, highly disappointed, esp given the cost.  I'm packing it back up and sending it back as soon as I finish this review!  I'll be checking out modifying a celtic/ aran I saw in the "Knits for Men" book and seeing what I can't do to make that one workable for a small-ish woman's frame instead!    
 i ordered this book to give me some ideas and decorating tips, what i got are pictures of old flea market items, that have nothing to do with each other. didn't help a bit, and truthfully if it didn't cost so much to return, i'd return it in a second 
 Why would Amazon want me to review an order that they didn't fill?  I would LOVE to review this item - how can I get it???? I've been waiting since December for it, and was told last week, the back order will not be filled 
 After reading the book I have to say it did not meet my expectations at all. Sorry! From the title, you would expect something like a (light) version of the SAS hand-to-hand fighting manual, currently used by the SAS to prepare its soldiers for possible self-defense situations. This is absolutely not the case!  The main connection between the book and SAS is more or less the author's former employment as an SAS instructor!  The book includes some general tips for civilians on how to prevent getting into possible conflicts but they are mostly psychological. The book also includes some self-defense techniques but it would be risky to base your safety just on them.  The author indicates that these techniques can be practiced at home, but, for example, warm-up exercises are completely missing. In addition many techniques are described in one or two pictures, which is not really sufficient for correctly understanding the involved movements. The explanations for these techniques are kept rather short. Overall I have to say that the book should be called ""Everyday Conflict Prevention and modified SAS Self-defense techniques for Civilians" or something like it because that would give readers a much better understanding of what they can expect for their money.  Don't expect too much - the title sounds great but that's more or less it!!! 
 I read all 33 of the other reviews here to get other perspectives - a lively debate.  There were so many brilliant things said about the film, that I found myself passing out "Helpful" votes (to both positive & blisteringly negative reviews) like they were candy.  The movie is an evocative work of art.  I encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view.  I agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers, but I will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned.  The DVD cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers, a sort of "Blue Lagoon" from the Renaissance.  It is not.  It is misleading.  I concede a) the story is probably not historically accurate, b) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition, & c) Tossi was probably inconsiderate, conceited, and immoral.  But the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters.  Having said that, I do object that the movie, according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available, is not just inaccurate, but oppositional to what probably occurred.  Therefore, I critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person.  The movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional (or incorrect) causal factors.  And those cause-effect relationships don't seem to ring true.  Having said that, I agree with some of Richard Burt's review comments that "historical accuracy" may still be subject to interpretation.  It is reasonable that Artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial (defending her freedom and reputation) than she might have been with Tassi personally.  And it seems too easy to just paint Tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done.  There is usually more complexity and diverse/conflicting interests in most people, especially artists.  One strong objection - near the end of the film, Artemisia says, "No one dies of sorrow."  While there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment, the line frustrated me.  People DO die of sorrow.  My limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest, most sensitive, artistic, and caring people I've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow.  And the people I have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow.  Not selfish, controlling, or passive-aggressive sorrow, but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations - often unidentified & misunderstood misconceptions.  Sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit, character, the soul, & creativity.  Sorrow is not incidental.  Sorrow can destroy health.  Or as the Angel of America in "Angels in America" says, "The body is the garden of the soul."  Sorrow is worth full attention.  The movie tries to examine the effect of Artemisia's loyalties to her father and her teacher.  The screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply "good" or "bad"; both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on Artemesia.  Her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression.  They work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts.  At the same time, they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices, privacy, and pacing beyond her desired level of influence.  Artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father's drive and design.  At the same time, she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in - in polite society.  May your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find.  And may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties.  Compare Caravaggio's "Judith Beheading Holofernes" to Artemisia's version of the same painting.  Her version is more violent, realistic (less idealized in posing, dirtiness, lighting, etc.).  Her version has the female servant actively helping Judith.  Artemisia's paintings show a palpable understanding of hate, violence, sexuality & compassion.  Artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best.  That's why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately - because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 I was encouraged to buy this book by all of its positive reviews, but was disappointed to find it to be almost completely useless for me. First, our training seminars are reasonably well established: I was looking to better "market and promote" them, as the title of the book says. Unfortunately there are only 2 or 3 pages on this subject in the entire book, and they are little more than recommendations to buy the books & tapes from other promoters that the author works with.  This book does not provide helpful information so much as it plugs the author's many other products that promise to do so. It reads like a self-help book from the 1990's.  I was looking for a professionally presented source of good usable information (something that we provide in our seminars) but instead got a hard lesson on used car salesmanship 101. I am confident that those who leave my seminars got their money's worth, but I expect that Fred Gleeck makes a lot more money at his. Two different ways of doing business, I guess 
 Major themes in Missing May will be of concern to some parents, yet are not easy to discern from the book's summaries. The characterizations are good. There are moments that might help a reader be more sympathetic towards people who look or act in a way that seems odd to them.   However, in the spiritual realm, there is much to entice readers into the "Church" of Spirituality, the occult, seeking answers with mediums and more. This bundle of confusion is all wrapped in a Newbery award winner which will be on every required reading list throughout the land.   There are parents who would not wish their children to have these issues painted in a positive light, or would like to discuss these things with their children in the light of their own values, but who do not have a clue about the content judging from the book summary. The Newbery award will make it even more likely that unsuspecting parents will have their children read this book, unaware of any conflict with their beliefs.    
 I bought this book the day it came out.  Dennis Lehane is one of my top 5 favorite authors.  What a letdown.  He is so talented I will buy his next book the day that it comes out, however this one does not showcase his talent.  
 The transfer to digital format from the analog source includes all of the tape hiss on this disc.  The content is great, but the background noise is too much on my system.  I'd look for another title from OP and pass on this one.  
 I am conservative on most issues but I do have some problems with our strategies in the Iraq war.  I have a very liberal friend who is in love with the term "Neocon".  He is constantly critizing me for reading "right wing" propaganda so I said I would give his idea of a great book a try.  I read a little over half of the book and I couldn't take it anymore.  I found myself dreading getting back to the book each day, to me this is just a liberal antiwar hit piece.  There are some good questions in the book on our strategies and troop deployment.  But the author's hate of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Rice take over and cloud every chapter.  He makes the Neocons sound like Dr. Evil's Chamber in the Austin Powers movies.  His referencing was always from the far left blogs and publications, he constantly referenced conversations that could never be substantiated.  My friend told me this was a historical book, apolitical, I think not.  Read it if you want to, I couldn't get through it.  Ann Coulter is an idealogue, but at least she is funny 
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters (lefties) have deleted this review Twice.  Robert Reich, was Bill Clintons scariest appointment. His ideology, ergo his politics has been the of the most extreme left of any Bill Clinton's appointments. And some may argue that he some of the most extreme viewpoints of ANY high level appointment.   Robert Reich and his ilk were very happy when from the 1940's - 1980, radical lefties was setting the public agenda. All items were in play, courts were stacked and extremist's legislatures abdicated their law making ability to the courts. The executive branch simply turned a blind eye when radical lefties created a false impression that they were supporting the constitution when in fact they were and still are systematically undermining it. Left-Wing views that were on the fringe of the Democratic Party in the Sixties and Seventies are now center stage. These views, being forwarded by people like Reich, Dean, Kerry and Feingold, seem accepted as normal.   Left Wingers - control the media, academia, the sciences, think-tanks, and for most of the last century the executive, judicial and legislative branch. Republicans were demoralized, but the pendulum has finally begun to swing the other way. People are finally getting fed up with the extremist left who is arrogantly opposed to honest intellectual debate for they are fervently certain that they are correct in all matters. Their disdain for discourse and for anybody who challenges them is extant.  But the worst part is that radical lefties are uncivil to the extreme. They fill the public airwaves and bookstores with nastiness. Listen to Air America or watch a Michael Moore DVD. Read their editorials and you will find vicious vituperative attacks. Open a leftist political best-seller and you find more mean spirited screeds. Extremist lefties, RAD-COMS (Radical Communists) typically reduce political debate to nonsensical statements that seem to be making point but are nothing but vague and angry assertions, unsupported by facts.  But what we're now witnessing is something far more corrosive of civic life than normal political vitriol: It's viciousness directed toward anyone holding a view other than the prevailing elitist left-wing propaganda. Insults also calculated to belittle and ridicule entire groups or judged to be different are part of the divisive wedge that lefties like to play in hurting the cohesiveness of the nation.  The Conservative tradition values free speech and debate. No one should be deterred from speaking his or her mind for fear of offending some group. Lefties are opposed to this idea, the shouting down of Ann Coulter the attacks on Christians, etc, etc. Are all handiworks of the left. It is their mean-spirited trash talk that fills their protge's with this HATE and ANGER of anybody not like them.  I'm sorry Mr. Reich, I used to be one of these lefties, and I know the condescension with which I was taught to look at people on the right. The attacking of American Citizens rather than ideas, the smearing of whole segments of society for some perceived ills against our ideology. This is leftism at its base. Fear and Hate driven. No. Mr. Reich it will be a sad day when you and your type WIN America. People are waking up, they are realizing that the great Democratic Party of yesteryear has been hijacked by Radicals.   Your book speaks about morals but you never discuss where the morals come from. Conservative position comes from a bedrock of factual and historical facts. They are a clear-eyed view of where America is and where we need to go. Your left wing morals come from a modernist philosophy, blown by the wind and proven to be a disaster. You biggest moral imperative is to BLAME others but that is what happens when you are ideologically based rather than historically and fact based.  I could go on and on, but MR. Reich, I used to be on the left. But the divisiveness, hate, anger, name-calling, utter compliance with leadership, no dissention, no debate, and supreme arrogance drove me away. Once one is away and in the middle you look at the two competing political thoughts and it is scary, very scary to see what you once were.   Mr. Reich, I am not an automaton, and that is what you need to usher in your America. What the conservatives need, is open honest debate, free speech, and equal time. You have a fight on your hands, one that I am hoping for my children's sake that you lose. 
 I have read some bad books before, but never have had to talk myself into finishing one hoping it would get better.  It didn't. Don't waste your time or money 
 My first experience of William T.  I found the novel too reminiscent in technique of EL Doctorow's RAGTIME - the constant kaleidoscopic cutting between different sensibilities, interspersed with undisguised authorial commentary and narrative.  It works, but not as well - but then nor does Doctorow - as it did in their common parent, John Dos Passos.  Read his shorter (than his great trilogy, USA) novel, MANHATTAN TRANSFER to see the technique exploited to give a very real sense of an entire society at a moment in time.  The writing itself in EUROPE CENTRAL, dealing with a 'foreign' culture and age, is often too literal to really enthuse and affect and the background research seems 'dragged in', while the sense of the novel's overall design makes itself felt too evidently.  I will try more, but this is not the novel with which to begin the study of William T. Vollman 
 It's a cute premise but looks as though it were filmed by a group of kids for a school project.  The dance moves were briefly - too briefly - demonstrated.  Additionally, some of the "attitude" displayed was questionable for younger kids.  
 The first thing that you'll notice is that this is a skimpy, short book at 134 pages (160 if you include the appendices).  This would be ok if the content was substantial and useful.  Unfortunately, it provides a very introductory, shallow overview of the covered call writing strategy.  This too would be ok if this was a $15 quick read paperback, but it's an expensive hardcover (which is not worth the price).  I'd suggest the interested reader should check other books on the subject instead 
 Well, I read this "gem" because my 8th grader had to for class. Was the pig-rape scene or the graphic butchery of a beloved pet the most disgusting part?  I guess it's supposed to show  historical life in rural Vermont but I sure could have lived without it.  "Becoming a Man"?? There are far better books out there than this that can fit that bill. Long before my daughter remembers any "lessons" of this book, I'm sure the lingering descriptions of the rivers of blood and stench will stick with her. Plus, inbetween the great lessons we got about pig farming/butchery it's a pretty dull story. 
 The book is about a spoiled unsatisfiable teenage girl whom keeps marrying men and then running away from her problems because she doesn't like her situation. I was forced to reed this book in school and i had no sympathy for the main character Janie. She needs to realize that the world is not perfect. The only part of the book that i actually cared for was at the begining of the book when she is gossiped about upon walking back to town and she ignores the gossip and holds her head high 
 The author seems to be a pretty decent sculptor, but the book could definitely benefit from a spell-check!  The typos are innumerable, and the writing not especially coherent. There doesn't appear to be much that is new here, and it seems to me that a published demonstration of forensic sculpture should feature more than a budget plastic skull, which may or may not even be cast from an actual human specimen.  Stick with Karen Taylor or Caroline Wilkinson for very thorough descriptions of the American and Manchester methods of facial reconstruction (respectively) from renowned professionals.  You won't be disappointed 
 I really want to give this book at least 4 stars as I love the idea of encapsulating those great mathematical breakthroughs in one book and giving each a proper account instead of over simplistic summaries like many other math readings do.  HOWEVER, the errors contained in this book is intolerable. It doesn't make sense anymore to give those mathematical details as you can hardly follow them due to the errors.  For example, on page 5 it prints: If (2^n - 1) is a prime number then 2^(n-1)*(2^(n-1)-1) is a perfect number and that even perfect numbers must have this form.  it obveriously should be 2^(n-1)*(2^n - 1) instead of what has been printed. As other readers have suggested, you would expect more similar errors along the way.  Don't buy this book and wait for the 2nd edition if the publisher ever want to make an effort to make this book readable. I'm so very disappointed. 
 The Langoliers is my A #1 all-time favorite movie.  But I ordered the DVD from Amazon and it would not play in my DVD player.  I researched the internet and found it was in an old format that is now unreadable by newer DVD players (don't ask me, I am not terribly literate on DVD formats).  To watch the movie, I had to save it to my computer's hard disk in 5 gi-normous chunks (it would not save the whole thing to one file folder), then download freeware that I used to convert the format to something that Windows Media Player Classic (yes, folks, that's right - tho original WMP from the Windows 95 operating system - had to download that, too).  ONe chunk could not be read from the DVD because a sector was bad (?) so I am missing the whole first part of the movie.  I then converted each file folder using the freeware, and to watch the movie,  I have to sit at my computer and watch it on WMP Classic from 1995, and click on the next file folder as the previous one finishes.  Took me hours of research, but I love the movie so much, I had to get it to work.    [... 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 I'm a huge Black Sabbath fan.  I hear nothing in Black Mountain that even remotely resembles BS.  This CD really sucks if you are a hard rock fan.  It is soft, folksy, crap.  To me it sounds like the Mammas and the Pappas meet the Partidge Family 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 all this book is about is eating healthy and how you should not answer your door if someone knocks.  Its just not a way of life for me 
 "The Zahir" started out well, but about 100 pages into the book my interest level dropped.  It, in no way, mentally stimulated me.  I could not read one more page of the main character's self-indulgent and arrogant thoughts and actions.  I guess, if you are the type of person that needs to love the main character in order to read a novel, then this is not your book.  I couldn't stand him and I really hope that the main character isn't a reflection Paul Coelho.  I almost threw this book away, but I instead donated it.  I loved "The Alchemist." 
 All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place.  Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized.  Has the art of "posing" been lost by modern girls?  Maybe all the good directors have retired or died!  What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.   In spite of my being a certifiable "dirty old man". [:-)     
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 i cannot agree with any person who gives this over 1 star. The main problem I had with this product was that it was far too overpowering in the fragrance department. I swear, it was like bathing in GATORADE. And while I'm sure that AXE was going for that whole electrolyte thing in all its glory, but the smell is far too fragrant. And if you think that it has even the slightest bit of an invigorating quality, think again. I was a lot happier with Snake Peel 
 "Envy" is a hard book to pin down. In a nutshell, we have Will Moreland, a New York therapist who has elected to go to his college reunion. His wife Carole prefers to stay home since she does not know anyone and they are still feeling the emotional tug of the loss of their son, Luke. During the reunion, most people are more concerned with the whereabouts of his twin brother Mitch, a pretty famous long-distance swimmer, whom Will is estranged. After reading about some of his former collegiates, he comes across the bio of former flame Elizabeth and discovers that she has a daughter that could possibly be his. When he asks her, she justifiably balks at him.  He returns home, and seeks out a therapist of his own to discuss his intimacy issues with his wife, as well as his dark sexual fantasies, as they are starting to interfere with his effectiveness at his own practice. He is also having problems with the abandonment of his twin, who he has not seen since his wedding day. Mitch was born with birthmark that made him stand out to ridicule as a child. Will always felt guilt that his own face was not marred. Little does he know that the brother that he protected since childhood made a mockery of his devotion, as he slowly learns the truth behind Mitch's absence.  A new patient arrives in his office with her own intimacy issues. She is a student and seduces older men. When she relishes in telling him about her sex life in detail, it is evident that her next victim is going to be Will. After she makes an inappropriate move on him, he decides to terminate their relationship and refers her elsewhere. Soon, she is knocking down his door, insisting that he see her. When she disrobes, Will's own lack of willpower triggers a sexual escapade which he will forever wish did not happen, particularly when the patient reveals who she is.   Suddenly Will questions is own relationship with his wife, former lovers, his brother, and his parents. This really could have been a moving story, but I did not feel a connection in any way to the storyline - there was no real emotion, depth, or character development. The revelation of the student's identity is no surprise - anyone can se that coming. All told in a matter-of-fact manner, with little emotion, the story never has any clear resolution, nor any closure, making it a bit of a disappointment 
 I bought this book. I read this book. Then I put it back on the shelf where it has sat ever since.  I'm a more recent convert to Anne Rice's vampire books, having only read them since Pandora came out in '98 (By the way, thanks for that one Santa!)but I have since bought all the vampire and mayfair witches books. I enjoy the witches and the vampire books in two very different ways, and if I had not realised this before, it was made clear to me by this book. Unfortunately, even those parts I enjoyed were ruined by those I didn't. The introduction was both patronising insulting. Lestat's scene with the Pope, frankly silly, as has his very character become. I think the main problem I had with this book was the romance between my formerly favourite gorgeous fiend and Rowan, which seemed tacked on to the story as an after thought rather than a truely pivotal plot point. The series has been going for a while, and one can't blame the authoress for losing interest in the characters after so long, but one can't help but wish Lestat's final outing had been less... well, bland. I found the typographical errors frustrating, along with the plot holes and continuity errors (which others have gone into in great depth, so I won't bother with them). It's an okay resolution to the Witches series, but leaves the vampire series gasping and flipping around like a dying fish on the carpet. It's hard to say more without giving away the plot, so I wont, however, I will recommend other books by Anne Rice should this one not suit your taste.  DO read: Interview with the Vampire, Pandora, Vittorio the Vampire and Tale of the Body Snatcher.  Pandora, which I read first, remains my own personal favourite.     Now to address all the idiotic controversy:  1) Play the ball, not the man. When you write a review, keep your opinions of authors names to yourself. No-one cares. Nor do they care about your opinions of their private lives or habits.  2) Saying an author writes only for his or herself is not only a hideous cliche, but is undervaluing the work that goes into writing a successful book. If people are parting with their hard earned wodges of folding stuff  to purchase copies, and you are supplying copies, you are no longer writing only for yourself. If you are writing for yourself, it would be scribbled in private diaries.  3) On a public fourm, anyone can express their views, positive or negative. Variety of opinion is a sign of a healthy readership. Deal with it.  4) Don't feed the trolls.  When an author posts a rant, even if you feel it is justified, remember: Trolls who are posting merely for the attention take any response to them as a win and are thrilled. People giving honest reviews and critiques will find the vilification and insults defensive and immature. People who are devoted and loyal readers probably wont read any reviews. And those who make up the majority of the worlds readers, who have no particular affinity for any one author will take away a negative view of all those concerned. If you must reply to reviews (even the very off-topic ones) for goodness sake provide an calm and reasoned explanation do not denigrate, patronise or attack those with differing opinions.  This goes for reviewers as well 
 The book was great. The ending TERRIBLE. This is becoming a pattern with his books!!!! AVOI 
 Although an avid fantasy and science fiction fan, this is the first De Lint book I have read, and will probably be the last I will read.  The book takes place in the city of Newford, an imaginary city that is a frequent setting for De Lint stories, and draws on a pool of characters some of whom I understand to be recurring in other novels.  Drawing on folklore elements from different cultures, and switching frequently between primary characters, the book tells the story of a diverse group of young people caught up in a conflict between Gaelic spirits that seek to displace North American spirits.  The book had problems of every sort:  * Wooden dialogue, and just plain bad dialogue.  Apparently bilingual people think everything twice, once in one language and then again in the other language.  This gets very tired, very fast. Ce peut te faire fatigue, tres rapidement. * Cliches.  "And, Ellie? . . . Be careful." * Unconvincing characters.  This is essentially a plot driven book, so we don't look for great character depth, but even still . . .  * A profound lack of subtlety.  How many dozens of times must various characters remark upon "Aunt Nancy's" giant spider shadow?  Did the author think we didn't get it the first time?  Did the author think he was the only one who had ever read West African fables?  If he was the only one who had heard of Anansi, what is the point of having this exclaimed upon dozens of times?  What would it mean to us? * Great reliance on ad hockery and deus ex machina.  Given that this is a plot-driven book, the plot needs to be tight, engaging and convincing.  But the author violates one of the cardinal rules of fantasy writing, which is to set up a framework of operation for the story and then take it seriously and abide by it.  You can't have a story about wizards in which Superman suddenly appears.  Here, however, a new and important fact about the central conflict is invented every 30 seconds -- didn't I tell you that we could transform the monster by putting a mask on it?  Even the characters seem a little surprised and unable to explain the internal logic.  It reads as if it were a bed time story for a small child made up over the course of several months.  I understand De Lint has a large fan base.  I must believe he has written something better than this to deserve it.    
 I don't have anything personal against this book.I have dabbled in faux finishes and wanted more ideas on how to do different  techniques and this book was too  technical for me. It was more to do with making your own glazes and customizing your paints and info on the many utensils etc. I needed something more basic.I just want to be able to go to the store buy my own premade glaze and paint colors and then do a finish 
 There is a saying that Hawkins apparently has no knowledge of.     "If you wish to know where the sparrow flies... ask the sparrow."    Most of the mis-information in this book is the same old tired arguements against Wicca and Paganism that have been regurgitated for years by Christians. Most of Hawkin's arguements are meaningless to anyone who is not already a Christian. These arguements are presented as if the precepts of Christianity were proven "truth", and any other religious concepts are therefore false. What Hawkins fails to recognise is that the Christian precepts he uses are not proven, and indeed cannot be shown to be more valid that the religions he decrys, thus his arguements are flawed from the outset. Wiccans , and adherants of any other religion for that matter, can easily recognise this type of fallacy, and so anyone trying to use the "truth" of Christianity to disprove Wicca will be simply dismissed from the outset.    This book is simply a tool to make Christians feel better about themselves, while demonising another religion. If you think you can use this book to "save" your children or friend from Wicca... then you are probably the reason they rejected Christianity in the first place 
 I have not had a good pillow in a long time.  I wouldn't pay upwards of fifty dollars for a pillow.  But I gave in after reading the reviews and got this one.  It's way overpriced in my opinion but they are onto a very good idea.  First, I have had it for a couple of weeks and it's pretty flat now.  The coils are only in the very center of the pillow, and at times you do notice them there, but not in a bad way, just noticable.  The problem is the fluff they add to the pillow must be the cheapest possible nothing.  I imagine I will have a really strange looking square blob surrounded by a moat of flat fabric pretty soon.  At first, it was really comfy. I think that if they either put high quality fluff around it, or better yet put coils through the entire thing, with higher ones in the center, this would be outstanding, beyond all other pillows!  But as it is, it's not worth the price yet.  If you have tons of money to burn, go ahead and try it.  I wouldn't recommend anyone get two to sleep on at once, they would be awkward and they would be falling off the sides of eachother.  You could use a regular pillow below this one, but then you are back into the same pillow finding - switching game we all want to avoid.  I would have given three stars if it were a lot cheaper, but after going flat after only a few weeks, and the price, I had to give it two 
 I don't think this book is that good, for it's written in such a style that I find it difficult to read. The author should have at his service a better editor, which might have helped his to re-arrangement certain parts of the book in a more logical way 
 Does not compare with Motorola.  The range was poor.  Interestingly, when I pressed the call button, that was transmitted but the recipient couldn't pick up my voice and vice versa.  If they work for you, then you have a good deal.  But not for me.  
 This is a formulaic love story set in what is supposed to be a research institution. The author has clearly done a lot of reading and found a lot of trivia about fads, and drops short infobites about fads in history into the text throughout. Unfortunately the plot moves slowly, the writing is competant in a breezey way and the researchers don't appear to do any real research. As a researcher myself I was disappointed in the shallow portrayal of science. Apart from the rather unlikely ways in which the main characters conduct their research (going to the public library to find general books on sheep? Sorting newspaper clippings but never having any idea of a theoretical approach?) there are just silly factual mistakes, like when the protagonist is said to have a double major in her PhD.   William Gibson's Pattern Recognition is about the same general ideas but is much better written with a more engaging and less clichéed plot 
 DBF was trying something different with this book- and I appreciate that- but the effort just didn't gel.  Grace, a worldly travel agent, lets her overbearing extended family bully her emotionally.  This organized and ballesie travel agent, whose boyfriend does stem cell research, caves into that?  That premise didn't wash and Grace's extended and detailed faith crisis really wore me down.    DBF's humor was still there, but I disliked Grace's family so much, and tired of the overly described faith crisis, that I just became irritated and started skimming and flipping pages to get finished (I've never had to do that with a DBF book before).   The travel agent slant allowed DBF to describe other locales, but, DBF, please return to writing about the sea water and marsh of the Low Country.  That's what hooked us! 
 The story was the most silly and childish book that I ever read from this writer. Most dissapointed for a Danielle Steel novel. I had never had a book from Danielle Steel that I did not love but this one I don't know what else to say, bad, bad, bad 
 This is Nick Cave treading water. Yes, there are some beautiful ballads and a few rocking numbers, but there's nothing here he hasn't done better before. "Babe I'm on Fire" is a blast, but other than that there isn't anything on this album that stays with me. This one is for obsessives only, everyone else is better off with "Henry's Dream", "Let Love In", or "Your Funeral My Trial". 
 Europe is bad, America is good, Number One , best of the world, uniquely great...Well, that is all there is to it here. This book is a constant insult to the intelligence of the reader, whether he be conservative or liberal, given the absurd violence and anger of the tone. Interestingly enough however, as others have pointed out, Rabkin's true haunting fear is not about the European Union, but rather American progressives willing to claim American ideals for the cause of peace and justice 
 Utterly bleeping pointless. This stuff is so pointless to watch, you shouldn't accept a copy even if someone tries to give it to you, because it would just cause you to waste the time it takes to watch it.   And do not be deceived by the title. There's very, very little baseball on here. The one segment devoted to just baseball is not bloopers - it's pranks. And not a single one of them were funny. Putting a snake in a bread basket? It's not funny, and it has nothing to do with baseball.  [... 
 If you like the styling -- buy it!  hey, it comes in COLORS!  But, if you want performance and reliability  - AVOID any Francis unit.  They are made poorly, and of light materials.  Dave -- professional espresso repairman 
 When Dickens was good, he was very very good.  When he was bad, he was wordy and sappy and boring.  Did you ever wonder why you never heard of the three stories in this book?  Because they're so unremarkable!  The title story is the best; i.e. it's the only one that's even readable.  Do yourself a favor, don't read this boo 
 I was hoping for a book that would help me put together menus with the best nutrition information.  this one just didn't do that for me.  instead it had the same old tired and conflicting information as the other books or magazines.  plus, this one spent way too much time on the digestive process.  most of us already know that or just don't care 
 "What's Up", the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune (which, I always thought, would have been the perfect song  for Heart), is the only thing good here.  The rest of this album is a mess.  Linda Perry has, of course, gone on to better things 
 The problem with Alexandra's books is that once you've read one, you've  read them all. I purchased Living a Beautiful Life and it has the same  Grace Notes inside that others reference in her other books, like...Decant  your mouthwash, Splurge on Flowers, etc. Did she actually forget she  already gave us those hints years ago or what 
 I was really hoping that SMART MOUTH would be better than MOUTH TO MOUTH (my first Erin McCarthy novel). Surprise, surprise...it didn't take me long to see that I would be disappointed--AGAIN! I didn't even get pass Chapter 2 without rolling my eyes at the heroine's silly antics. I found Reese even more obnoxious than Laurel (the female protagonist of MOUTH TO MOUTH). She's a snotty character: selfish, arrogant, annoying, and yes...bitchy. I wouldn't have had the patience that Derek (our hero) so amazingly bestowed upon her. Thus said, this is definitely going to be my last Erin McCarthy read.  
 While I didn't partiularly care for this book, I can see how others might like it.  I'm not a big fan of fake meat products, and this book has an over abundance of recipies featuring processed "meat" analogs.  I very rarely use this book for this reason.  That being said, I do enjoy her baked goods section.  So, if you don't mind the vegetarian "meat," you may like this book, but if you don't like it either, then you may want to go with her other cookbook, "the Soy of Cooking," which tends to use more vegetables, temph and tofu rather than "meat. 
 So, a bunch of mafia gangsters come over and shoot each other up, then they go out west and shoot each other up there, including one particular scene in which a bunch of people all get shot up together as part of a sort of montage. Woo hoo. How brilliant. I'll never forget this movie. NOT. 
 I didn't care for this book at all.  We have purchased several children's adoption books including Jamie Lee Curtis's book and "Why was I adopted" and were very pleased. But this one I was just not comfortable with.  Can't really put my finger on the exact reason, but we returned it immediately 
 What if I had made a horror movie in high school? It would have gone something like this..  My best friend Tara, an aspiring thespian who can fake cry really well, would be my star.  Before filming, we'd make sure to touch up Tara's delicious golden locks.  Oooops, A little bit too much bleach!   My story would revolve around a group of teenagers trapped in a strange house where they'd stumble upon an eerie, comatatose man wearing a bathing suit (Tom from the swim team would be a perfect fit...of course we'd have to shave his head...I wonder if he'd be willing?). The strange house will be dark and water will be dripping from everywhere, maybe in slow motion.  Tara and my other friends/actors will be extremely dim witted, and mostly deaf so that they can't hear each other very well.  My characters will then die one by one in entirely standard an unoriginal death sequences.  I'll think of some totally absurd story to tie everything together later, but it is sure to be absolutely terrifying. I'll save money by using a lot of stock footage, staging the car accident just "after" the accident occurs, and  scoring the music myself on my Casio at home.   Genius.  I'm going to be the most popular guy in school 
 For the last time, America was not founded as a christian nation, the Founders were uniformly hostile either to the christian religion or to the traditional "Trinitarian" churches.  America's secular destiny was and continues to be hijacked by zealots as (or more) dangerous as the religiously motivated terrorists they so often decry.  This book is their rallying ground and their manifesto.  I advise every true patriot to go out and buy as many copies as you can reasonably afford.  Then burn them 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 While this book does present useful topics that are particularly relevant to AJAX applications, my main problem with it is the poorly edited and structured way it is written.   The book is full of paragraphs like this one (found at the very beginning of the "Applicability section" of the "Decoupled Navigation Pattern"):  "The Decoupled Navigation pattern is used when content is navigated. The statement is obtuse and does not really say anything because HTML content is always navigated. However, because of the way Dynamic HTML is used, content navigation is sometimes used to generate an effect. When links are used to generate effects, the Decoupled Navigation pattern does not apply."  That's the whole paragraph beginning to end -- what the heck is this trying to say? Apparently aware of how non-sensical this is, the author starts the next paragraph with "To clarify this explanation..." and then goes on to present an example of a website in Swiss German (I think), with no translation given. Two pages of more examples and a summary rules-of-thumb later, and the only implied take-away is that the Pattern applies when decision-making and data processing are required, and the contents of the page change but not completely.  A few sections like this could be forgiven (and you could quibble as to why he had to write this example this way), but stuff like this prevails throughout every chapter. More often than not, ideas which with some thought could have been condensed into a few sentences, result in half a page of digressions and logical dead-ends.  Here's another one:  "The need to separate the resource from the representation has not been adequately explained, and some developers may wonder why it is necessary at all. After all, may websites work well and nobody has complained too loudly. The reason why many websites work well is because they have probably implemented the separation of resource from representation. And those that have not done so have received complaints."  Upon reading this, I feel some irreplaceable portion of my lifespan has just been wasted.  At least one good thing this book does is that it only focuses on Patterns that are particular to an AJAX environment (e.g. Persistent Communications, Decouple Navigation, etc.), without wasting time on stuff that is applicable to other more general software design settings (which plenty of other books already cover of course).   While the ideas in this book are interesting and potentially useful to somebody beginning to design an AJAX application, the writing style makes reading it a true chore. Surely there is better written stuff out there on AJAX software design 
 This book is not a DM's book. With the exception of a few tatical feats, and some new weapons, this book, with the majority of its pages detailing new prestige classes, is not a book that was meant to ever enter the hands of a DM. I saw one feat in here I liked, and I payed 25 dollars for the privlige to look at it. In short, if your a DM, dont buy the book, if your a character who is big on fighters, go ahead. But be warned, some of the prestige classes are hopelessly stupid. The Eye of Gruumsh is the prime example, its abilities are just wierd, not to mention bad, and although I rarely judge a class by its portrait, I must say that is without question, the ugliest D and D picture I have ever seen. The new base classes are kind of repetitive, like a pretty lame remake of the Samurai. A hint;if your buying the book so you can use that class, don't, buy Oriental Adventures, save money, and end up with a better class. Some things appeal to my PC side though, like the Spellsword, which offers the best spellcaster/fighter mix I've seen in a long time. And then there's the Hulking Hurler, the most uber chea class I have EVER seen. If my PCs ever even try to get me to let them use this class I swear I will write an angry letter to Wizards of the Coast, telling them to stop making classes that can be used to defeat the purpose of arena deuling of even normal D+D. Still the book fails to really deliver anything important, not overly recomended 
 Very much a disappointment! Especially for those of you who were deticated fans to the Talking Heads throughout the late 70's and 80's. The first three tracks were okay, I guess or better yey I should say TOLERABLE. Tracks 4 through 10 on the other hand ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Like fingernails on a black board and it's sad because those of you who could dance to classic hits such as "burning down the house" that listened to this album know there's nothing you can dance to, or really even upbeat for that matter. It was an unfortunately exhausted effort by who even by 1988 was a worn out band. Why do you think later by the following year maybe 1990 they broke up 
 With each passing book, the story lines seem to get thinner and thinner, which is why, I suppose, Karon decided to uproot the preacher and his wife and move them to an island 600 miles away from Mitford. A change of scenery to introduce some new people and stories. Still, it seems the main character spends most of his time either praying or saying "consider it done." The characters seem to lack depth and almost everyone is perfect. And the people who aren't perfect still get to have happy endings. The things that make for a good story - a character who wants something and is trying to get it against all odds, a plot that has a climax, a believable antagonist and protagonist, etc. - are lacking in this book 
  I have used one crock pot or another for many years. I bought this one because I was delighted with the sturdy removable stoneware bowl; I really like this feature. Clean-up is easy. I use this crock pot for soups and beans because it cooks way too hot for anything else. Even so, I need to stir from time to time. Apparently, excessive temperature is the problem most people are having with this pot. This might be a safety issue; I would not keep this pot on and leave the house. I am disappointed that the handle has broken off of the lid, which really should not happen with normal use. I lifted the lid, to stir of course, and off came the handle! Lifting the lid is definately normal use!   
 It's great to see the author writing customer reviews of their own book?  Turned me off from buying the book.  How stupid does she think people are 
 I am shocked to read the reviews on this cookbook.  It's terrible. The pictures are beautiful, and the food looks wonderful, but the cookbook doesn't hold up.  The recipes will call for ingredients that are not in the ingredient lists, and you have to know how to cook to use it...for instance, it will tell you to use 3 slices of ginger, but won't tell you to peel the ginger first.  Elsewhere, it says to "bring to a simmer and simmer" when it means bring to a boil and simmer.  We tried 3 recipes, all of which bombed--2 of them were too spicy to eat, and I love spicy food.  This is a horrible cookbook.  I can't figure out why Donna Hay is such a popular cookbook author.  The only cookbook I ever threw away was her Fast Food cookbook for similar reasons, and this one is just as bad, although I did hear the Sticky Chicken and Parmesan Chicken recipes were good.  Try them first 
 If this is what manhood is all about, I think it's time to rethink our existance on this planet.  Bad script and mediocre acting.  Character stories were told incompletely so half the time you are trying to figure out what is going on 
 Awful...Truly awful.  Joanne Sellar and Daniel Lupi (producers of Boogie Nights and Hard Eight) should be ashamed of themselves and so should the Weinsteins for producing this piece of crap 
 Not very well written. Its is simplistic & somewhat condescending. Later chapters tend to repeat basic concepts covered earlier without expanding upon the issues. There are more knowlegable authors out there that are refreshing and can effectively advance the your knowledge 
 In Amazon's ultimate wisdom they will NOT return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in Beta status.  I ordered these in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain Splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone.  I'd avoid the Amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards 
 Herbert Norris' based his books off of the Victorian views of the middle ages and renaissance... not the time periods themselves. What he could not derive from the Victorians, he just made up. In addition, his redrawings are much changed from the originals. If you want to make a halloween costume that has a medieval or renaissance "feel" to it, go ahead and purchase this book. However, if you are a historical costumer or are interested in accuracy at all, buy this book only if you want a paperweight 
 From the book: "Managers know that software development follows Parkinson's Law: Work will expand to fill the time alloted to it." This is such an outdated idea and method for managers to deal with software engineers the rest of the book was tainted for me by his obvious distain for software engineers. Only the worst kind of un-trusting manager would assume that his engineers will naturally drag their feet if the schedule allows it.  Another example of his contempt for programmers: "All of the analysis and careful thinking done by high-powered and high-priced executives is made moot by the unilateral cherry picking of a programmer following his own muse or defending his turf."  Sorry but the white button down shirt wearing, schedule dictating, programmer dis-trusting manager has no place in software development nor writing books telling me how to manage my software engineers 
 This book is written by an annoying, weak man.  The formal innovations are vaguley interesting, but in any case do not rescue the work from its primary deficit: you must sit there for several hours with the voice of a neurotic chatty little wimp who reminds one of a certain kind of homosexual man streaming through your mind, mostly in the form of digressions and non-sequitors.  This is neither entertaining nor enlightening, and since it's the product of design it is actually a little infuriating.  I too listen with good faith to the academic hierarchy present and past for recommendations, and I had in my version the hitherto utterly reliable Frank Kermode as Introducer; but damn, this book - its characters, its plots, its language, its taxing convolusions - is just annoying.  Its only virtue is that reading it might raise awareness that vaguely condescending moralistic little works like this about unheroic, petty, neurotic, sordid, idle, superficially cosmopolitan people are a mistake to begin with, and - since we all have only 70 or 80 years on earth and aren't all compulsive aesthetes - time would be better spent elsewhere.  There is nothing of the hard Sophoclean light here 
 Jesus Christ is Yahweh.  Yancey doesn't understand that.  God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  God NEVER changes.  God is Holy Trinity.  God in the Old Testament is Holy Trinity.  God in the New Testament is Holy Trinity.  God now is Holy Trinity.  When Jesus Christ comes back, God will be Holy Trinity.  God will be Holy Trinity forever as He was before the Creation of the World.  Thus, Jesus Christ who is God the Son is Yahweh of the Old Testament.  Anyone who teaches otherwise is going to HELL because he doesn't know Christ personally 
 I found this book to be annoyingly simplistic.  The illustrations - full color photographs - are nice enough but the text leaves a lot to be desired.    For example, the book gives three steps for sewing in a zipper, which might be enough if they told you whether to use thread or yarn for the backstitching into place (the picture seems to show them using yarn but it's not really clear), whether or not to remove the backstitching (the picture of the finished garment appears to show the (rather sloppy)backstitching still in place.  The third step is to slip stitch the edge of the zipper into place...again, no mention of whether to use the yarn or matching thread, though it would appear to be embroidery floss.  Kitchenering is shown briefly (and not explained very well) but is called "Grafting by Sewing," so a newcomer to knitting wouldn't know what to look for in this book when confronted with the term "Kitchener" in a pattern and, alternatively, when faced with the term "Kitchener" in a pattern wouldn't know that this was the method they might have seen in this book called "Grafting by Sewing."  I'm sure there are better books on finishing techniques than this one 
 I guess this author doesn't bother to check his "facts". Too much work perhaps. Many, many errors. Clearly, he didn't even bother to read Asimov's autobiography completely. One of many errors: He thinks Marty Greenberg and Martin H. Greenberg are the same person. In Asimov's autobiography, he says in several places they are 2 different people. Asimov goes to great lengths in his autobiography to stress they are 2 different people. So much so, that he he refers to MHG as 'Marty the Other' in several places. This is just one of several errors. When someone makes as many errors as White does, how can you trust anything he says? Although Asimov wrote fiction and non-fiction, White seems to have blended the 2 in one book. However, how can you tell which part is fiction and which part is non-fiction? 
 I did not find this book helpful for someone who has been medically diagnosed as having true thyroid disease. It is old news.  Perhaps can be helpful to someone who suspects they my have a thyroid condition who is just beginning the journey into thyroid disease 
 I decided to rent this movie after having seen Farenheit 9-11 and compare the two. Comparing it to Farenheit 9-11 this movie is amazingly bad. Farenheit brought out things that were done by Congress that this movie just glossed over. Farenheit actually interviewed congress members who admitted that they had not read the act before voting on it. This filn stated that they had all carefully read it in a very quickly glossed over statement. They did not address the Bush-Bin Laden connection or the fact that the Bush administration very quickly got the Bin Laden family out of the country after 9-11.  This movie is just a rehash of the Bush campaign's attack on John Kerry and really not worth the time it takes to watch it. And it's only a little bit over an hour long!!! Doesn't present any documentation of the "facts" that it proposes. At least Michael Moore backs up his charges with either documentation or direct interviews with the subjects. Also, much of what is proposed in this film has now been proven false.  Don't waste your money or time with this film 
 Having used the third edition on many an occasion, i was dismayed to find the 5th edition so inferior---no nutritional assessment tools are included at all, and of course then, no discussion  whatever of the validity and reliability of various screening methods.  No discussion of HOW to do a proper 24 hour diet recall, just the listing of it in the assessment process.  i was further disappointed to read the statement that babies should be breastfed until the age of one year: the AAP recommendation reads "for AT LEAST one year."  
 This book did not offer nearly enough real-life examples for thank you letters. Do not waste your money.  
 I have been a long time reader of self improvement books, as well as many finance books.  So, I was very interested in reading a book that would seem to have them both in one read.    I was very disapointed, although some research may have gone into where the author actually figured out the "21 Secrets", it seems to me like he went to the self help section and pulled 21 phrases out of the air and wrote short essays on them.  I don't need a cross-referenced table and 30 page bibliography, but this seems a little fishy.    For those that are looking for insight into what it really makes a millionare and how to get there, I would recommend reading the "Millionare Next Door".  For those that are looking for other information on self improvement anything by Anthony Robbins, the "7 habits..." by Steven Covey, or Napolean Hill's "How to Make Friends and Influence People" are great reads.  Overall, it seems like this is the Cliff Notes version of all the other books.  Which is great if all you need are motivational phrases to get you to the top, but if you really want to learn and hold on to something you should look elsewhere 
 This shall be an interesting short article not a book. Too much padding. Any high school grad can easily summarize it in a one single A4 page. Disappointing since written by serious people. Managing Your Customers as Investments, an Amazon book by GUPTA and LEHMAN is uncomparably better 
 Whoever wrote this book, the group that did, should be made to do it over again!  I'm not kidding, it is this horrible.  I've been a gamer, for a very long time and know what I'm doing; not saying I'm the best or anything like that, but I know when I see a crap strategy guide.  This guide is only a guide pertinent towards real life racing and not the game, as it speaks volumes on real technique and real cars, while neglecting the fact that we aren't driving real cars (while close), but a driving simulator game!  I want to know (see), like the previous guides each and every task and how to beat them; for instance, there is not one good piece of info on the driving missions, nor for any of the races.  The license section, on how to aquire them is great, but still lacking.  Check out the old Verus game guides, they did the last Gran Turismo guide, and you won't find nearly any complaints towards it...  Geezz, if we wanted a thick collectible Gran Turismo book we could have waited and gone to Ebay and gotten it cheaper.  This book is a ripp off for what you get, do not buy it, if you do you'll know why I said don't.  Make your own strategy or look one up online, their are plenty of legitimate online strategies, so dig in.  Take care and all the best to you.. 
 I was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing (in an "advice o'the day" format) of tidbits of wisdom. The wisdom offered is good, mind you, but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you (eg on a long car ride) you will likely be disappointed. I can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before I lose interest 
 After reading the 1st book in the series and knowing "whodunit" throughout most of the book, I thought I would give this series another shot.  About 50 pages into the book I knew who the criminal was.  I never finished this series.  However, I have enjoyed other books by Terri Blackstock 
 This book may be helpful to some, not me. It all seemed to be to heady, if that is a word, and I didn't feel the urge to go past the first page. As I said maybe for some, not for me 
 I found that this book got too bogged down in details that were not necessary to the story, especially what people should and shouldn't wear for foxhunting and the breeding of hunting dogs.  I usually love the Sneaky Pie series, and thought I would try another by her. I was very disappointed. The characters were very likeable, especially Sister and Shaker.  The mystery itself was developed as an "oh, by the way" during her account of the Wide World of Foxhunting.  I also thought that if she was going to have dialogue from the animals, they should have at least played a part in solving the mystery 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 I read this book for a political science course as a required reading. All students, with a few exceptions, found this book boring. It is difficult, perhaps Hirschman wanted it this way, to follow his choice of words, examples,and processes. It was originally published in 1970, how some can make this material relevant or useful in today's economic and political world, is difficult to process. A better, more understood, book should be out in circulation. This book, I will only say, is not part of my library 
 I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.  Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?  The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend 
 This was some of the most self-serving, melodramtic drivel I've read, well, ever.  I usually put garbage like this aside, but I'd just been to Belize and promised a friend I'd read it.  
 I admire Ishiguro for writing a risk-taking book, most unlike any I have read befire.  Unfortunately, this novel fails in its objectives, except for itself being a unique piece of fiction.  The protagonist is an english detective, who appears to be completely delusional about his current circumstances, and who is willing to take these delusions to great lengths.  Because of this, the plot eventually becomes irrelevant to reality.  This is when the book shows its signs of brilliance, when the plot is recognized as meaningless and the major themes take over in a Chinese battle.    Unfortunately this brilliant culmination hardly makes up for the rest of the novel.  Besides the poor/meaningless plot, the novel does not have a single character the reader cares about.  The thematic sequence, during which the book finally seems to be about something, is all too fleeting.  Soon after the plot returns even more absurd than before.  It's a truly frustrating experience 
 This is a picture book biography of Dizzy Gillespie. We learn that he is beaten by his father while growing up.  At school he takes an interest in music and let's his anger flow through the trumpet he is learning to play.  He goes on to make a name for him self.  He makes his own style of music  and the people love it!    At one point in the text a bunch of symbols were written and it looked like the author was wanting to write a curse word in the book but used the symbols as well.  I really didn't like that at all in a picture book for young readers.  I really would look else where for a good bio on Dizzy. 
 I'm not feeling this soundtrack. It's everything that I hate about modern music: all style and no substance, too many heavy beats and not enough melody, too much pop and not enough genuine soul. I could go on and on. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Nothing memorable here 
 While much of the material discussed in "A Great Wall: Six Presidents and China" is questionable in nature, one comment from the book's jacket lining puts everything into focus: "A Great Wall is an epic that reads more like a novel than an investigative history."  And this is precisely the main structural defect that causes "A Great Wall" to crumble under its own weight. 	"A Great Wall" is the kind of instant journalism that inside-the-beltway types love, reveling in extended descriptions of questionable motives, personality clashes, bureaucratic warfare, and Washington-specific gossip and name-dropping.  Instead of digging deep into the history of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China, Patrick Tyler opted for ad nauseam descriptions of Henry Kissinger's megalomania, paranoia, and penchant for excessive secrecy. Tyler also finds it efficacious to extrapolate on Zbigniew Brzezinski's attempts to direct U.S.-China policy by himself, embarrass Cyrus Vance and Richard Holbrooke, hoodwink President Carter, and desire to elevate his public persona on par with Henry Kissinger's.  Tyler's choice in emphasizing personalities as the chief determinant of U.S. policy toward China, relayed to the reader in a "fly on the wall" manner, seriously detracts from Tyler's overall scholarship and ability to tell an informative and convincing story. 	Tyler's "A Great Wall" has also faced the embarrassment of being publically denounced by President Carter as "grossly biased" and by Dr. Brzezinski as a "complete fabrication."  This reader expected a better effort from someone who should have a firmer grip of the subject matter, having served Beijing Bureau Chief for The New York Times. A reader looking for an informative overview of the normalization of U.S.-China relations is better off with James Mann's "About Face."  "A Great Wall: Six Presidents and China" is a big disappointment 
 Despite what others would have me believe, I do not remember chuckling, much less laughing, at any moment while reading this book.  I just kept patiently waiting for a story, or even a point, to surface, but after finishing the Epilogue I didn't find either 
 This book covers ALL cats in general, it's not specific enough for Persians. Dissappointing 
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 Get "Universe by Design" by Danny Faulkner or "Starlight and Time" by Russell Humphreys 
 I am a Jersey Girl, about Bruce's age and a big Bruce fan, but this book was a total disappointment.  The pictures seem to be  all from one roll of film taken on the same day.  One poster would cover the whole book for a whole lot less money 
 sorry to say that i'm very dissapointed to own this book. For those who are new to VBA, it is not a good start from here. I also find that the example and the function covered is not practical enough to use to develop your own program. I would recomend a book written by John Walkenbach which the examples and function cover more practical 
 This book is for anything but the classroom. The material is too complex for new students. I used it in three sessions. I  could not get over the stress of teaching it. My students found that AE is too hard. It seems that the writers ignored that people have short memories. They expected the readers to keep up with a long project, the subject of the book. I found that the Meyer books had a better approach.  
 You bet he does! If you want to read a book by a notorious homophobic, right wing, friend of Dr. Laura then go right ahead. Know your authors!!! If I could, I'd have given him zero stars. Blah 
 Very bizzare movie! Not for kids or anyone who is prudish! Can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it 
      I put this mount on my M-44 today, and I am not impressed.  There is side to side play due to the 1/32 or so gap between the side of the scope mount, and where the original sight seats.  Not a whole lot, but you don't need much play to have your zero [...] out after a couple of rounds.       All of the set screws are loose in their respective threaded holes.  One of the set screws stripped the scope mount threads before any tension could be placed on it.  The screw that passes through the sight ears was to short to thread the included nut on, so I mounted it with the original set pin for the rear sight.  The mount did not line up with the barrel when mounted, and this was obvious to the unaided eye - the mount was pointing left of true, and I don't know if the scope would be able to compensate!  I don't think Loctite will be able to hold the set screws in place, once a few rounds have gone down range.  Some of the supplied allen wrenches didn't even fit the set screws!       I have not fired the weapon with this thing mounted, and I am tempted to just toss it and chalk it up as a loss.  The design could work, if a little more attention was placed on the manufacturing process.       On the plus side, it was cheap, and the shipping was quick.  
 It's really amazing.  Ah, not the score itself, no, what I mean is: this score is now 6 years old, and it sounds like Hans Zimmer recorded it yesterday. And in case you don't notice, this is not a compliment. I listen to "Am I Not Merciful", and I hear Da Vinci Code and Batman Begins. I listen to "Barbarian Horde", and all I can think of is Pirates Of The Caribbean. Alright, this is not really a point against this soundtrack, since the scores mentioned above came after Gladiator, but an inevitable fact remains - Zimmer obviously isn't able to create an original score even if his life depended on it. His music for ancient Rome sounds just like his music for a superhero, a mystery thriller or pirates. And here's another fact: this score doesn't fit the picture. Yes, the structure of Roman music is unknown, but I doubt that it consisted of synth bass, synth horns and synth orchestral crashes. Yes, Hans, we know you don't care about the individual atmospheres of the films you score, but do you have to make it that obvious? And Zimmer's original material for Gladiator isn't even his own. Other composers also take bits and pieces from classical masters, but Zimmer's use is so blatant that he got himself a lawsuit from the Gustav Holst foundation.  Then let's talk about the orchestration. Frankly, I'm tired of bringing this up in every Zimmer review, but he forces me. I will tell you what I think: Hans Zimmer has no clue about how to use the orchestra, much less how to properly combine it with synths. That's why every score of his makes a 100 piece orchestra sound like a 9 piece school band. He figured out the basics of how the string sections can be combined, and now he slaps it onto every score he does. Everyone who had basic musical education in school and does some research in the web can write like this. I must know because I do. And I had no formal musical training whatsoever. No wonder Zimmer's music sounds so monotone when he doesn't take advantage of the woodwind sections at all, which further proofs my point about Zimmer not understanding the orchestral apparatus at all. He rarely lets different sections interact, but this is what can make music sound diverse. His music here isn't diverse, it's pale and faceless. The wailing female voice by Lisa Gerrard is indeed the only thing that evokes a wee bit of atmosphere, although her lines seem barely written at all.  I'm not saying Ben- Hur or Spartacus or King Of Kings or El Cid hit the right tone for ancient Rome, but at least these were done by skillful musicians who could write, expand and orchestrate an original tune. I've heard numerous times that Hans Zimmer is an experimental composer; this is the most ridiculous joke I've ever heard about the film scoring industry. There's nothing experimental about his music, Gladiator or any other score, it's just the same thing in a new package. His former ghostwriters, who were able to detach themselves from Zimmer, like Harry- Gregson Williams or John Powell, have become far more creative than Zimmer has ever been. All Zimmer did was make synthesized music that could be produced without any originality within two weeks the idustry's standard. And that harmed the fine art film scoring used to be more than anything that ever happened within the past 50 years. And Gladiator was a huge part of that because it elevated Zimmer to the level of popularity he is on right now.  And Gladiator seems to be the score that Zimmer constantly revisits to take bits and pieces from, just to flesh them out and sell them as scores for other films. Gladiator combines all Zimmer scores that followed it, and aren't all Zimmer scores of the past 6 years combined worth 2 stars?  But who knows how many composers really worked on Gladiator. 
 The story of these two characters reminds me of two worms vainly swimming against the current of a flushed toilet. If a film presents a story with no redeeming qualities is that film worth watching? I think not. Fine cinematography in the Texas opening scene and the classic Nilsson performance of Everybodys Talking cannot salvage a film that is nothing more than an early appearance of big budget decadence. Skip the film and go sit in a gutter for ten minutes. Same effect 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries.  It frequently appears as though the brief, daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added.  It does provide an extensive recap of President Clinton's life events, so if that's of interest you may want to check it out 
 i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout, i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it. it go's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it, but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right. there are better ones out there than this, but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it 
 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 I found a few of his ideas to be interesting - but it was mostly a rehash of already printed ideas....and some ideas were outlandis 
 This book began to contradict on matter of King of kings Ismail. In one Chapter author wrote that King Ismail was a great King and was the best thing happened to Iran, the following chapter the author illustarted King Ismail as a burtail King of Iran 
 Like every other diet book out there: her argument boils down to:  Eat right Exercise  She's a hypocrite. She goes on and on about how evil the diet industry is and how she's one of us because she was once fat. Fine: great. But half her arguements I'm not buying: No one fact checks books anymore.  Also, the book is still fixated on fat. Recently, we learned that it isn't just fat that makes us fat. Look at a bag of sugar: if I eat that, will I not gain a pound? It's fat free...  Great Susan: how do we stop the insanity? First: EAT WHATEVER YOU WANT (as long as it's health food) Second: EXERCISE Third: BREATHE (I think this is just filler cuz she didn't have anything else to offer).  Instead of starving ourselves, we're to go to a chart of how many calories we're to expend a day. That's still cutting calories.   Also, lumping OA into the diet industry is wrong: it's not for profit. Taking people out for a walk instead of going to an OA meeting is like taking raging alcoholics out for coffee instead of attending an AA meeting. A temporary solution to an underlying problem. Didn't susan later have some sort of substance abuse problem too? Methinks the lady doth protest too much...  She's gotten all her little droogs to write raving comentaries on her book: but who the hell has heard of Susan Powter in the last 10 years. NO ONE!! SA's a flash in the pan.   Here's the scoop: eat right and exercise. Now pay me a billion dollars cuz I'm telling you "the truth. 
 I'm giving up on this book.  It reads like a first draft.  Sentences like the following on page 71 abound: "When you hear not so often as you wish, remember, our silence means our safety," the Committee of Secret Correspondence  - now doing business as the Committee for Foreign Affairs, although Franklin, who had never mastered the original name, was not to know for months - soothed the envoys, whom they understood to be starved for news.      Schiff needed a good editor but didn't get one.  This certainly isn't Pulitzer grade material.  I wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth.      Van Doren in his biography gives a better account of Franklin's years in Paris. 
 Look if you want a book to kind a good charicter who is serious this is not the book. But if you are looking for a comedic monologue this is your book 
 Busy with a project of my own (Author of "Warrior of the Three Moons") I have finally found time to catch up on both the SoT and the WOT series. Now having worked my way through Book 8 of SoT and Book 9 of WoT, I am determined to end my own series in 5, possibly 6, books.   Ok about "Naked Empire." I enjoyed the parts with Zedd and Nathan and Chase. And it was good that Adie was back in the story. Those vibrant charaters basically saved the book. Having said that, the book could have easily been reduced by 200 - 250 pages. All authors, myself included, tend to inject our life phlosophies into our stories. Unfortunately, TG went overboard in Naked Empire. I found myself skipping over Richard's pedantic preaching. Hopefully TG will rediscover his story-telling abilities in Book 9.  
 The book is TEDIOUS. A few mediocre yarns and lots of detail about Irish horseracing last year and before. Lots of old, once-charming Irish cliches repeated and repeated. Too many names, too much trivial detail about weather, horses and people you don't need to know. I'm a horse owner and interested in racing. I was bored after 50 pages, but battled on for awhile. Maybe the ending is a corker, but I doubt it. Never got that far.  This would make a good 1,500-word magazine piece. Barich is a good writer, but this book is destined for the remainder table - and soon. It is a chore to read it. I think two stars is generous.   
 At the time that I ordered this book, I had a natural inclination to be sympathetic with its author, since his reputation indicated that he and I had similar views about politics and the philosophy of science. That only increased my disappointment when this ended up being one of the least enlightening and most annoying books I've ever encountered.  If Berlinski is as talented as I'd been led to believe, it's hard not to interpret _Infinite Ascent_ as either some sort of practical joke or a rush job to fulfill a contract.  In _Infinite Ascent_, Berlinski has a tendency to wax grandiloquent, using metaphors and similes that serve no evident purpose and are sometimes downright bizarre, as when, for example, he likens sets and their elements to the male anatomy (p. 129).  Following this up one page later with Berlinski's fantasy about schoolgirls with "their starched shirt fronts covering their gently heaving bosoms" (p. 130) does nothing to ameliorate concern about the author's tendency to get distracted.  One of Berlinski's running themes is the use of "..." in mathematics to represent the continuation of a pattern.  He likes to joke about this so much that he starts inserting these dots in his formulas needlessly, just to get to comment on them.  For example, instead of just writing down the (extremely short) formula for subtracting complex numbers (p. 69), he leaves an ellipsis and then states that "the crutch of three dots [covers] the transmogrification of a plus to a minus sign and nothing more."  Some of Berlinski's comments are real head-stratchers: "[The Elements] is very clear, succint as a knife blade. And like every good textbook, it is incomprehensible." (p. 14);  "[Exponential functions] mount up inexorably, one reason that they are often used to represent doubling processes in biology, as when undergraduates divide uncontrollably within a Petri dish." (p. 71).  Huh?  _Infinite Ascent_ has few formulas or other concrete mathematical details, and what there is is often wrong.  The formulas for the solutions to quartic equations of quadratic type are botched (p. 93), roots of equations are confused with zeros of functions (p. 80), inscribed rectangles are described while circumscribed rectangles are drawn (p. 56), and g12*du1*du2 is misidentified as a formula for the infinitesimal distance between the points u1 and u2 (p. 120). The sections on logic are the ones Berlinski handles most competently, but even that has been covered better by many others.  Berlinski thinks that Weierstrass's definition of limit is "infinitely wearisome" (p. 145) and is "promptly forgotten" by mathematicians after they have learned it.  I think most analysts would disagree strongly with his opinion, and would classify the definition of limit among those things they couldn't forget if they wanted to.  (That Berlinski himself very well might have forgotten it is suggested by his unconventional decision to use the letter delta to represent a *large* index (p. 61) in his definition of the limit of a sequence.)  Berlinski opines that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (connecting differentiation to definite integration) is something that "no one at all would expect".  On the contrary, I consider it to be eminently plausible.  Berlinski also describes the classic math book _Counterexamples in Analysis_ as consisting of "a series of misleading proofs supporting theorems that are not theorems."  _Counterexamples in Analysis_ actually contains nothing of the sort. Rather than containing fallacious "proofs" of non-theorems, it contains exactly what its title says it does: Counterexamples (i.e., examples that show why the hypotheses of (true) theorems are necessary and why stronger conclusions are unwarranted). 
 If one reads this, they might do it with one of those foam collars about their necks that people use for whiplash, because that is precisely how you will feel when you finish this work.  It's not bad enough the writer gets SO many facts wrong, out of order or does about faces on her own statement - it's a marathon of WRONG - she actually and consistently contradicts herself!  One can write a small book on the errors this author carelessly makes.  Take this as TOTAL FICTION and you MIGHT enjoy it.  If you are looking for a feel for the period, look elsewhere.  Save your money - and the headache!  To see a writer do so much research and get it ALL so wrong, jumping around in chronological order with the consistency of a ping pong ball, had to be a fine madness.   I don't think someone could deliberately set out to get something so wrong and do half a thorough job as Murray did 
 This is an extremely cheap product (poor grade of plastic) and sound quality is...for the lack of a better word...gross! The earbuds that came with my ipod are 10 times better! It's on it's way back! STAY AWAY 
 This movie could have been summed up in 30 minutes. I fell asleep several times trying to get through it, good sleep aid, not such a great film. I had way higher expectations from watching the other AMAZING Miyazaki films. This movie isn't a bad edition to Miyazaki's portfolio, but it's not even close to his best 
 After enjoying "7 % solution" as a manna sent from heaven, I tasted stale bread in reading the aforesaid title. It was a huge let down, in terms of everything. The theatrical environs made the work overtly sensational and reduced Holmes' stature(can you imagine it?)to that of a novice trying to assess the world with the help of GBS. Sorry, but I just can not digest it 
 After hearing mountains of praise for Discworld, I thought I'd give it a go. This book has completely turned me off to continuing the series. Pratchett has failed the fantasy genre where Adams has suceeded for sci-fi. The humor was helter-skelter and it seemed that Pratchett tried (too) hard to offer nonchalant zaniness 
 I was thoroughly enjoying the romp through the Brooklyn of my youth  though somewhat skeptical  of the boy, Michael, believing in all the superheroes stuff while seeming to be quite levelheaded about the reality around him.  Then the ending made me wonder why I had wasted all that time reading the book.  Michael's refusal to report the atrocities to the police also didn't ring true and the heavy handed racism didn't help any either.  This could have been a very good book if the author either did it as straigh fantasy or straight reality.  Mixing the two is a cop-out 
 This book was not in the same league of Frazier's first effort.  I found myself not caring about the characters and basically wanting the book to end.  The lack of a plot would be fine if you could get caught up in the character or lost in the beauty of the language but the writing is so overblown and tedious the fact that nothing much is happening stands out.  I really wanted to like this book and I was trying hard to like it as I read it but the fact of the matter is, this is a bad book 
 Contrary to the maker's claims, this product is not made with whole-grain flour. Instead, the first-listed ingredient is "organic unbleached wheat flour," an unhealthful, refined carbohydrate. The product is sweetened with common, refined cane sugar and corn syrup. All things considered, this product is nutritionally equivalent to common grocery-store fig newtons, except for the claim that it's "organic." Snacks like this could be made with healthful, nutritious ingredients; unfortunately, this one is not. I would not choose to buy it again. Instead of this junk snack, I would choose Barbara's Whole Wheat Fig Bars, which are made with real whole grains and sweetened with fruit juices 
 Hart disputes O'Reilly's claim that the US "gives far and away more tax money for foreign coutries than anyone else....." by countering that per capita the U.S. is near the bottom of the list. O'Reilly wasn't quoted as saying "more tax money per capita".  More goofy reasoning by someone who ought to know better.   
 I found this book somewhat helpful when planning a trip to San Francisco. It has a lot of information about sightseeing, eating out and accomodations. However, it is sorely lacking in visual stimulation including pictures of the destination and maps. I foresaw the lack of a decent map being a huge problem once in SF and decided to get a Lonely Planet guide to supplement this one.   Overall, I found the Lonely Planet SF guide much easier to use and definitely more entertaining to look at. If you're going to SF and need to purchase a good guide book, I'd go with that one. This one will suffice if it is all you can find but if other options are available, think twice before purchasing 
 Like the idea of getting some samples, but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles.   Do not buy. 
 This book was a required text for my first semester of the Economics PhD core. I found the book to be a terrible disaster. Supposedly this book is a more basic approach to advanced macroeconomics, but I found I comprehended higher-level texts with greater ease than this book. The wording is very obtuse, which makes understanding the verbage difficult.  Once you get past the words and understand the meaning, however, the explanations are also very inadequate given the complexity of the material.   All in all, I have read my fair share of poorly-written textbooks, but I think this one tops them all 
 I have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and I have become very skeptical of much of its advice.  This advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g. the US Dairy Industry (there is always at least one of those annoying "got milk" ads) and not surprisingly, every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products (e.g. milk and cheese).  However having read many books on nutrition, it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the The China Study by Colin Campbell, an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the US dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public's perception of the healthfulness of its products.  It is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers' paychecks.  The magazine also appears to be very similar to Prevention magazine which I also have subscribed to and I would make the same criticism of.  My advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent "Berkeley Wellness Letter" that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the US Dairy Industry 
 I am required to use this text for an introductory EE course for non-EE majors at my university. The text is at times nearly cryptic (especially FETs), does not give enough examples, and unfortunately most of the problems in the book do not have answers (some are online.) And, in general, I feel unprepared academically to answer the end-of-chapter problems after reading the chapter and doing the (very few) examples. I have done online searches on some of the subjects in this book and come across free webpages with FAR better explanations. If you learn by doing problems, don't waste your money here. 
 I truly am the target audience for this book - a novice. The problem with this book - the author is not thinking of the beginner. He jumps in and starts refering to components before explaining what each component is. You don't teach reading before you teach the alphabet. Sometimes a book needs to be edited by a novice and not an expert 
 First of all, let me say that I love the work of Émile Zola. I have read all twenty novels in the Rougon-Macquart saga, and I have to say that in my opinion this is the worst book in the series. The plot revolves around a love triangle between Aristide Saccard (born Aristide Rougon), his second wife Renée, and his son Maxime by his previous marriage. The story takes place in Paris, as Saccard is undertaking a series of shady dealings to amass his fortune. I've always felt that Zola's brand of Naturalism, with its hyper-realistic accumulation of sensory detail, works better when he's dealing with the lower classes than with rich Parisians. In this book his observational thoroughness takes the form of long detailed descriptions of elegant dinner parties and lavishly furnished mansions. All this opulence goes to illustrate the pervasive greed and decadence of the times, but its still rather dull to read through. I imagine the love triangle itself had some shock value for readers of its time, but not so for today's reader. It's hard to take an active interest in any of the three main characters, since they are all so unlikeable. By unlikeable I don't just mean that they're morally reprehensible; they're also not very interesting. Renée is prone to tedious histrionics. Maxime is an ineffectual bore. Saccard is by far the most interesting of the three, but Zola doesn't give him as much ink as the other two. Zola develops the Saccard character much more fully in the far better novel entitled Money (L'Argent). French history enthusiasts will be interested in Saccard's financial endeavors. At a time when Napoleon III and Baron Hausmann are tearing down neighborhoods to make way for grand boulevards, Saccard uses insider information and a knack for wheeling and dealing to profit from all the destruction. I think this novel should only be read by those completists who want to read the entire Rougon-Macquart cycle. For anyone else, there are so many other far-better Zola books (Germinal, The Earth, L'Assomoir, The Debacle, Pot-Bouille, to name a few); don't waste your time on this one 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 First of all I am a big fan of this band.  However, this CD left me greatly disappointed.  It is not immediate or catchy except for a few songs - that unfortunately, after a few listens, emerge as false hope - for they also leave a lot to be desired.  Even after repeated listens on my part in an effort to give it a chance to grow on me, it never did.  Maybe for comparison purposes you could say this album is of a similar vein to the self-titled 1992 effort King's X ... but not even in the ballpark.  Try Gretchen, Out of the Silent Planet, Dogman, or King's X for their best.  I even liked Bulbous and Manic Moonlight, but this one is summed up in one word ... DUL 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 Will, a neoconservative often mistaken for a conservative of the old mold, presents his case for the Leviathan state.  To Will, if government is good, then more government is better.  He sees the state as the rightful architect of society, trusting politicians and bureaucrats to steer the proles along the path to greatness, meaning Empire.  I regard neoconservatives as Judas goats;  Will is a prime example.  This is the man who, a few years ago, said that it is time America repealed "the embarrassing Second Amendment.&quot 
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 The clock itself works well. It did take till sometime during the middle of the night for the atomic time to connect (we set a backup alarm the first night). The idea of utilizing atomic time for an alarm is a fantastic idea, but why would Scott put such a lousy tuner in an atomic clock radio?  Doesn't make sense to me.  Granted, I live in a rural area, but I am able to receive both AM and FM stations from as far away as Fresno, some 50 miles away, on other radios in the house (including a small portable, battery-operated one), and we do have a local FM station.  The tuner is so sensitive that I had to use both hands to steady the dial when trying to tune in a station.  I am unable to receive one static-free AM station, and I eventually, very gingerly, dialed in two fairly clear FM stations (one Spanish-speaking from Fresno, one local), but neither stay tuned in overnight..by morning when the alarm goes off, nothing but static.  A strange thing though...once, while trying to locate a station, I received a fairly clear one from SALT LAKE CITY....wow!  I plan to return the product 
 An Overview of Marketing , The Marketing Environment and Marketing Ethics,Consumer Decision Markin 
 This book has some good points to make and helpful resources to list, and offers badly-needed clarification of what "classical" really means.  On the other hand, there are problems with the curriculum suggestions: 1) overemphasis on mythology and lack of emphasis on Christian doctrine; 2) a serious oversight in the history recommendations--little or no Middle Ages and Renaissance coverage; 3) it's clear this is for a school-at-home style, not a true homeschool approach.  If you want your kids to learn Latin and LOVE IT, then use natural method books such as "Minimus" (Cambridge), Oerberg's "Lingua Latina," or "Ecce Romani," not textbooks which are going to mean boredom and frustration.  Finally, emphasis on pagan culture, methods and authors needs to be carefully considered by serious Christian educators.  Where does true wisdom come from? Yes, the Greeks had some share in it, but isn't the full truth from God? As for human excellence, it should be obvious that the great men of antiquity are not much compared to the heroes of Christian history. Let us be Christians first and classicists second!  A reading of St. Augustine's "On Christian Doctrine" would be worthwhile for anyone who wants clarity on the proper Christian approach to pagan authors. 
 A tough read.  Way too many details and she is all over the place.  I bought tghis book as a required text for a class and I would not recommend it again 
 This book struck me because it appears to address a wide issue in depth.  Unfortunately, the introduction only gives a few brief details about the authors of the book, who include mainly interested writers, as far as I can tell.  As a former history major, I have often come across examples of exhaustive research; unfortunately, this book cannot fall under that criterion.  Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln are not trained scholars and their mildly critical perspective leads to some interesting logical jumps.  Unfortunately, the authors will posit a claim with only one source to support their argument.  This sort of specious scholarship allows the writer many freedoms in terms of the conclusions he can come to, because of the lack of acknowledgment of conflicting sources which would heap contrary evidence on his weak claims.  Overall, the book is neither terribly interesting nor well-researched.  This is like if the Da Vinci Code were a restaurant and Holy Blood, Holy Grail were the menu.  It seems appetizing but there isn't any substance or sauce to entertain the taste-buds.  
 I purchased this back in 1982 for £13.99 ( a fortune for an unemployed 20yr old back then) as a Japanese Import.  It was my most eagerly awaited and most disappointing music purchase ever. A limp performance, Gary Barden just didn't seem to cut it(apparently he wes too nervous facing 10000 at the venue and his vocals had to be redubbed) and Michael Schenker was good but below-par. In my opinion, there is nothing to recommend this album, the tracks sounded better on the two studio albums-it is certainly no "Strangers in the Night". One for completeness of collections only 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 Book contains many useful lists / charts / comparisons to define giftedness.  Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child.  Main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general -- and  may push those with "normal" kids into thinking they have gifted  ones and down that track -- when they should not. Gifted kids are the  exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 	Sally Denton's Faith and Betrayal is a disappointing book. It promised all the elements of an exceptionally dramatic (and true) story: love and loss, wealth and poverty, dedication and disillusionment, an epic journey, a peculiar religion, polygamy, theocracy, a massacre, and perhaps betrayal. But Denton's account is so replete with inaccuracies and confusion of facts that it destroys all credibility. Listing her errors would take nearly as many pages as the book itself. In addition she failed to use the richest repository of primary sources of Mormon history-the LDS Church Historical Department Archives. Presumably this is because she assumed she would not be welcome, she believed the records there had been selectively censored, or she thought they would have little relevance.  	As a non-Mormon historian working on the stories of disillusioned converts in the same period of the mid-nineteenth century, I can assure her that for the past decade I have never been refused generous help in the Church Archives and have found the records there amazingly rich, especially the correspondence of Brigham Young and the diaries of contemporaries of those who left the church.  	Denton makes Jean Rio's piano a pivotal issue, which she says was brought to Utah in 1851, though Jean Rio never mentions it in her trip diary nor does the captain of the company she traveled with in his (which is in the Church Archives). Denton fails to give a source for her account of it. It is quite possible Jean Rio ordered the piano later after her arrival in Salt Lake and had it shipped from the East. As for the tar-covered crate (p. 165), if that is in a museum in California, could not have Denton done the research to find where it is?  	Was Jean Rio's piano taken by the church leaders through "consecration"-a rule of stewardship (pp. xvii, 129)? Did Denton bother to inquire in the Church Archives what the consecration records show? Not all records survived, but many did. It is unlikely the church purged them of information about the piano. Likewise, did Denton ever ask the staff at the Museum of Church History and Art about the provenance of the piano? One Jean Rio descendent believes it was gifted to the museum by a Mormon descendant. Here again Denton confuses her facts: She states (p. 130) that the piano is in the "Church Temple Museum"; there is no such institution.  	Denton claims the piano ended up in the "Amelia Palace, the home of Young's favorite wife, a beautiful Englishwoman named Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning..." (p. 129). Here Denton has all too typically confused Young's so-called "favorite" wife Harriet Amelia Folsom with a later wife, Ann Eliza. Neither were English. The Gardo House, the so-called "Amelia's Palace," was not finished until after Brigham Young's death; Amelia lived in it a short period to establish her claim in Young's will, while Ann Eliza never lived there.  	Denton quotes from one of my papers (pp. 153-54), and although the quote is correct, she misinterprets my account, stating "The flow of Mormon defectors had become the largest emigration to that point, far surpassing even the California gold rush." No records can support that idea. Likewise, she claims that "U.S. Army escorts oversaw a burgeoning traffic of disaffected Mormons fleeing Zion." There was only one such escort from Salt Lake of approximately forty families.  	Although a beautifully produced little book, publisher Alfred A. Knopf should be embarrassed at having accepted and published such a consistently unreliable "history." I'm sorry to advise potential readers not to waste their money 
 In spite of the hard work that has evidently gone into the writing of this book, the results are variable.  Too much irrelevant material gets a look in, and too much tedious commentary about Mrs Bee's after-life.  I feel somehow that Ms Hughes wanted to write something more meaningful, but was stumped by lack of firsthand evidence 
 Love the "doctor", but this abridged version has virtually no text to speak of. 2 or 3 flaps and that's it. Bores me AND my daughter to death 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 I disagree with nearly everything this book says.  And it leaves out a lot, too!  2 major points to consider are:  1) Reagan never actually had much to do with bringing down the Soviet Union - other than Reagan's profligate defense spending (which may have bankrupted the Soviet Army and nearly bankrupted us).  Even the patron saint of the neo-con movement, Frances Fukuyama, tells us the Soviet Union collapsed because of `its internal moral weaknesses and contradictions'.  In fact, Reagan and his coterie of criminals, thugs and arms dealers had far more interest in maintaining the Cold War status quo than in disturbing it, for therein lay their ability to defraud the American People and to profiteer.  "[George Kennan], the former US ambassador to the Soviet Union, and father of the theory of 'containment' of the same country, asserts that 'the suggestion that any United States administration had the power to influence decisively the course of a tremendous domestic political upheaval in another great country on another side of the globe is simply childish.' He contends that the extreme militarization of American policy strengthened hard-liners in the Soviet Union. 'Thus the general effect of Cold War extremism was to delay rather than hasten the great change that overtook the Soviet Union.'"  2) Schweizer ignores Reagan's organized crime connections - especially his dealings with Lew Wasserman and others at MCA.  Reagan's SAG deals with MCA sold-out the Guild which entrusted him with their futures - primarily becuase Reagan trusted Organized Crime figures far more than he trusted anyone else who used their money to gain influence over him.    3) Schweizer also conveniently ignores the S&L scandal which Reagan facilitated - a scandal which (much like George Bush's Enron scandal) bears the hallmarks of a mafia-style "bust-out" and put billion$ directly into the pockets of Neil Bush.  
 At first glance, this book appears to have omitted many useful equations.  I purchased it to save the trouble of preparing my own quick reference "cheat sheets".  Looks like I'll still have to prepare them 
 It just didn't do it for me.  Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading.  But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story.  He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.   Good writing?  Yes.  Interesting characters?  Somewhat.  Compelling plot?  No.   Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers.  Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with.  Maybe he just tried too hard. 
 He knows how to write, but unfortunately his grasp of reality is weak.  All the ills of the world can be attributed to the USA, where Chomsky has gotten rich and successful.  The self delusion in the book is amazing 
 Full disclosure:  I'm a guy, and I read this book at a time when, in my early 20's, I was trying to understand, and come to grips with, my perception that several of my relationships with women (some strictly platonic, some not) were crippled by a certain lack of honesty.  So feel free to discount my reaction to this book by whatever degree you feel appropriate, based on the perspective I brought to it. That said, I was disappointed and frustrated by what I found to be Lerner's somewhat shallow and defensive treatment of the topic.  I'm oversimplifying a bit, but Lerner's basic philosophy, as presented in the book, seems to be:  Dishonesty is often a good thing because not sharing hurtful truths can help you avoid hurting someone's feelings.  E.g., not telling a friend that you think certain behavior patterns are harmful or unpleasant serves the "greater truth" that you nevertheless care about her and think she's a good person.  Therefore, Lerner suggests, women who deceive the other people in their lives often aren't "really" lying, they're just being kind.  Lerner doesn't really confront the ultimately circular nature of this argument.  Nor does she provide any reasoned way of distinguishing between innocuous applications of this "if you mean well, it isn't really a lie" approach and more problematic ones.  Telling a friend that you really like her disastrous new haircut, about which she's feeling self-conscious and vulnerable, is one thing.  Not telling her that you've been deliberately excluding her from certain social situations because your other friends find her manipulative or overly critical is something else entirely.  Nor does Lerner, IMHO, deal meaninfully with the question of whether deception that we rationalize on the grounds that it protects a friend from unpleasantness is not often, in reality, an attempt to protect ourselves from the emotional messiness of communicating hard truths.  These aren't easy issues, and I don't claim to know the "truth", or even that there is a single correct approach to dealing with them.  But I was disappointed by Lerner's failure to grapple honestly with them 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 Well, if giving up your favourite things such as alcohol, coffee, elevators, taxis, newspapers, cell phone, shopping, dining out, television, cursing, chocolate and multitasking seems difficult for you, think again. Carlomagno has written just the book to entice you to try giving up some of your favourite things - at least one thing for a month. In a whole year she managed to give up all the above, each for a month. Lessons to be learnt: she grew wiser in terms of giving street directions because she had to rely on buses. She grew to like tea when she gave up coffee. In giving up elevators, she felt more energetic when she walked up the stairs.   I do wish that Carlomagno had stuck to the "sacrifices" that she made. I mean, she only gave up each of the items for a month and then reverted back. Sure, cell phone and newspapers might be difficult things to give up forever, but what about television and cursing and elevators and even coffee. Surely these can be eliminated totally if she sets her mind on it? I mean if caffineated coffee is bad for health, one could switch to green tea (which is touted as a healthier choice) henceforth after having broken the need for coffee for a month.  Well, flaws notwithstanding, the items picked by Carlomagno could be jumpstarts for readers to follow. The pace of Carlomagno's book is fast and an easy read. I like the book size (7.4 x 6.5 x 0.8 inches).  Should you buy it? Probably not. Borrow it if you could. I know for sure our local library stocks this book. 
 I never received this book.  A notice was sent to me saying the book was unattainable at this time 
 Probably my least favourite of the books I have read by this author. And I love him, I do. Just not this one.  The bit on the back sounds really good, "crazy rain making people into savage killers!" Neat. But the book isn't that good, it really isn't. It's BORING. I don't know how it's possible for crazy rain making people into savage killers to be boring, but it is.  I will never be convinced that if a woman has been raped, her clothes ripped off during an attack, or there's a naked female corpse, that apparently ALL males nearby will become sexually excited. I mean... you're under attack by crazy, slime-covered maniacs, your wife is freaking out, your child is home with the babysitter and you don't know if she's okay, people are being disemboweled and torn to pieces around you... and you're still going to take the time (much less be able) to become excited at the sight of a half-dressed woman?  Also ridiculous is the fact that when the character John realizes that the maniacs can be "cured", he still rampantly and without remorse shoots them in the head and kills them. Hmmm.  I don't even want to get into the fact that Richard Laymon talks about the little 8 year old girl's "panties". Not cool. He always does this in his books, "rumps" and "panties"... but my god. This is supposed to be a CHILD. Pretty gross.  This is not his goriest book, his most creepy, nor his most interesting. Not a good Laymon book at all. 
 Absolutely unwatchable. Cliche-ridden. So silly it's very nearly offensive. It's like watching one long music video by a B-level rapper - full of dumb, beautiful women, buff, monkey-headed ghetto thugs, and jokey tricked-out cars. Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is laughable, the acting worse. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are more "Dumb and Dumber" than "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". Awful 
 I enjoyed ric's other book "The truth about money", and decided to purchase this book as well.  Firstly, for someone who is looking for a tactical plan and something i can excute upon, this books provides very little help.  Only the last few chapter provided some relevant information, the rest of the book was focusing on the inspire readers to invest, not exactly what i looking for.  Secondly, a lot of the information is a rehash of the truth about money.  I do like ric like a financial advisor, but wouldn't recommend this boo 
 Of the 16 essays presented in this collection, only three were worth my time:  (1) Orson Scott Card's Introduction is a very informative and thoughtful analysis showing how TV has evolved over the last half-century and how LOST may be the next "evolutionary" step.  (2) Amy Brenner's "Double Locked" illustrates how the fictional character John Locke closely echoes the teachings of the real-life 16th century philosopher with the same name.  (3) Glenn Yeffeth's "The Art of Leadership" is the highlight of the collection, which discusses how Jack, Locke, and Sawyer are all really bad leaders. And it puts forth a pretty good argument that Hurley may be the best leader on the island.  Some of other 13 essays fall into the category of Comedy.  "The Same Damn Island" points out the show's similarities with Gilligan's Island.  "LOST Connections" attempts to concoct a conspiracy theory based on which actors have appeared on film together throughout their careers.  "The LOST Book Club" and "Have You Been Framed?" examine literary allusions and shared themes with classic works.  "LOST in Love" tries to analyze every love pairing on the show.  Surprisingly, only the essay "Game Theory" actually attempted to explain the mysteries; but I really hope the show doesn't turn out to be just one giant video game.  "Oops" and the Encyclopedia are both out of date, due to events that been aired since the publication of the book.  Overall, I guess I wanted more of these authors to present their theories to explain the mysteries.  Instead, I felt most of these pieces were just fluff and "talking head" analysis 
 This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read (listened to).  I was never able to find a plot, and even though no one ever had sex in the book, everyone was always thinking about it and wanting to.  Not very realistic.  And, sorry, Jonathan Morosz, but the narration couldn't have gotten any more monotone 
 I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining. 
 I bought this book based on the great reviews it has but the exercises did not ease my back pain. After suffering from back pain for over 20 years my hopes were getting lower and lower to find any relief. Going 3 years to the chiropractor helped somewhat but not really.  Reading another customer review I came across some exercises by DonTigny that correct commonly overlooked sacroiliac joint partial dislocation. This condition is most often overlooked as a source of severe and constant back pain. Even better you can download the program for free. Just google Richard Louis DonTigny home program.  This condition was totally unknown to me but after doing the exercises a few times something popped in my hip area and my back pain started to ease. Now 4 months later I am still pain free and can cut my own fire wood again something that was before simply out of the question.  If the Book Pain Free helps your back pain great ... if not maybe give Richard Louis DonTigny free exercises a try I am certainly glad that I did 
 With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated 
 I felt that the writer tried too hard to be hip, cool and funny and because of this, it was difficult to read this book.  I found myself searching for the next "excruciatingly contrived hip, cool phrase"; thereby I wasn't concentrating on the storyline 
 I love Yvonne Porcella's work.  It has a distinctive look, filled with simple shapes and bright primary colors.  Sadly, most of that is missing in this book.  I can just hear the publisher telling her to use varied palettes to appeal to more people.  Who knows? Maybe she will.  But somehow I can't see the repro and plaid crowd wanting to make her freeform quilts. If they want to, there are instructions for how to assemble a conglomeration of 4-patch and 9-patch units with spacer strips.  In trying to please everyone, the book ended up being neither traditional nor contemporary and all the magic is missing 
  i read the first 3 books or atleast tryed and i have to say that these books are the MOST boring books in the world. it takes so many ideas from lotr and its very confusing and hard to follow. i read the first thinking it was going to be good which it kinda was so i bought the whole series(big waste of money sence they just sit on my self collecting dust). the reason its confusings is it just moves from finding the disk and trying to dicifer them but never explaind anything about them after book 1. its so boring because it just gos on and on about with no real plot point so save ur money and buy something worthe while    if u have any comments about this u can contact me at (... 
 I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book 
 The much-maligned movie of GYPSY is not hard to watch or enjoy.  Still, you have a sense you are seeing a late-run replacement cast instead of the genuine original.  Merman.  The legend grows and grows about her powerful performance on Broadway.  Judging from the Broadway cast album she sure sang the hell out of each number: She was heading into her angry years and maybe channelled some of that ferocity into the role.  I have never heard anyone say that she acted the role particulary well.  An audio tape exists of her closing night performance and she seems to be racing through the show and (as was her habit) playing her lines to the back rows of the audience instead of other actors on stage.  Still, the power she commanded is undeniable.  Had she made the film of GYPSY would it have been better or would the camaras have made her appear too oversized for the role?  (I am one of her biggest fans and had the privilage of recording an interview with her in 1979. But I think she worked best on stage and less well on TV and in the movies.)  Roz Russell.  It's not so much that she wasn't a singer. She does fine by the songs in WONDERFUL TOWN...although they were tailored to her range.  And she certainly was a gifted actress handling comedy as well as drama.  Her performance in the movie certainly shows the range, and the long film is a pretty good one. It is also very faithful to the Broadway script. The choice of Lisa Kirk to dub was well done as Kirk's husky voice is a good match for Russell's. (In her autobiography, Russell insists she did all her own singing. True she recorded everything, but Kirk was brought in to overdub a good deal of it in post production.) Listen to Russell's previously unheard vocal tracks and you'll hear a performer struggling with songs that are far out of her range.    I suspect a better director might have coaxed more nuanced performances from the stars. Watching the recent DVD I found the cast are still playing as if on stage.    The soundtrack album has always been a second choice.  The LP was issued shortly after the movie was released and stayed in print for the next ten years, but Merman's original cast recording always outsold it and still does!  So, WHY would you want this version? Well, the score is one of the best ever written for a musical, and the orchestrations are beefier. According to the original LP liner notes Jule Styne conducts the overture (heard complete on the soundtrack album, but heavily abridged to underscore the credits of the movie) but this may be just public relations puffery.  Rhino has given us the best sound possible....If you like that "boxy" Warner Bros soundtage sound. Drag queens have always loved the soundtrack take of "You Gotta Have  a Gimmick" maybe because the strippers singing it sound like drag queens themselves!  Otherwise nothing on this soundtrack disc matches the Merman original cast recording.  If you love the film, you probably already own it on video or DVD and can see the performers. Listening to these soundtrack recordings devoid of the visuals you will NOT have a real good time!     
 While well written this work is simply another example of historical revisionism. Not really worth the time.

 It's still friends so its still good, but please don't waste your money on this season guys. I have seen every season of Friends and own most of them except for Season 4 and this is the worst! If your looking for a good season of Friends, I suggest 2,5, or 6 
 I am a begining card reader, I ordered a three books. of those books, I liked the one by richard webster, and the one by jane lyle....I also ordered these cards........ I think these cards are garbage unless you want to send a friend a gag gift, but even then i'm still not sure... the meanings of the cards are written on each card, but they are not accurate. I love webster for the information on the reading and lyle for the interpretation. I think a smart card reader even as a beginner if they are in earnest, as I am will recognize that these cards are bunk... because they are. don't waste your money if you are serious about wanting to learn cartomancy. they are trash. period. and they feel bad. I am going to burn them 
 Because I could find the Baseball America Handbook and having seen one of my classmates with it, I decided to acquire it. Although it is not a completely waste, it is disappointing.  First of all, stats like wins, saves etc. are not listed. I think it is important to have some idea of the basic statistics. Secondly, I do not like the organization of players. They list players who have changed teams on their old teams, keep pitchers and position players separate which can be hard to follow at times.  My biggest complaint though is the fact that they seem convinced that they know everything and that they are funny. As a result, there are quite a few snarky comments when describing players like Alejandro Machado (Nationals) that is not even close to informative and their attacks on Pat Gillick and Jim Bowden are nothing short of vicious.  For a prospect handbook, this is disappointing 
 This book is an interesting read - for anyone who is not initiated into Palo Mayombe or Quimbanda! It represents Raul Canizares' OWN INTERPRETATION of these traditions and represents Palo and Kimbanda - yet again - as being "dark and mysterious"! To hyped-up for my taste! If you are interested in Palo, find a good Tata and study with him or stick with Lydia Cabrera's books. For anyone interested in the Brazilian Qimbanda/Kimbanda tradition, have a look at NA GIRA DO EXU by Mario dos Vento 
 This book had so many errors, the entire class including the instructor were confused.  It is very sad to see a textbook in its fifth or sixth edition with so many mistakes.  Many of the questions at the end of the chapter are so poorly written, that there was no solution.  Clearly, the authors had a goal and a message to convey, but because there was no attention to detail, the message was muddy at best.  I remain disenchanted with the general quality of textbooks, but this is one of the worst examples of a textbook I have ever seen.  Come on America, educate 
 I have 2 small businesses. I own rental property and work freelance. I'm also a professor, so I receive a pay check.  This book slides over some important and expensive details. For instance, it barely mentions that a home office must be used exclusively for you business. According to the tax man, it cannot be the guest room, too. And the author suggests setting up a trust to protect assests, without discussing the cost (not small) of that. These are just examples. Since there are problems with the information I have experience with, I wonder if the information I'm ignorant about is correct 
 I returned the entire Motorola C51 system. It kept droppong cell phone calls. I then purchased the Panasonic KX-TH111 and it works great 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 They were very cheaply made,Thank goodness they were just for little girls,I would have been embarrassed if I'd have ordered them for a gift for someone.I know I shouldn't expect alot for $5., but I'd have thought they'd be better than they were 
 If you get this used, you won't mind so much that it repeats itself too often and runs out of steam halfway.  I think I am much swayed by the photos, this is a coffee-table book, not a reference book.  I am boggled at the typography decisions, I suppose someone has been reading too much WIRED and thought it looked avant garde.  It does reek.   If you are much into the subject I'd say you will find something to enrich you here, esp if you can get a good deal on the book somewhere 
 This book is a very descriptive book on anatomy and the author covers the human body in great detail and provides many examples and good illustrations. Here's why I only gave it 2 stars.  This book is NOT an easy read by any means. It is truly college level reading material. I am a student majoring in Nursing and I have to tell you that the author does not do an adequate job of simplifying the material, which gets VERY complex in later chapters. Frequently throughout the text when describing something, say an organ, he will give you every last ounce of info on that organ but truly fail to tell you the BASIC FUNCTION that it performs. He uses a page of text when a paragraph will do. I frequenlty had to have a dictionary by my side reading this. Many of my classmates shared the same opinion.  He  does not "Dumb it down" so to speak for an average person who is reading this. Frederick Martini's version of Anatomy is much better. He really simplifies the complex concepts and his way of writing is much more decipherable and READER FRIENDLY  than Saladin's. Many college students I know have struggled  mightily reading through Saladin's technical writing and wish they had a  simpler book to read. I probably would have done much better in my anatomy classes had they issued us a better textbook than this complex, indecipherable encyclopedia 
 This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever witnessed...gay or straight. I am amazed it actually got made, let alone distributed! I hate to be mean, but it was hard to watch Ms. Lesnick. Her talents must lay elsewhere. She can not act her way out of a box. Oy!! She should have stuck to her Rabbinical Studies. Seriously folks....you should just rent it to see how bad it is...you will be fascinated. I am sure Helen Lesnick is a lovely hard working woman, but what a flat actress. Her heavy black and blue makeup made her look like a Drag Queen and the fact that she says she's 34 in the film is insane! She clearly looked 45 +. I am all for accepting yourself as you age, but the woman had such deep lines in her face, she looked like road map. If you force us to stare at your face for 2 hrs (and tons of annoying Close Ups!! Oy again!)please consider Boxtex next time.  Well she got a film made and out there, starring herself as the lead. I am sure a great accomplishment for her...BUT, PAINFUL for us.   
 The layout of the text is monotonous The content is below average as compared to many other physical exam texts, important exam techniques like ober's test, acetabular stress test, patrick's test etc are not  dealt with adequately Poor bu 
 I think there is probably a chance that this is the most poorly written textbook I've ever encountered.  I was going to hold off giving it a bad review until I got through the class, but at this rate I'm not even totally sure I will. I've just re-read the difference between nominal and effective interest for (no hyperbole) the 10th time, and I'm no closer to understanding it. Bad examples, useless derivations, poor explaining. I only wish I could give it a zero 
 Somebody tell me if I got a defective copy because all of the audio tracks are awful!  The show is very well filmed but the sound is tiny.  No matter what I did to my amp in terms of volume and equalization, the sound was small and distant.  Turning it up did not make it any better.  The crowd noises were almost louder than the band and the drums are almost non-existent.  Stick with the 1999 German "America in concert" DVD, that has much, much better audio.  Skip this, I don't know what audio remixing they did to this 
 don't buy this book, no substance only good for sale 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 This is a good example of the typical self-delusion of creationism passing as serious thought.  All the book really proves in its pages is that if a person wishes something to be so badly enough, it will become so, but only in his or her own mind.  The stratigraphic "evidence" is selectively presented in a distortive, inaccurate fashion, so as to suit conclusions previously reached.  The serious reader on the subject is far better advised to read Kurten's "Not From the Apes", and not some drivel like this book 
 This is one of many required books for my class on Applied Simulation.   I did not like the book. I thought the author was a "windbag". If you must buy it get a used version.   A better book to read is definitely Jared Diamond's " Guns, Germs and Steel" Excellent!  and  "Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace"   by Janet H. Murra 
 Having loved both the Arthur Waley and Edward Seidensticker versions of The Tale of Genji as well as the bits and pieces of Murasaki Shikibu's classical Japanese I had hammered through as a graduate student in East Asian studies, I was thrilled to hear that someone had done a "stunning" new translation of this work I and so many other Genji fans regard as one of the greatest "novels" ever written. Fortunately, a friend of mine, who is also a Genji fan, had the foresight to forward me some random passages of the Tyler version before I actually shelled out any money. In comparing these quotes to the Waley and Seidensticker versions I was much surprised to find that the Tyler translation comes up short in almost every regard, and that even Seidensticker's version, engaging as it is, is somewhat disappointing. Compare their respective translations of this short passage from a scene in Chapter Five ("Murasaki"), where Genji is visiting a Buddhist monastery in the mountains:  Waley's version:  Genji felt very disconsolate. It had begun to rain; a cold wind blew across the hill, carrying with it the sound of a waterfall--audible till then as a gentle intermittent plashing, but now a mighty roar; and with it, somnolently rising and falling, mingled the monotonous chanting of the scriptures. Even the most unimpressionable nature would have been plunged into melancholy by such surroundings. How much the more so Prince Genji, as he lay sleepless on his bed, continually planning and counter-planning.   Seidensticker's version: Genji was not feeling well. A shower passed on a chilly mountain wind, and the sound of the waterfall was higher. Intermittently came a rather sleepy voice, solemn and somehow ominous, reading a sacred text. The most insensitive of men would have been aroused by the scene. Genji was unable to sleep.  Tyler's version:  Genji felt quite unwell, and besides, it was now raining a little, a cold mountain wind had set in to blow, and the pool beneath the waterfall had risen until the roar was louder than before. The eerie swelling and dying of somnolent voices chanting the scriptures could hardly fail in such a setting to move the most casual visitor. No wonder Genji, who had so much to ponder, could not sleep.  There is no doubt Waley embellished the text, but it was clearly in the interest of conveying a sense of the exquisite poetry of Murasaki's prose. His elevated diction lends just that touch of "class" we would expect to find in an author writing for an aristocratic audience for whom style was everything. Moreover, the sumptuous musicality of his phrasing continually underscores the melancholy atmosphere even as it seems to echo the sound of the waterfall and the chanting. Seidensticker's version has the virtue of concision, but his choice of words is often questionable: "reading," for example, suggests that Buddhist monks read the sutras in private meditation rather than chanted them as a group prayer. His "sacred texts," on the other hand, implies that Genji wasn't very familiar with Buddhism, which could hardly be further from the truth. It was as central to his life and worldview as Catholicism was to the Italian princes of the Middle Ages, as Waley's "scriptures" implies. The phrase "aroused by the scene" is even more ill-chosen, for it suggests that Genji found visits to mountain temples erotically stimulating, when in fact they tended to have the opposite effect, for they reminded him of the vanity of his secular pursuits, which were, by and large, erotic.   Tyler's version follows Waley's interpretation at this point and thus avoids these particular problems, but he has others that are even worse. His "a cold mountain wind had set in to blow," for example, is dreadfully clumsy and somewhat confusing, as is his "the pool beneath the waterfall had risen until the roar was louder than before". The latter illogically suggests that it was the increased height of the pool below the waterfall that made the roar louder rather than the increase in the volume of water flowing over the falls due to the rain that had passed. A good many phrases in the other passages I sampled from the Tyler volume had similar kinds of problems, which makes me wonder if Tyler's editors ever bothered to read the work they insist is so "stunning."  If any version deserves that praise it is Waley's, which may be difficult to find, but it is well worth the effort 
 It took almost a month the actually get what I ordered. I was charged for them the day after I bought them and heard nothing from the company for over two weeks... then it said it shipped... but a week later there was still no tracking number and no package. Very dissapointed in the customer service... at least I got what I ordered 
 This so-called "Way of Knowledge" is certainly not a "Way of Wisdom." Before we delve too deeply in these ideas of "becoming a man of knowledge" and all the wacky implications of "alternative realities," let's not forget that knowledge is one thing, and wisdom is quite another. Knowledge is knowing about things - facts, you might say. Wisdom, on the other hand, is knowing how to apply these facts in a sensible way to our own lives. Whenever something like this comes around, we must ask ourselves this question: Is it really wise to throw commonly held, proven, and traditional wisdom in favor of some new, "revolutionary" claims to knowledge?  As far as I am concerned, this don Juan is little more than a 20th century witch-doctor who has smoked too much weed for his own good. Whenever you read an author who is proporting that hallucinogenic drugs can give you knowledge, remember this little tidbit of proven, scientific, empirical information - drugs kill brain cells. His theories of overcoming the "4 enemies" are certainly intriguing. That is, they hold a great deal of truth in any aspect of life, for any human endeavor. The problem is, the endeavor that is undertaken in this book is experimenting with illicit drugs in order to "understand" an ambiguous form of "knowledge" and "reality" that we do not ordinarily percieve. Well of course! When you get yourself high, you hallucinate and see weird stuff. So do people with mental disorders. It's called a disorder for a reason, folks.  While this book may be readable, intriguing, and at times fascinating, I don't buy into a bit of it. Books about Mexican drug-lords posturing as wizards and wiseguys are not for me. I'll stick to the classics, thank you very much - to quality literature that has proven itself to be true over the span of time.  The 1960's were a period of temporary insanity in our culture. In 2006, we've learned the error of our ways, grown up, and sobered up. Let's leave this experimental nonsense where it belongs: in the funny farm 
 I ordered this book having loved some other for dummies books.  Thank goodness I ordered several other saltwater tank books.  As I was picking through each of them I noticed that the for Dummies book contained information that completely contradicted the others!  I was so angry at the wrong information in this book that I sent it back at a $5.00 loss.  I'm actually considering checking some of my other for dummies books for errors.  Yes, the language is simpler than in other books, but the amount of wrong information is not worth the cost of the book.  Buy this if you want to kill some fish 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story. 
 After reading so many rave reviews, I decided to buy this video. I  owe many, many workout videos and this is the most boring by far. I have never been able to complete it. Very dissapointing! 
 I really thought I was getting a score. This is NOT a score. This is a libretto only. A previous review by a customer was misleading, and the description of the product not clear. This is NOT a score. No music, only lyrics.  
 What has happened to the Anna Pigeon in Track of the Cat, Superior Death, Firestorm, Blind Descent, Ill Wind? That delightfully flawed character? Why has Ms. Barr been so fixated on teen angst, rednecks, drugs & their ilk? Where is the Ranger who found it sometimes "embarrassing to be human",(a line I still use from time to time). Where is all the politics between the NPS & the Forestry, before Anna was "Boss"?   In High Country we have Anna impersonating a waitress in Yosemite NP as part of an undercover assignment. Aside from a collection of the sleaziest, foulest-mouthed characters you'd never want to meet, we have four missing teens who may or may not be victims of foul play, two chefs & an assortment of fellow waitresses who may or may not be on the level-and do we really care?  Personally, as a former die-hard Anna Pigeon fan, I feel that this is Nevada's worst Anna Pigeon yet, & it hurts to say it. As others have mentioned, she doesn't paint a very desirable picture of Yosemite-I didn't get the feeling I had been there the way I did with her earlier books. In Firestorm, I almost felt ashes on my clothing & in Blind Descent, I had that claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in small spaces & so on. Maybe it is because it was set in winter-which I would think would be a spectacular time in any National Park-it paints the whole atmosphere with brooding strokes. Nevada Barr is obviously seeing a different place than Ansel Adams saw through his camera lens! Anna always did survive planned "mishaps" in superhero fashion, but we loved her & wanted her to survive. High Country almost goes beyond superwoman! The incident with the deer was completely uncalled for. I also felt that mentioning the real life murders was in bad taste & beside the point of the story (not that there was much point.)   This reader has gone from waiting with great anticipation for each new adventure, wondering where I'll be transported next, to ho hum; maybe I'll wait until I can get a good price on the paperback. I understand that her next book is set in Rocky Mountain NP, a park near & dear to my heart. It will be interesting to see if I recognize it. Nevada, please bring back the old Anna Pigeon-flaws & all.  
 I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of "Meet John Doe".  The poor quality DVD that I bought has a cover that looked like this: [... 
 Verbose, annoyingly pedantic, and rarely to the point, this text is a disaster from start to finish. For students who have little to no research experience it will be overwhelming in detail (unless you find reading formal style manuals to be a joy). On the contrary, for the more seasoned researcher certain sections will likely appear dubious or downright wrong, insofar as the text has a strong bias towards a certain social scientific approach (which is subject to learned academic debate, a point students should be made aware of). It essentially presents the research process as take it or leave it, encouraging a investigative framework that leads to inevitably trite conclusions. Additionally, it reads like a car manual with many sections repeated verbatim when the need arises for them to be referenced a second time. Finally, it uses examples of students work that are of questionable quality as positive examples, rather than well written, notable published pieces.   In conclusion, this would never be an appropriate guide for a students at elite research universities, nor would it be an efficient approach for students at less vaunted programs. 
 If you expect quality metal, do not waste your money on this one...All songs sound the same, the vocals are terrible, the guiter work is mediocre... Of course I enjoy the likes of Metallica, Megadeth, Overkill, Sepultura etc., and this is arguably one of the worst Metal CDs I have heard 
 Although this book would appear to have a lot of promise, it ultimately fails. Like Mr. Taylor's self-proclaimed "Certified Professional Landlord" title (Fill in your name on page 218 for your own bogus certification!), these phony forms are imaginative but have little to no legal standing. Worse, Taylor apparently has little respect for his tenants. One form, the "Tenant Late Rent Warning and Excuses" form ("To be given to new, renewing, and late tenants.") asks tenants to mark a box as to why their rent was late. Sample excuses: I was mugged. "You didn't come by when I had the money," "I didn't have a stamp," "I'm dead." A chuckle for a landlord, but also a cynical and unprofessional suggestion. Taylor's advice on handling phone calls from prospective residents is even worse - he promotes using a hard-sell interrogation on the first contact that seems destined to drive away prospective tenants. Anyone with intentions to do good business would be well served to get more professional advice than this extremely disappointing book 
 I read this book as a part of a college class on marginalized/minority writers.  Out of a class of eight, I and another girl both thought this fellow was an unmitigated whiner and the book was terrible.  The rest of the class thought it was compelling and thought provoking (or else they just wanted a good grade that week.)  It seems to me that it is almost forbidden to express dislike of a minority writer in a classroom environment these days for fear of being branded a racist.  I did not like this book.  I was in the minority--read it and decide for yourself.  
 I'm a psychiatric nurse. Peter Breggin is well known in the field of psychiatric medicine as being anti-all drugs.  Has prozac been overprescribed or mis-prescribed? sure. but this drug and the class it belongs to have helped WAY more people than they hurt. penicillin and other antibiotics can kill you too if you're allergic and don't know it. and antibiotics are WAY over prescribed if you ask me and other professionals. i've worked in state psychiatric hospitals and i've seen a LOT of people who only got out and back to the world because of medication.  i would hate to think that a book like this would turn back the clock to the old days when there was no medication and people wasted their whole lives in the hospital. GET A GRIP: ANYthing you put in your body has side effects and you can die from taking too much Tylenol, too. picking on this drug is a cheap tric 
 I expected better from these authors.  They, however, left me very disappointed. I thought I'd get some basic and practical advice.  What I got was stroking and dreams topped off with a push for philanthropy from the earnings they don't tell you how to make.  I resent that Hansen and Allen made a dime off me for purchasing this book.  I should have read the reviews BEFORE I purchased. I would have saved myself time and money. Anyone what a free used copy?  Never mind.  It's not worth the postage 
 I can't write a review because I had to send both CD's back because they would not play.  I just ordered another one yesterday, and here's hoping that will be okay 
 I'm an MBA student in a top5 business school in the US, and we use this as our textbook for the basic stats course. I've only read the first 5 chapters so far, and I've found this book to be one of the worst textbooks I've seen since college. Some very simple concepts are explained in very confused (and confusing) language, the text is very arid and skips over most of the conceptual subtleties or fallacies that the unsuspecting user of statistical data may easily fall victim to. I strongly suggest leafing through it before deciding whether to buy it (you can start with chapter 2, which is pretty typical of the tone of the book and, being the 1st "substantial" chapter of the book, doesn't assume knowledge of concepts defined in previous chapters). 
 This is a poorly written and shallow treatment of X10 technology, most of the content is dated and corny. It is an attempt to cover both the technology and practical application of home automation, but does a poor job on both counts. There is a pointless section on how to build a box to store your remote control, and a geeky section on using motion sensors to turn on an outside waterfall or an indoor fake fireplace (does anybody really use an indoor fake fireplace?). Most of the useful information is a near verbatim copy of information from the wiring instructions supplied with X10 components at the time of purchase. This is the only book I have ever returned after purchase 
 Most radio shows will just play best of for free( btw Howard Stern invented the " BEST OF SHOW " ) ..to think he is selling it is very Bill O'Rielly.  Sellen crap to their audience taking advantage of their popular views to make a buck...vomit , puke 
 I love the other disturbed albums-this one though is somthing of a letdown. with the exeption of "liberate" its the same tune from begining to end.   Not great.   I love ten thousand fists though that whole album is teriffic 
 This book is a collection of vague and uninformative quotes, dated menus, and common sense advice.  One word for Ms Halvorsen, ICE.  The details of coffee and tea service are poured over, yet, at no time does the book remind the would-be caterer to buy ice!  It is amazing that in such a competitive publishing world that books like this are written 
 I could not have been more disappointed in a book! This book offers no real spritual inspiration. Maybe Frank Peretti has become enchanted by the Bigfoot legend but this book is far and away his worst. The plot is weak, character development is terrible and the ending is anti-climactic. Extremely disappointing!  Sometimes good authors feel obliged to publish a book, maybe he was pressured, who knows. This is even close to the same caliber of Piercing the Darkness or This Present Darkness 
 I bought three of these for my two 6 year olds and my 7 year old.  Every one of them arrived in abysmal condition.  Strings everywhere... loose tuning screws that could not be tightened... and scratches.  I could not believe that anyone would sell something this inferior.  Shocking is an understatement describing this purchase 
 My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either. 
 I was curious to read this translation of one of the greatest religious scriptures in the world by yet another westerner to see what wisdom he might possibly have to add to the numerous excellent translations written by so many excellent Hindu scholars and the answer is: little, if anything!  It is a real shame that westerners often miss the entire point of the Gita which is devotion to The Lord, instead feeling more "comfortable" and "politically correct" with the impersonalist mayavadi philosophy propounded by translators who have absolutely no concept of its profound message.  There is nothing to be gained by interpreting the Gita as some sort of psychological "inner struggle" or figurative mythology.  That is merely mind-stuff and drivel.  The Gita is exactly as it is written.  The Gita is not to be "walked through" casually - although that is a good start and hence the 2 star rating I have generously given this effort since it might encourage a reader to actually read a real translation of the Gita.  However, rather than reading dumbed down versions like this, I would encourage "westerners" to take the time to study the Gita, learn the Roman transliterations of the actual Sanskrit words and stop being so lazy as to having to be constantly spoon-fed - it really is rather pathetic.  Unfortunately I have yet to read a worthwhile translation of the Gita by any westerner and this one is no exception.  What's next, Bhagavad Gita for Dummies?  (Oh no, I can see it coming now... 
 when you reach the second half of life you need ginko biloba to remember what you did fifteen minutes ago. The meaning has always been there.Remember the golden rule - love your neighbor as yourself. Don't waste your money. I read this book and gave it as a gift. I liked it. But I can't remember anything about it 
 As someone involved in the consulting area for many years, I was unable to find any new idea that would make worthwhile to spend money in this book. Almost everything that is mentioned here can be grabbed from free articles availables in Internet,about this subject. Additionally, there are a good number of books that will help you much more to plan and implement ERP's. Last, but not least, the book only have a handful of small pictures and tables. Unacceptable for a modern book about business and technology topics 
 I can not agree with the other reviewer who rated this book so highly. It's most certainly the most unreliable biography ever written about Wilder, gossipy and not even entertaining. O.K, no book about Billy Wilder is really boring, there are too many anecdotes, true of false that can amuse the reader. But Wilder himself claimed that Zolotows book was - no! I just cannot cite him. In any case, the (real) life of Billy Wilder is too interesting and his (real) quotations too funny to rely on this book. I recommand Ed Sikovs Wilder biography instead. That's the way they should be 
 There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a "cult classic" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good?  Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really!  It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent.  The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh...   The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it 
 First, before I begin, I must say that Heinlein is one of my favorite authors. He is a science fiction grandmaster, and deserves the honor. He  wrote excellent works such as Starship Troopers, The puppet masters, and my  personal favorite: Jobe, a comedy of justice. However, this book is simply  bad!  The first story, Gulf, tells about a person (a spy) who discovers he  is a part of an advance subrace of human. The story has some interesting  ideas, and is actually quite good. The second story, Elsewhen, tells about  a group of people that can travel between various realities. It has  interesting ideas, however it is written *SO* badly, *SO* badly, the level  of writing is like a 7th grader. The characters aren't even two  dimensional... Maybe one dimensional, barely. The third story, Legacy,  tells about a scientists which try to develop uncharted parts of the brain,  because they believe it holds the key to superhuman abilities. Again, this  is horribly written, after reading half the story I realized I feel as if  I'm watching "Mystery Science Theatre 3000". It was just so  similar. I couldn't finish the story, it was that stupid. The fourth and  last story, Jerry was a man, tells about a future where it's possible to  create (almost) any kind of creature, with genetic engineering. I liked  this story, it had good ideas, and was short - and good. Overall, I think  this book is not worth it. I saw that all of these stories were written in  the 40s-50s, so they might actually be some of Heinlein's earliest work..  maybe that's why he doesn't shine in them. If you're really a fan, you can  get this book, but as a collection of stories it's simply bad. The 2 good  stories just aren't worth buying the entire book.  One last thing, if you  never read any other Heinlein book - go get one! He is one of the finest  science fiction writers, and one lousy book can't change that 
 I had high hopes for this book, having enjoyed Marcinko's various highly entertaining forays (most, after "Rogue Warrior" clearly labeled as "fiction") and "Patches" Watson's book, but I had misgivings about this from page one. Evidently, Harry's neighbor (the "as told to") was fascinated with Constance's war stories (and, really, who wouldn't be?), interviewed him and changed the tall tales to the first-person perspective. I found the technique clunky and obvious whenever the "real" writer's voice conflicted with the tales of derring-do (e.g., misidentifying the M-203 grenade launcher, calling it a ".two-oh-three, as though that was the launcher's caliber, or something, clearly shows the writer slavishly scribbling down as much of the stories as he could and doing little fact checking).   Now let's face it, anybody who had the balls to not only volunteer for membership in an elite group and who survived multiple tours in Vietnam is worthy of respect, but I actually wasn't terribly surprised to see that Constance's many accusation leveled at SEAL teammate Charlie Watson were untrue and he was forced to apologize in court (and pay nearly half a million dollars in damages). Much of the tone of the book seems to come from a sour-grapes guy with some scores to settle against former friends, colleagues and lovers. It's a shame that the obvious fraud and mean-spirited tone here taints the real-life Vietnam SEAL team heroics. 
 This book is a mess.  The thesis presented in the introduction is a rambling essay on the importance of followers and historical forces in leadership, which might leave the reader less informed about leadership  than before he/she read it.  What's worse is that the intro has nothing at  all to do with the rest of the book (which is marginal in it's own right).   The case studies are way too short and are made even less informative by  Wills habit of not even mentioning the leader until five or six pages of  nonsense. My overall feeling of this book is that it was poorly researched  and badly written.  I wonder (in all seriousness) whether Wills knows  anything at all about some of the people he writes about.  Skip this one. I  suggest Lincoln on Leadership instead: it provides the rudiments of  leadership with clear, well researched examples 
 This clock gains about 5 minutes every 4 days or so.  I have an old digital plug-in clock that keeps perfect time, but the alarm doesn't work.  I bought this one for the alarm, but usually have to reset the time to match the old plug-in about twice a week.  Also, if it gets dropped or knocked off the table, you have to reset the time.  I've had 2 or 3 other clocks of this type that keep perfect time, maybe gain a minute or two every 6 months.  I would not buy another Timex.  
 This dreary account of a foul-mouthed adulterer who consistently makes the wrong choices might remind some of other tragic characters in great fiction, such as the protagonist in An American Tragedy or in  Crime and Punishment or Madame Bovary.  But the difference here is that Bob Dubois never learns, he repeatedly does the dumb thing, whether it is adultery or use of dope or abusing his wife or his poor innocent children.  One can hardly help being disgusted by a man who does not seem to have a brain in his body.  Only a moron would break all the windows in his own car when he is short of money for his wife and kids, or wreck his home, or booze and do dope when he does not know how to pay for necessary care for his child.  As for all the stuff about voodoo this may be interest to some but to me was a bore.  Surely the account of the Haitians' plight is distressing, but it helps to make this book a depressing one.  Frankly I was glad when I finished this pretentious and not well-written book, and thought Dubois got what he asked for and deserved 
 I am a fan of most vampire and paranormal fiction but this is the first time I have read anything by Christine Feehan. This lady writes dialogue like a 12 year old. Dark Legend was the most repetitive and tedious book I've read in a long time. 
 Having no great fondness for B. F. to begin with, from the little I know of him and his work, I thought I'd give this a try just to see what the Grand Old Man of conditioned rats and pigeons had to say about Utopias.  What kind of Utopia would be imagined by some guy who saw no essential behavioral difference (and presumably no other important difference) between rats and humans?  As I had expected, I had a distinctly uneasy feeling about it well before finishing it-by about p. 60, in fact-but I couldn't clearly define or articulate it.  So, like anyone looking for easy answers, I Googled the book, and the first citation on the page was "A critical review of B.F. Skinner's philosophy, with focus on _Walden Two_", by Edward Rozycki (1999, based on a 1995 article for the journal _Educational Studies_).  And Rozycki made amply clear a few points which seem to have escaped all the raving enthusiasts of the book, such as:  (1) Skinner was a lousy scientist, who explicitly rejected some of the fundamental tenets of the scientific method, such as considering all the observed data.  In the book, Frazier says, "To go to all the trouble of running controls would be to make a fetish of scientific method."  Although Skinner kept telling everyone he was an empiricist and not a theorist, most of his work is basically theory based on what he chose to consider the world to be.    (2) His "vision" is fundamentally totalitarian (Roz tactfully avoids the term "fascist," but I would not be that polite).  As Frazier says, "Each of us has interests which conflict with the interests of everybody else. ...  Now, `everybody else' we call `society.'  It's a powerful opponent and it always wins."  Substitute "State" for "society" and that's pretty clear totalitarianism.    (3) The reason everybody in the community is so blissfully happy is that anyone who is not blissfully happy is made to feel unwelcome by the community and subtly cold-shouldered out.  About anyone who is "incorrigible," Frazier says that "it's more likely that he would long since have gone of his own accord."  As Rosycki dryly notes, "The point is not elaborated on."  I don't think it needs to be.  So, given my impression that Skinner's starry-eyed Utopian vision of a "culturally engineered" bliss of humanoid pigeons is one of the most terrifying things I've read since the daily news, I fail to see why everyone seems to think it's so wonderful.  I think it's a dreadful vision, just as dystopic, in its sinister way, as _Brave New World_.  And it's a boring read to boot 
 You can get all the same advice in this book from women's magazines. No new insights 
 Not what I expected! This shampoo soap ruined the texture of my hair. It has no conditioning whatsoever. I used the Jungle conditioner after the shampoo. It is equally hopeless! It is like the clothes washing soap you get in the villages of India! A waste of money, a lot of false advertising and a lot of hype. 
 This film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave. I originally saw it for free and afterwards, I still felt screwed. It stank so badly that I checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre. Yeah, I know. Call me "Mister Tact".  A "horror-comedy" that's neither slightly funny nor remotely scary, this film is a supposed sequel to the 1981 horror classic "An American Werewolf in London", (which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made). The filmakers had a lot to live up to and, boy, they blew it in every department. The effects were ludicrous, the cast was lost, the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues, and the director should have been shot (with something other than lots of narcotics). This film is a textbook example of the Hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew.  If you have already been suckered into buying this DVD, I feel your pain. You are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a Heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack 
 Aarf! Aarf!  This movie is a dog, and it's barking loud.  Unfortunately, I wasn't laughing loud.   The Wayans brothers are usually hilarious, I loved Scary Movie and Don't be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.  This one doesn't come close. I knew going in to this movie I'd have to disregard some believability factors.  FBI agents usually aren't poor fumbling idiots.  Plus, the Wayans had little resemblance to the real white chicks when they were in disguise.  I didn't have a problem with that though, since this is supposed to be a comedy. But this story seemed like a ripoff of the old Eddie Murphy skit from Saturday Night Live.  Some of the other jokes have been so overdone too, like farting scenes or crapping on the toilet scenes. Since this is the unrated version, I was hoping there might be some nice girl on girl action, a shower scene, a revealing dressing room scene.  Nope, none of this.  Just the reoccuring threat of manly love from a huge muscle-bound stalker, which I found quite a bit more disturbing than funny. In all fairness, my buddy laughed his head off during the entire movie.  I tried my best to laugh along with him, but couldn't.  I guess it's just a matter of preference.  I've heard Little Man is even worse than White Chicks, since it won a Razzie award for worst comedy.  I think I'll skip that one 
 I've never felt so ripped off by what I thought was a reputable company in my life.  The blade is so flimsy it tweaks with the first use and you wind up with a topsy turvy cake whether you wanted one or not.  A blind man with a baseball bat would have better success leveling a cake than this piece of junk 
 Some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all, but the Nikon 8400 has a "electronic viewfinder" and the reviews have been good and the price is great, so I bought the camera.  The electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash, you cannot see any expressions, just the outline of the person's head, so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder.  Outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot.   The "display" LCD monitor is small and washes out in sunlight.  The background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark.  After 3 days of use and 90 shots I mailed it back to "Ritz on Amazon" this morning, Dec 5.  They require it back "within 10 days of receipt of purchase", their "date of order" was Nov 29 and it arrived at my house on Dec 3.  It's a good thing I already had a compact flash card to use, there is not one in the box and if I had waited for the one I ordered to arrive, well, it's not here yet.  It cost me $11.65 to return it, insured, with 2 day delivery and a "delivery confirmation receipt".  The camera had some strengths as well as it's weaknesses, but with only a short time to try it out before the "10 days" ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what I was shooting I gave up on it 
 The following can be said about this album...rare?  All of you who are contemplating the purchase of this album should look the other way.  Chances are you already have all of these songs (except maybe Proud).  A final thought would be this, 'rare' doesn't even describe the album cover.  Turn it 90 degrees counterclock-wise....ever seen George Romero's "Land of the Dead" 
 I'm in Paris right now. And I have to admit, that before I arrived here, I had visions of berets, perfect stockings, cigarettes, and street accordions dancing in my head. But I'm getting this feeling that it is basically the same everywhere, at least in cities. There  will be large department stores, chains of McDonalds, KFC, Starbucks, homeless people, fat people, scruffy people. Which is of course a "duh". The characteristics that Ollivier attribute to French girls can really be seen everywhere; New York, Rome, London,  Chicago etc. Girls honestly look the same everywhere generally; boots with slim jeans or pants tucked in, wearing a short fitted jacket, yada yada. So really. Stop being such a poser. You're only embarrassing yourself by denouncing your origins and who you really are 
 Ok I bought this as the download version instead of the cassette because I thought I was buying the version that alan rickman reads. instead there is this awful robotic voice that you can hardly understand. I've read the book myself before and loved it and figured it would be that much more incredible hearing it read by someone with a brilliant voice but I was of course mistaken in thinking this was it. Buy the cassette version and don't waste your money on this download 
 I slogged my way through Chapter 4, got through Chapter 5 out of sheer curiousity, and then threw the book (trash) in the trash. 
 A Dickens Christmas story is meant to be read in front of the fire with children gathered 'round. As configured in this particular ebook format you cannot do anything but sit in front of your screen and read ninety pages of nineteenth century prose. Not useful at all! This ebook would be far more usefull if, for example, you could copy or print it onto holiday paper. Since this story is in the public domain, blocking those options in this ebook is silly 
 Excellent printing and binding - the text looks to be the professional work of a team - the reader is well drawn in - a great effort, but very artfully obscured are the facts that Syria was an independent nation just after WW1 - with internationally recognised and undisputed boundaries and a King enthroned - then France rapidly obtained a league of nations mandate - attacked Syrian troops and the King fled to the UK, in exile.   Subsequently, pieces of Syria were hacked off to form Palestine (in readiness for the later Israel), Trans-Jordan and Lebanon. Pieces were also give to Iraq and Turkey. Very un-Christian behaviour considering that Syrians fought shoulder-to-shoulder with us in WW1 to help defeat our enemies.  The author lays the Hindawi case firmly at Syria's door with a 'probable' authorisation by Assad. Victor Ostrovsky (former Mossad) says in his books that it was an Israeli false flag operation run by Mossad to break relations between the UK and Syria - and it worked.   Israel is treated in the text with a careful, almost fearful reverence, while Syria gets the usual just short of `evil people led by a wicked dictator' treatment. That is boringly predictable, not to mention academically emasculated - and demonstrates bad manners.  The book fails to reveal that Syria is absolutely controlled by twelve men from different families, and Assad is not one of those men. It is inconceivable that an author with such credentials could be unaware of this.  The Israel-Syria conflict (the US has no conflict - we have placed Syria on the state-sponsors of terrorism list, but our oil companies continue their decades-long activities in Syria. We take Al Qaeda prisoners to Syria from Iraq for interrogation -extraordinary renditions) is over the major waterways underneath the Golan heights - Israel doesn't wish to return them to their lawful owners. You won't find much about these subjects in the book.   Overall: This book is not the whole truth and in places it is downright misleading.  Occasionally the text shows rather a self-important attitude in places, as if US interests reign supreme in all minds, which they do not - 190 other nations who share the planet generally don't give a hoot, except when our wallet opens or we wheel out the missiles.   Such an attitude and fooling around in the middle east for the benefit of a few hundred Israeli settlers, trying to play impartial peace broker, when we are so close to Tel Aviv it is a farce to pretend such, has sadly led to the EU sailing clearly ahead - and they now have a larger army than ours, over 50% of world trade, 40% of the world's wealth, and the dollar is being widely ditched in favour of the Euro. Yes, American supremacy is coming to end, not because of enemies without, but because of this stupidity and attitude within - and its attendant lack of vision. It is also going some way to helping China become the richest nation by 2015 while we expend $ 5 billion credit (plus interest) a month in Iraq.   One reviewer found it was overly critical of Israel and Jews and that the religious attacks upon Muslims and Christians asserted by Assad were the opposite of reality.   These are extraordinary authoritative but misleading remarks from someone who plainly has never lived in Israel and Syria.  It was very widely reported in the media a few months that one religious student spat on the cross in a procession, and ripped the cross from an Archbishop's neck in Jerusalem. The Archbishop said that such spitting occurs about once a month. Is this the `opposite of reality'...?  The acid test for those unsure of the truth in a hail of propaganda surrounding the middle east conflict, is to visit both Syria and Israel - you will rapidly see what is fact and what is fiction. But as you make travel arrangements do not be surprised (as I was before a sojourn of several years in both countries), if you are advised not to visit one of the two countries - we are not to known what is really going on - you may pay taxes but button your lip as to how they're spent.  A look at the smashed and painstakingly looted church in Kuneitra (even the tabernacle and mouldings with icons were chiselled off and taken away for selling on the black market), the graves blown open and robbed, is quite an eye opener, although some will surely attribute this to an evil conspiracy to blame Israeli soldiers. You would have to ask the European forensic team about that, and Ambassador Aitkin. 
 I was dissapointed in the quality of this microphone. The sound effects are very loud and "crumbly" and the microphone itself is a bit cheap.  The microphone does not amplify the voice very loud either.  Cute to look at though 
 This book is the evident that the housing projects in the United States are mere products of the market force that lack inspiration, imagination, and progressive attitude.  People who praise this book for its beautiful photographs only expose the biggest flaw in this book: there is no content.  All the homes in this book are built on false premises of consumerist culture.  There is no attempt to make the houses affordable or challenging the notion of domestic living.  People may have bought the book because they like the drape or the furniture in it, but you will be better off buying yourself a copy of Martha Stewart's "Living" for that purpose.  Don't waste your money on propelling the cycle of our wasteful culture, give that money to the charity and you will sleep better at night 
 Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
 John Irving remains one of my most favorite and respected authors, in spite of, not because of this book.  After reading Garp, Cider House, and a few others, perhaps it is my own lofty expectations for consistent greatness that led to my genuine disengagement with this particular text.   Many of the classic `Irving' traits (sub-plots, interior dialogue, overt sexuality) encompassed the novel but the most important aspect was missing.  Even at the conclusion of the story I could not make myself care for or truly understand Dr. Daruwalla (protagonist).  After 700-something odd pages, (usually an aspect of Irving's style that I appreciate and embrace), I was ready for the novel to end.  And it did, rather expectedly and unceremoniously.  This is not to say that the novel should not be read, it was mildly enjoyable (perhaps because I read the majority of it on the beach), but as for John Irving's potential, it pales in comparison to `his greats'.  Hesitantly recommended for the veteran Irving reader is the best rating I can give this book.  
 This is a disappointing book. There's nothing here but a loosely related collection of trivia. It reads like a long essay which became a short book because the author didn't know when to stop 
 FOREIGNER IS THE WORST OF THE WORST.THEY ARE EVEN MORE WORSE THAN GREEN DAY.EACH AND EVERY SONG AND ALBUM OF THEIR SUCKS.WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU IS THE MOST IDIOTIC SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD.DONT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWER BELOW ME WHO IS AN ALIAS OF WHIRLIGIG FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA.BUY ANY CD FROM ICONS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN,PINK FLOYD,THE ROLLING STONES,QUEEN AND AC/DC INSTEAD. 
 I have been a devoted Hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation.  Although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical, the story is just so silly I found it hard to keep my attention focused.  I compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which I do with my children on occasion.  Sorry, I just couldn't finish it 
 Where is the big storm?  Where is the story?  I'm still waiting.    I'm a 30 somthing married mom and I just did not get this book.    Not even a good summer read.  
 Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new "web 2.0" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir 
 No much information for someone who knows Chinese herbal medicine.  Don't be of much used to someone with no knowledge of Chinese Herb 
 General Smedley Butler wrote a book called "War is a Racket."  He saw first hand how keeping people at each other's throats was good for some businesses and kept the elites in power.  The war on immigrants is also a racket.  Billions of our tax dollars will be spent for a high-tech wall, aerial drones, night goggles, detention centers, motion detectors and all manner of police state accoutrements.   There's a rumor going around that corporate interests are spending a bunch of money to corrupt our politicians and to get policies passed that will enrich them.  I imagine if we could surveil the activities of J. D. Hayworth and Tom Tancredo, we'd see them receiving large amounts of cash and other favors from the companies that will be profiting from the hysteria over immigration. There are plenty of alternatives to "getting tough" on immigrants, like fair trade, reforming NAFTA and the WTO, ending US support for the suppression of labor here and abroad, and compensatory funding for poorer nations; but none of those approaches will bring revenues to the industries our politicians are owned by.  On top of that, some US citizens just seem to get bored if they aren't filled with fear and resentment of poor, brown people. Notice how much attention the Minute Men get, while there are all sorts of unarmed civic groups working on the issues of immigration, like Border Links, which addresses issues of global trade and neoliberal economics, and also understands the history of the border.  In fact, whatever Latin Americans are getting from travelling to the US should be viewed as reparations for the US stealing half of Mexico in 1846.  Ulysses Grant called the US invasion of Mexico "the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation."  Not surprisingly, Hayworth's book doesn't spend anytime on this history. It's amazing how much resentment some US citizens have for people who pick their food, take care of their children, take care of their lawns and do other work while we experience a shrinking domestic labor supply with the retirement of baby-boomers.  Immigrants also enrich our country's culture in so many ways, by practicing the faith and family values our corrupt politicians like to preach about.  Additionally, we have some immigrants taking the risks to provide marijuana to a pot-hungry nation.  Intensifying the war on pot is another aspect of this war on immigrants.  Big Pharma doesn't like any competition for the drugs they sell like zoloft and prozac, so putting immigrants in cages for years on end for smuggling pot will increase their business, and provide more money for our growing prison industry.  In fact, Lehman Brothers and other investment firms have invested a lot in our prison system, and they're going to need bodies in those cages to get a return on their investment; hence, the immigrant scare.    Maybe we should tear down the Statue of Liberty since she advocates all that stuff about "bring me your tired, your poor" and so forth.  This new generation of US natives if very frightened, and wants a big government fortress to protect them, and maybe give them a well-paying job as an ICE agent or detention center guard.  It's all quite pathetic 
 Bay of Blood (Mario Bava, 1971)  It amuses me that Mario Bava himself hated this movie. The first thing I thought after it was over was "man, that was miles better than Black Sunday." It's still not worth rewatching, but if you've steered clear of Bava after watching the borefest that was Black Sunday, this may entice you to at least give him another try.  The plot, what little of it there is, is this; a husband kills his wife in order to get his hands on some land that includes a private lake (the bay of the title). Her daughter stages a suicide, so she can run around uninhibited by family obligations trying to get said bay back with a couple of hired hands with less than pristine motives themselves. A bunch of partying kids happens on the scene completely by accident. Complications ensue.  It's hopelessly entangled in its own plot, despite that plot not being in any way complex. It throws in a good deal of gratuitous violence and not nearly enough gratuitous nudity (but some, at least, courtesy the lovely softcore actress Brigitte Skay), foreshadowing just about every silly slasher film to come. Basically, it's mindless fun. Dario Argento did it far better a few years later with Profondo Rosso; see that instead. * 
 Iles tries to imitate Michael Crichton with bits of Dan Brown's Digital Fortress in this book.  Unfortunately this book does not make it.  The NSA is backing a project called Trinity which is to develop a super quantum computer that is controlled by a brainscan of a human mind.  Two of the individuals involved with the project want it halted and one dies in an apparent stroke which was actually induced by the NSA bad guys (why does the NSA always have to be portrayed as the bad guys in these books?).  David Tennant is the other individual and he gets away by stopping an unstoppable hitman and then persuades his psychiatrist to run with him, even though she thinks he is mentally unstable.  The plot really gets out of hand with Tennant having visions of being Jesus, being portrayed to the Secret Service as the next Oswald and escaping the entire Washington DC police and SWAT units and ultimately getting out the country with a false passport, going to Israel and then persuading the head of the Moussad to help him.  As crazy as it sounds the end is literally unbelievable that would even make a James Bond fan cringe.  The author has written some great tense books (24 Hours, Sleep No More) so I just chalk this one up to an experiment gone awry. 
 How could anyone call DEL HEDGEPATH a success when all he is doing is ripping off poor college kids by renting out delapidated, unlivable houses to people can't afford otherwise. Better research should be done not to martyr a con artist 
 The author had a good idea but executed it poorly.  This book was more about politics than abstaining from purchasing.   Our consumer driven society is not solely Bush's fault.  Get over it lady 
 As far as whisks for non-stick surfaces go, the silicone-encased wires are very flexible--a far cry from the hard, thick plastic whisks with only a few wires.  They are ideal for non-stick surfaces except for one problem.  The silicone is soft and not durable.  After a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer, the silicone gets easily cut.  The silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose.  I have been very careful, but this works out to probably $... each time I used it 
 To sum it up, I'm a huge Shadows fan and if you like some contrived, thrown together bootleg concert footage and road antics then this is your video.  Oh, and don't let me forget the very poor audio quality.  I popped this DVD in after watching Lamb of God's new Killadelphia DVD which set the bar in my opinion for a brilliantly put together metal DVD, which of course didn't help this DVD's rating at all.  Hopefully, Shadows Fall will release the polar opposite of this debacle sometime, we'll see.  
 Why did they not republish the first edition that tasted of strawberries  and cheese. This new version, with it's claims of a "lighter  nuttier" taste, is plain awfu 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 "A Man for All Seasons: A Play in Two Acts" was not my style.  I adore plays, and this era in time, but this play disappointed me, and I'm disappointed that I didn't enjoy it, as I had high hopes.  I looked at the play, as if I were to perform in it, and it did not strike my fancy.  With practically no stage direction, and little direction of emotion, I thought to myself how I would hate to perform it.  I do give credit for it being such a short play, when this time in history was anything but short and sweet.  I do not recommend 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
    Every culture has a story to explain how and why we got here, but this MUST be the correct one. Well, I mean, it's just a flat-out BETTER STORY, RIGHT!?. To those considering reading, keep in mind the very important fact that SOME GUY/GUYS said it came live-and-direct from God - The Head Hancho! (the Dictator, the Boss Man, etc.) This will help give the story more punch.     For people who hate to read, a summary: Humans are scum. Surrender your free will to the Ultimate Other (represented on earth ONLY by certain human others (wtf!)). Someone Else named Jesus will come back and fix everything for us. The Earth is flat and only 6000 years old.  Why must we accept that Jesus died for our sins? It doesn't make any kind of sense, and is a real downer, ain't it! This premise assumes that death is a "bad" thing - Jesus gave up life on Earth to go to God in the paradise of "Heaven". I would be impressed if instead Jesus chopped off his arms and legs, gouged out his eyes, cut out his tongue, etc., etc., and then LIVED for us.  The rest of us wouldn't have a problem with these people if they'd stop trying to take over the world and forcing their way of life on the rest of us. The Inquisiton, witch hunts, cencorship, war on drugs, etc. These people in their hubris think they know what is best for everyone, but many other people know what is actually best for everyone: As long as you aren't depriving anyone else of their right to Do what they want, Do what you want. ----- The above does not represent the views of an atheist. Organized religions as a general rule (not saying all religions or people) assume they have the corner on God, another absurd notion. To hear them tell it, only they have realized the most glorious thing in the universe, and you must go about realizing this in thier way only, not various other ways born of the god-given individual traits of Comparison, Discrimiantion, and Choice born of Free Will.  Let's face it: this religion produces the mother of all inferiority complexes: NO ONE is as good as Jesus!!!!! AND NO ONE EVER COULD BE!!!!!!! HE WAS THE MAN!!!!  The REAL God is playful. Jumps on the bed with the kids. Christians are not. What Christians actually represent in this far-flung future age is the universal force of Preservation, where the 3 universal forces are Creation, Preservation, and Desctruction. The Christians don't create anything new, they only preserve what has already been created thousands of years ago when we were less evolved in every way. Others are busy Creating the new ways of being, and they run up against the Preserving force of Christians and others like 'em. Christians would be perfectly happy with halting completely human evolution and leading the human race into eternal stagnation. And they would think it was right 
 That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If "Sex and the City" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.  Feminism is not about having to use "scary" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever 
 Definitely not the worst "How to SK8" book I've seen but not  that great either 
 This is a novel about a professor who is slightly cuckoo.  This is a story about a man who is filled with opinions that can not only be considered conservative for our time, but did for his time as well. I used this novel to exercise my Nabokov, and is my least favorite novel by the author.  I am glad he wrote others, because this alone would have stolen Nabokov's artistic genius.  The book is written well, but the plot is immensely boring.  I would suggest you NOT bother reading it. 
 Any positive review of  this book is probably by someone trying to sell it to you. 
 The concept of this book was great! Unfortunately the delivery left a lot to be desired. I actually had to force myself to finish the last third of it. All of the magical elements were left exceptionally vague, just a lot of mist and nausea. Now "the Grey" ,a spririt world between worlds, may be a confusing place but it is the authors duty to explain and visually describe in order to pull the reader in, make us understand. The Grey just sounded like a foggy night with a bad burrito in your belly.  The lack of description just continued over into the characters, none of which you'll be pining for at the end. The main character never gave a reason why you should really be rooting for her and care what happens to her personnally.Plus I was just past the middle of the book and thinking, when is the actual plot going to start.  Sorry this wasn't a book for me and I'll pretty much read anything in the fantasy/romance genre 
 How sad it is read such a poorly written and conceived book about such an interesting subject!  This book is a tragic waste of wonderful material.  I hope that another biographer with greater literary skills decides to take  on Armand Hammer 
 One of the cardinal and unwritten rules of travel writing is that the writer should enjoy what he is doing; failing which, atleast attempt to give some insight into what he dislikes.  In this book, Theroux does neither.  Most people in the third world do not see travel as a pastime as they do not have the means to engage in it for leisure. Facilites obviously cannot match those of the first world. Missing these simple points, Theroux comes across as insensitive and snobbish in his remarks. Though there is nothing wrong in pointing something that's lacking, there is no attempt at looking beyond the surface. In many chapters, you feel like asking 'ok, if this is so uncomfortable, why continue? why don't you take the next train home?'. In one ludicrous instance, he even complains about the name of a place!   To his credit though, the author has an immaculate writing style and you can finish the book in no time. Many of his passages describing the scenery are rich fodder for your imagination and you can make photographs in your mind from his descriptions. I just wish he had more openness to go with his undoubted skills 
 I mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would PROTECT my computer from BEING KILLED, but instead, this thing has KILLED my computer FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 4 DAYS, EMITTING AN UN-STOPPABLE(i.e., CAN'T TURN THE FEATURE OFF) SHRIEK ALARM. How do smart, talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear-piercing shriek-alarm that can't be defeated / silenced?  In addition to doing far, far more damage than it can ever prevent, ask yourself -- do you want this un-stoppable ear-piercing shriek alarm going off in your house at 2a.m.? I BOUGHT ONE APC PRODUCT, AND SO FAR, THEY'RE 100% DEFECTIVE AND 100% DELITERIOUS TO THE USE OF MY COMPUTER & IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT'S DELITERIOUS TO MY SLEEP. 
 This book should be left in the class room, unless you want to know the very basic's of a single engine boat's charging system. This book does not even go in to twin engine, boat's with 120 volt genset's,selector swithes for shore power to generator power, or anything more than a two battery system.If you need help rewiring your boat then I suggest you keep lookin 
 I was expecting it to be scary, richly textured and ambient. However, the low budget quality of the film creates many boundaries. Something as simple as the lack of makeup on any of the actors is...distracting. This movie is not compelling and is not scary. The story is predictable. This is not a movie you "think" about after you watch it. I would recommend this only to those who love the genre 
 Deeply disappointing in quality and quantity for this Bryson fan. I order his titles automatically, but would have passed on this had I read the reviews first and realized it was a CARE puff piece  
 It is preposterous that they would even call this thing an oyster knife.  This piece of garbage was literally destroyed after opening one raw oyster.  I could see that was going to happen before I even tried it.  It's just a flimsy thin piece of sheet metal.  Anyone who has shucked raw oysters knows how much torque it takes and how rigid the blade needs to be.  Apparently these guys don't know anything about that.  Shame on "OXO/Good Grips" for calling this thing an oyster knife 
 I gave up on this book halfway into chapter 5. At that point, I had no interest in any of the characters and did not care what might happen to them 
 ...and was left putting the book down every two seconds because I was annoyed by it. It is not marvelously written; in fact, I found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph, if not more (editor, please?). It's an interesting enough plot, but the way it's put forth is mindnumbing. The non-fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways. First, if the information had been summarized in about two pages. And second, if he hadn't pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities.   I'm usually a fast reader, but this book (a quick 415-page paperback read) took me more than a month, just because I had to keep putting it down. If you simply want something to "frighten" you, or are unusually interested with autopsies (there are about five million in the book), and don't care about poor writing, pick this book up 
 If there was something less than a "one star rating" this book would qualify! Just a terrible collection of short stories going nowhere. Very dis-jointed. Very wordy. I kept reading to the end, in hopes of finding some kind of conclusion. The only conclusion found is to share the bad experience, in hopes of saving others from some pain and frustration! I'll never read Peter Straub again! Ugh 
 I'm trying to replace my trusty 12+ year old DeLonghi that got broken accidently. This Oster 6297 is the THIRD attempt at replacing the DeLonghi. Even DeLonghi isn't the same anymore. They are Chinese made junk. This Oster looks great BUT....the thermostat is NOT accurate...cooking a Stouffers Lasagna for 52 min. @ 350 yields a COLD center of Lasagna. The outside of this oven is DANGEROUS hot. The "convection" is useless, it neither saves time nor cooks better, in fact it DRIES out the food. The ergonomics of putting food in and taking food out is dangerous...it's VERY hard to take out the trays with any kind of weight on them without skinning your knuckles on hot glass.  Stay away from this mess 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect 
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 I wanted to like this book - I really did - but it thwarted my attempts every time.  The writing is atrocious, and not a page went by when grammar and spelling mistakes didn't mar the text.  I'd read in earlier reviews on Amazon that such problems existed, but I held out hope that revisions had been made, that the author had finally employed the services of an editor, or that it wouldn't be "that bad".  None of this was the case. The plot was not entirely terrible, but there were long stretches of boredom alternating with implausability that really made me want to stop reading.  For such a short book, it took me a long time to wade through it, as I could typically only stomach one short chapter per sitting.  The only thing that drove me to keep reading was that I was convinced that it couldn't possibly be so awful for the entire duration of the book.  (It was.)  Descriptions were uninspired and redundant, dialogue was ridiculous, characters were just characatures of figures you've already seen in bad Hollywood movies, and the plot, with few exceptions, failed to engage.  Even the setting in the facinating and enchanting Yucatan didn't help, and the author's attempts to include tidbits of Yucatan Anthropology 101 in his dialogue just came off as insipid. I'm sorry this wasn't a better book.  I decided to give it a shot as I was planning a trip to the Yucatan and wanted to believe that this would be something fun to read.   If you value good writing or a good story, don't make the mistake of thinking you'll find either here 
 While the author seems to know a lot about many of the topics he writes about, he, alas, does not know how to write well about them. Therefore, this book is neither of interest to bad guys (crackers) nor to good guys 
 Don't get false hope people! This is not a cure! All this book talks about is Salicylic Acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, Cold Compresses, Retin A, etc STUFF WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT! I followed his directions exactly and I ended up with worse skin than before. I was red, peeling, itchy and still broken out. I have given up on finding a cure, I will probably have acne til the day I die. 
 ...Mr. Jensen and his wife have developed a veritable cottage industry replete with workshops, seminars, presentations, publications, certifications -- if you've got the money then they have something to sell you...and all of it is centered around what is termed "brain-based learning"...but what this book presents is little more than 400 pages of scientifically unsubstantiated claims and recommendations...for example, it claims that the color yellow somehow enhances intellectual performance and, hence, classrooms should be painted yellow...however, he doesn't offer a shred of evidence to back that claim up...it's all just ridiculous...how does this stuff ever make it into print 
 I found this book at a thrift store for 25 cents. I flipped though it and it looked dated, but interesting, so I decided to get it.  As other reviewers mention, it is dated -- but you gotta know that up front when you get it. It's published in 1986, when there were no (well, almost no) home computers. So you have to accept up front that it's talking about organizing papers using more papers -- but that's something we still all got to do occasionally.  So it's a system of notepads, file folders, etc. It does help you try to understand why you want to keep papers, etc, and what you can do about it. However, it does get overly complex, and really doesn't seem applicable in today's world, where there are far fewer "homemakers" who spend time organizing sewing and recipe files, as this book seems to be focused on.  Finally, I have to mention that it was the continual religion-related references that put me off to the book in the end. Others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it, but for me, I felt I was being preached to a bit too much to find it tolerable. Just my personal taste; I'm sure some others will disagree with this judgement, but I have to admit after enough casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text, I gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin 
 This novel by A.E.W. Mason is an epic tale about a young soldier named Harry Feversham. After receiving three white feathers of cowardness from his fellow soldiers, and one from Ethne, Harry sets out to redeem himself. The novel is slow to start, and stays dull throughout his ventures. For being a love story during a time of war, the book is lacking romance and battle. There are so many characters in the book that none of them ever seem to be fully developed; not even Harry. Halfway through the book I found myself wondering who three quarters of the characters were and what their significant role was in the novel. I have read the book twice and I still have no clue why Harry was retrieving the letters from the wall and what their importance was to the story. If you chose this book to read at night to put you to sleep, or really like patriotic British war stories, then by all means, this may be the book for you. As far as I'm concerned, the book was extremely hard to follow, the characters had little depth, and there was no action at all (this is supposed to be a story about a soldier). The novel was extremely predictable, and like most love stories, everything ends happily ever after. After Harry's heroic acts in the desert the three soldiers take their feathers back and this also wins Ethne's heart.   
 This book really wasn't at all what I was expecting, or what the title would lead one to believe. The subtitle, "In Search of Grace O'Malley and Other Legendary Women of the Sea," makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of Grace O'Malley, with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers. Not so. The first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself, and Sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information. I knew almost nothing about Grace O'Malley going into the book, and I know little more than that now. The other women included are discussed in even sparer detail, and most of them aren't even real historical figures, but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. She even talks about Pippi Longstocking! Not what I was expecting at all...  "The Pirate Queen" is actually devoted far more to Sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself. I learned more about Sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study. She describes the inns she stayed at, the weather, the tourists she met, her own childhood, the abundance of "personal bath mats" in northern European hotels... almost everything but Grace O'Malley and her cohorts. In fact, the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from Wilson to Sjoholm; a story which, to be quite honest, I really couldn't care less about. I bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures. It turned out to be a travel memoir, and a comparatively uninteresting one at that.  This is a shame, really. Sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - Grace O'Malley herself, Bessie Millie, Janet Forsyth, Christian Robertson, Eliza Fraser, Isobel Gunn, Betty Mouat, Freydis Eiriksdottir, Skipper Thuridur, Trouser-Beret, Alfhild, the "herring lassies," and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them. She raises more questions than she answers, and I'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information. You may also notice, given the names, that nearly all the women mentioned are northern European in origin. Sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world, such as the famous pirates Anne Bonney and Mary Read who, though from Europe, sailed the Caribbean.  As for Sjoholm's writing style, the book is an easy read, but not a very enjoyable one. Sjoholm's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. For example: "The lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates, walnuts, and chocolate chips. In the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola" (pg. 222). Flowery, gratuitous, and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin, you might say... It's not the worst book I've ever read, but I do wish I'd spent my money on something else. It doesn't deliver what it promises, and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead 
 This book is a great example of the problem with the contemporary left: a paralysis by analysis by academics too comfortable in their lofty ivory tower to actually take any political action. There was a time when left intellectuals were more concerned class struggle than making tenure or getting published in the most trendy post-modern theory journal. Try to imagine the look on the face of any working class Joe sipping beer at a sports bar when confronted with the language this book is couched in. Ivory tower Marxist serve as an "outlet" for revolutionary energy in a capitalist society. The ivory tower radicalism espoused by this book is nothing but another system of control. 
 John Rechy wrote a book that had a pronounced place in my adolescent life, "City of Night," in which he dealt frankly with homosexual male sexuality in the context of cruising and street sex, and I remember it as a vividly erotic piece of work.  It was with high hopes that I approached "The Coming of the Night," in which he follows a number of characters through one day in Los Angeles puncuated by the fearsome Santa Ana winds, which charge and pump up all the players' sexual drives.  First problem:  too many characters developed too thinly.  Second problem:  for a book that deals almost exclusively with sex, it's not very hot.  Third problem:  Rechy attempts to portray the gay world at the moment AIDS explodes unbeknownst to his motley cast of men and, in order to do so, he resorts to the kind of lurid and weary detailing of s&m, gang bangs and porno shoots that was handled much more credibly in the pulp fiction of the 50s and 60s.  It's wonderful that Rechy is still writing and publishing; I would like to see him break some new ground next time around.  Dealing with life post-AIDS would be a fascinating area to see him work with. Only for the fans 
 This book is not about dreams, so if you want to know about dreams, you should get "The Dream Book" instead.  I don't understand this book 
 The first film in this trilogy, Koyaanisqatsi, is a classic.  The second, Powaqatsi, is not as good but still worth watching.   Naqoyaqaatsi, to quote some other reviewers, is just 'a mishmash of computer-treated footage, signifying nothing'... 'all quite forgettable'... except that the feeling of disillusionment and disappointment is hard to forget... The absence of Ron Fricke and his incredible cinematography that mad the other films so great stops this from even being interesting. Don't waste your time.  
 This is a good charger - quick and portable.  But the battery life of the battery SUCKS!  
 I bought this product to use it as a bridging client in an existing belkin wireless network and it failed to pass any data even though it showed connected to the belkin Access point.  According to the Netgear docs this access point can operate as a access point or as a bridging client but what the fail to tell you is that it bridges only in a netgear environment. After spending 20 mins on the phone with Netgear they told me i needed to buy a different model which is non netgear-proprietary or more netgear access points....  How can a company like this be selling proprietary hardware in todays day and age...  Leon McCall 
 This book does two things:  It surveys the history of probability and randomness, and it teaches some insights about how people think about randomness and probabilities.  It is a short, light read, but it disappoints on both fronts.  For history, "Against the Gods" by Peter Bernstein is much better (more detailed and more interesting).  For insights, "Fooled by Randomness" by Taleb is much more insightful.  
 Agee was an outrageous bleeding-heart, a man whose life and work were compromised by posturing, mawkishness and complacency in anguish.  The  gush of his prose--the hemorrhaging of that bleeding heart--is deeply, plangently, cloyingly purple. His endless rhapsodies betray a stubborn adolescence that will delight those who see an artist as a perpetual kid and repel those who don't.  Immense suffusions of tenderness are not the most helpful or respectful way of responding to fellow human beings, and they provoke an obsession with one's own feelings instead of their ostensible object.  In this regard, one notes that Agee's tenderness did not prevent him from engaging in serial adulteries and enforced threesomes, devoting his life to personal fulfillment rather than self-denying altruism, and indulging himself to death by the age of 45.  Of course Agee felt guilty about all this (his writing fairly reeks of a rotting conscience), but he saw his guilt as a reassuring index of purity, like the parishioner who sees confession and absolution as a license to go on sinning.  Moreover, Agee's tenderness was reserved for the disadvantaged.  The obverse of this solicitude was an affected brutality of reference to just about everyone else (except family and friends, his favorite artists and his latest lover).  This tough-talking pose, which has not worn well, assumed a moral superiority that the record does not bear out.  Art and morality are not the same thing, but Agee thought they were, and this confusion permeates his work.  Again and again he makes moral claims upon us which he thinks that his aesthetic project will validate.  It does nothing of the kind: it merely aestheticizes.  Agee did possess extraordinary powers of lyric observation, and a sharp mind when he wanted to use it; but aching sensitivity, metastasizing into ecstatic intoxication, tended to distort his vision, soften his rigor and sentimentalize his voice.  He has his devoted followers, or rather his cultists, but one doubts that his place in the canon is as secure or exalted as they might wish, or as this Library of America volume would suggest 
 I bristle at the suggestion that perhaps Roosevelt knew of the attack but did nothing to stop it, as if a repulsed sneak attack would not have convinced America to go to war.  The conspiracy theory holds that Roosevelt had the carriers shipped out of Pearl, leaving the obsolete battleships to be destroyed in the attack.  The one glaring problem with this theory (actually there are several problems, but I consider this the most compelling) can be summarized in a single word: oil.  A HUGE amount of oil was stored at Pearl, such a huge amount in fact that the carriers and subs would have been out of action probably for an entire year, if the oil had been destroyed.  The value of that oil was tremendous, and Roosevelt would have been absolutely demented to risk it.  It was pure luck that the Japanese did not target it (they actually planned to hit it on the aborted third run).  Additionally, Roosevelt was a former Navy Secretary who referred to the Army as "them" and the Navy as "us".  It is way beyond belief that he would have sacrificed the battleships and their crews, much less the oil.  It's always sooooo simple to monday morning quarterback, a lesson to keep in mind today regarding Iraqi WMD 
 This author is so deep into tittle-tattle that she forgets to write about her subject.  A judicious editing would have helped this dreary bio immensely 
 I have nearly 100 'baby name' books. Lansky's books are among the most shoddily researched. He also employs tactics to beef up his almighty name count such as misspelling names and adding each misspelling as a separate name in its own right and he even sometimes gives these misspellings different meanings from its correctly spelled root name. He also garners more numbers by adding male names to the female side, euphemistically femininizing their meanings to match the switch. I check the accuracy of each book I get with some easily researchable 'benchmark' names (Alexandra, Benjamin, William, etc) and even with these 'gimmies' he has around a 60% accuracy. That's not even counting the names that comprise the majority of his books, tribal-type names, such as from Africa, Native American tribes, and even those from Celtic roots. I wonder, would Webster get away with 60% accuracy? Certainly not and the same standards of accuracy and research should be applied to name books as well. The thing I find redeeming about Lansky's books is that it's full of outrageously spelled oddities, making it perfect for finding a name for your elven wizard in your next Dungeons and Dragons game 
 It may say "Slow Cooker" on the front of the item, but I assure you, it is anything but slow! I was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me!   So, I made my Hungarian Ghoulash in it, glad that the night meal would be done in 8-10 hours when we got back from the beach. All I can say is, thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later, or we wouldn't have had anything but charcoal left, had we left the campsite that day without checking it! It was cooking on low, and it was literally done in a half hour's time. So, keep in mind, if you are camping and you haven't tried using this product yet, it won't take long before your meal is done.   Sadly, my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip- the campground we were at didn't have electricity, hence why I wanted a propane crock pot. 
 This book started really strong and started dying about half way through.  The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable.  About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused.  At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking "What?" Started strong, ended badly.  Too bad too, I really liked Booger 
 I have to say that with the exception of the cupid story the over-all affect of this book brought me down.  Granted it wasn't the 100% sex writing that she's turned into, however it was possibly the exact flip side. All the stories together resulted in a sad book.  
 I tryed to finish it - and thank goodness I didn't buy it - terrible. Don't waste your time.   If you are looking for a good historical romance check out Secrets of a Duchess by Kaitlin O'Riley ,From London With Love by Jenna Petersen and The Lady Lies by Samantha Saxon.   
 You think you are getting something to help assist you in linking yourself with the beyond, but you are in all actuality getting something that reads more like something being explained that the author doesnt really believe instead.  I love Konstatinos' other books, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth 
 During fourth of july vacation, I had a chsance to see an old college friend, who is a vice president for a large computer hard drive firm... he was showing offf his new Toyota hybrid when we began talking about the market forces, which interfered with large companies responding to the emerging needs and changes in the marketplace.  I was fascinated as he explained to me the difficulty of an older company attempting to incorporate new technologies, while maintaining a profit margin necessary to please investors.  It was during this explanation, He recommended "The Inovator's Dilemma".  All I can say is that his verbal synopsis was far m ore interesting than this dry two-hour lecture on CD. I can only surmize that there must be another book by the same name 
 I can do this without the system, it's simple why don't you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups..trust me it works, i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying ANYTHING 
 This seems like a lot of fun, but at the same time most people nowadays are looking for the new cool-looking Adidas or Nike. Plus it probably won't last very long because of the material 
 This is on the overall a good book as the other reviews have testified.  There is one major problem, the author talks very little about risk.  She recommends that you get deeply into debt and use that leverage to make money.  That's ok and many people have made money that way.  Many people have also lost their shirt that well as well.  The book would have been much enhanced is she spent a chapter talking about the risks involved with taking on massive amounts of debt, especially for the small investor - the target audience - who likely doesn't have much to lose.  She should've included several case studies, some that look those who have successfully used leverage (debt), and looked at some who lost everything.  Then she could've analyzed what were the underlying factors and decisions that led to either failure or success.  Instead the author casts debt in an overly positive light, saying almost nothing about the risks involved.  This is all well for her, she began to buy several years before the biggest real estate boom in the history of the country.  But there have been plenty of real estate markets in the past where investors took on too much debt and lost not only their investment properties, but everything else as well.  Any credible book about investing has a responsibility to spend a healthy amount of time discussing risk.  It's like being enthusiastic about a medication but not saying anything about the potential side effects or hazards.  Such an approach is bad medicine, and Ms. Thomas' book is bad teaching because she ignores the subject of debt, and for that reason I took off 3 stars.    Beyond that, it's a very good starter book.  
 Horrible just like Tend Skin. Try Princereigns or Min they actually work and dont burn your face off like Tend Skin or Magic Shav 
 Very slow book, very predictable, oddly written (sometimes I had to reread a sentence a few times just because it sounded so odd). 
 ...that Robinson's latest books have become as pedestrian as this one.  I found the plot uninspiring at best, and completely devoid of surprises.  All in all, one could skip this entry and not miss a thing.  As always, Robinson is a good writer, and he's brought Banks to an interesting -- albeit depressing -- psychological place, but one can't help but feel that he and the series are simply treading water at this point.  If only the entire book were as brilliant and incisive as the very last line.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for the next one 
 this book is a Rip OFF of Peter Lynch's One Up On Wall Stee 
 I want to love this book (I love the title) But - it's about the goofiest thing I've ever read. I read a lot and I realize that I may be considered not "deep" enough to understand what she is saying, but almost every sentence seems to consist of a lot "I am you, you are me, we are invisible, we are nothing, we are everything so we are nothing." Perhaps it would be better if I were familiar with her earlier works and I will probably read them because so many people LOVE this book. But it almost feels like a sham, like the Emperor has no clothes. So on the whole, I admit that I don't get about half of what she's saying - I think a little more background or examples might help. I dunno. I'm not sure if I had a stroke in the desert that I would be comforted by her simply staring at me "in love". (from one of the chapters). I wish I could love it, but I don't - still reading it though 
 Full of gimmicks and silliness. If you are into "gimmick therapy", you might like to call your eating disorder "Ed" and talk to "him" in an empty chair. Not helpful at all, although Ms. Schaefer seems sincere enough. Glad I checked it out of the library instead of buying it. I prefer to be talked to like an adult 
 This dvd looks as if it was copied from a hand held camera at a theater. I will never buy a dvd from this company(Westlake Entertainment Group) again. I lost my receipt or I would demand my money back 
 I first heard Nadia Ali on a few tracks from Global Underground 29 - Sharam/Dubai (which I seriously recommend) which immediately made her my new favorite singer - so I bought this with great expectations, only to be really dissapointed. I can't imagine why she's working with this guy - sorry, he's a hack - these tracks sound like leftovers from Kylie Minogue's trash, and yes, I could do better. Avoid this at all costs & hope Nadia finds somebody with talent to work with ... yawn 
 The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect.  However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry!  It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending.  To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel!  Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS!  It is absolutely unnerving!  This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know.  But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst 
 I think I now know more about the person who wrote this book than I do about Celine.  Buddy, no one cares!    According to Mr. Beauregard, Sony and the entire music media business would crumble and collapse without him.    His "passion" for Celine goes far beyond being a fan and straight into obsession.  I think it would serve Ms. Dion well to post a guard outside her door when this guy is around.  There is some interesting stuff in the book, but it's nothing that's not in any of the other books about Celine Dion.  
 Craig Fuller makes $3 million a year as chief of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. After perusing this tome, it is clear that writing lucid narrative prose is not part of his job description. Of course it is a typical Washington pretense to assume that every thought one has is profound and must be committed to print; after all, they're paying me three mil, so random musings that carom through my brainpan must be insightful!  Alas, as this embarrassing volume shows, this pretense is exactly that -- a pretense. This collection of cliches, shopworn positive thinking bromides, and other half-baked attempts at homey wisdom comes off as nothing but pure wind. Fuller makes no original observations about anything, though he certainly had ample opportunity to do so (Vioxx anyone?).  And so, let us please observe a moment of silence for the trees murdered so senselessly only so Fuller could commit his vacuous brain droppings to print. Indeed, the existence of this book is so tragic, and bodes so poorly for the future of Western civilization, that let us also say a silent prayer for the sacrifices of the ink and glue.  
 The writing was very disjointed in my opinion.  I had to read and re-read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say.  It was a struggle to read. No likeable characters.  I made it to the part where it was introduced that Madeline slept with the ex-husband and current wife.  Give me a break!  I moved on immediately.  Too many good books waiting for me to waste time on this absurd tale 
 The author accuses the victims of being nasty people. This is a very disappointing book. When I finished reading it, I felt even more hurt 
 An interesting topic put in the format that a bright 13 year old could understand. Interesting, as I said, but it speaks of the Theory of Evolution as law, not theory 
 MY DAUGHTER IS TWO AND WE HAVE BOUGHT MOST OF THE "POTTY" BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE IS MY LEAST FAVORITE.  THIS BOOK MAY BE FINE FOR AN OLDER  CHILD WHO IS LEARNING ABOUT HIS OR HER BODY, BUT FOR A TODDLER WHO IS  TOILET TRAINING.  MY CHILD LOST INTEREST IN THIS BOOK ON THE THIRD PAGE.  I  AM A FAN OF THE WHAT TO EXPECT SERIES, AND I HAD HOPED FOR AN EQUALLY GOOD  CHILDREN'S SERIES, BUT SADLY THAT WAS NOT TO BE 
 I didn't make it the whole way through this densely written and intimidating book, but I was absorbed by one aspect: its portrayal of the human interaction between Marx and Engels.   Karl Marx was a psychologically warped semi-genius who continually begged money and favors from his hardworking and enabling friend Friedrich Engels. Sometimes Marx would agree to write articles or essays that he couldn't produce - he manipulated Engels into ghostwriting, and still collected the pay himself.  I also found it interesting that Engels developed his ideas on the class system while he was in England, observing the human experience in industrialized Manchester, which was at that time economically depressed and in a state of social unrest, with a great disparity between the factory owners and workers.  Marx and Engels wrote each other numerous multi-language letters over the years, and _To the Finland Station_ does a nice job tracing this correspondence. It was interesting to learn that spreading their doctrine into Russia was sort of an incidental afterthought, but  I'm afraid I could not bring myself to sift through the intricacies of the development of socialism/communism.     This is a weighty book, and will not be of interest to every reader 
 Even the world's greatest living military historian admits to being "mystified" by the Iraq war in his opening chapter.  The following chapters are more in the Keegan style and provide a solid background on Iraq and its place in the region.  Iraq did not provide the sustained episodes of combat that Mr. Keegan may be used to detailing, and hence his work is brought up significantly short, as there are no great tank or infantry battles for him to cover.  His analysis of the war's aftermath is brief and unsatisfactory, especially when that is where the real war began.  Mr. Keegan wrote about his subject too early in its history and the results leave the reader as equally mystified as the author.  Far more highly recommended would be Yossef Bodansky's "The Secret History of the Iraq War", David Zucchino's "Thunder Run", or "Generation Kill" by Evan Wright.   
 I bought this title, as well as "Upside-down Brilliance.."  I could not find my child's traits in the "RBCIALBW" book because he does not meet the criteria for ADD.    However, when I opened the "Upside-down Brilliance" book, I discovered "him" (and me!) on nearly every page.  This book does include a section on ADD and the right-brained child, but the "RBCIALBW" does not separate the two.  Had I not bought both books, I might not ever have discovered that my child is a VSL (Visual Spatial Learner), which is helping us a lot!    These are two very different books 
 I was looking for a book with advice on how to care for my dog while I'm working, but this was not helpful at all.  It may be more useful for people who own dogs that have separation anxiety.  I would recommend buy Happy Dog by Arden Moore instead 
 Cluttered phraseology, erratic prepositions, dizzying suppositions and a tendency towards compulsive terminologicalism seem to be the hallmark of Derrida's work.  The deconstructionist tact in Specters of Marx has resulted in a collection of nearly incomprehensible thoughts, taking the shape of misguided, a-structural and often unintelligible sentences.  The book does not seem to have a beginning, middle or end, nor does it seem to carry themes from what chapter to the next (except for the repeated allusions to spirits, ghosts, specters, haunts, spuks, etc.). With all of that being said, I know that this is Derrida's point, to deconstruct language from its privileged space that it inhabits, to disassemble text brick by brick and to break apart the philosophical mortar until there is no foundation left to build upon. However, this raises a few flags for me. From where does Derrida derive the authority, or the power to give voice to the deconstructive effort?  Doesn't the process of de-privileging a text require authority from which to speak from?  Does Derrida's elite position as a pol-literati allow him some privileged vantage to see things more clearly than others?  Granting him that he might hold this position (for the purposes of argument) wouldn't it behoove him to make his writings more accessible, to the masses and academia alike?  Considering my relative nascence to Derrida's nonlinearity, and to his verbosity, maybe I am missing the point (in fact I truly believe that I am missing the point).  I will admit however, that the excessive neologisms, the confused waywardness, and the aberrant writing of Derrida may be artistic, and sometimes charming. I have found the reading of Derrida useful in that it helps me understand that writing or other texts may best be understood if they are removed from their privileged pedestal, that writing is just a representation of reality, a simulacra of simulacra which may have no meaning by itself.  But at the same time, I found Specters of Marx frustrating to read.  There were several times in this book where I read a sentence, or a paragraph, or a several pages and had absolutely no idea what it is I just read. If you enjoy postmodern deconstructivist literature then this book is for you; if you prefer to read something that makes some sense, I suggest you stay away 
 I have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile. I took TrimSpa 32 and I think that it did better than this product. I have been taking it for a week, and along with that, I have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch, plus working out. Dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week.  I've noticed NO change.  I am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out.  I'm very hungry before lunch and when I get home I have to take a nap and can't work out until later in the evening. I really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level, which is really unfortunate 
 While I very much enjoyed Cohan's writing style and command of the English language, I found the content disappointing.  This is NOT a book about Mexico -- it's a look into the author's very self-absorbed mind.  I suspect we would have gotten much the same book if he had been dropped in the middle of Cleveland 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 ...but not funny. I don't even know how Cheech and Chong fans could like this movie, because this movie is really different from "Up in Smoke" or their other movies. In "Up in Smoke" there was at least some direction to the movie, but in this movie most of it is composed of lame comedy gimmicks that were entirely not funny unless you are high off your ass or have an I.Q. less than 20. They don't even smoke in this movie! The closest thing they do to drugs is eat some marijuana leaves... how stupid do they think we are? Stay away from this one 
 The cover says "Presence is an intimate look at the development of a new theory about change and learning." If there's a new theory in there, I couldn't find it. The do describe something called the Theory of the U. It would be more accurate to call it a model. And I'm not certain why they think it's news.   They seem to suggest, though the connection is not explained in any detail,  that the U model is an application of Goethean scientific methodology to the decision making process. There are at least some surface similarities. It's a pity they don't actually explore that connection.  What they do instead is tell several feel good group growth stories, one or two stories of personal enlightenment experiences (primarily of the nature mysticism variety), and transcribe a series of uneventful conversations the authors had among themselves.   There's actually a two-way tie for most dissappointing. The discussion of synchronicity was hard to read it was so stereotypical. At least as bad was the oh-so-spooky examples of pre/trans fallacies and primitive magic belief episodes. At one point they actually said that during a particularly moving outdoor oration about presencing a friend in a nearby cabin noted 11 lightening strikes starting east of them and moving around them in a clockwise direction. Of course, we learn, this relates to a tribal eleven directions ceremony.  My apologies to the authors. I think this subject is absolutely critical from both an individual and collective growth perspective. I just think your treatment of it does more harm than good. Do understand, I wish I had the discipline, and the courage, to write a book myself. Perhaps one day I will and you'll have the opportunity to comment upon it as you see fit. 
 I have read many books on WWII from many perspectives and have been to visit the D-Day beaches four times. I cannot visit the American graves in Normandy without being moved. Twice I have had the experience of hearing taps played near Omaha Beach. I have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died. I had high expectations for the book. My problem is that the book never finds its voice. At times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men. I wanted to hear more from this man. Just as he starts to share, the general leaps in and throws off the narrative. Let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different. (A few photos and maps would be nice). If the general needs to talk, give him a separate chapter at the end of the book. We hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels. Their voices could add to the history. I wish the colonel would have spoken for them 
 When I was in college, I appreciated teachers who were especially effective at teaching the subject matter.  They'd take a concept, build on the fundamentals and provide practical applications.  In plain language, easy to understand.  To this day, I value what they taught me.  Other teachers weren't as effective and enduring their courses was an exercise in tolerance.  I found myself saying "WHAT??" much more than "Oh. I get it now".  Therein lies the difference.  This book, unfortunately, falls into the second camp.  I don't like to be critical, but when authors fail to teach, it's best to seek other sources.  If you are a CFA candidate, I encourage you to invest in Schweser, Stalla or Allen Resources material instead.  You'll come away with a much better understanding of foreign exchange fundamentals, international equity and debt investments, and currency risk management.  Anybody want to buy a used book cheap?  
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 If you're looking for a super-accurate detail-oriented definitive authority on duck plumage, you won't find it in "Painting Duck Decoys..."  The 24 color plates within could've been done by any budding high school art student. If not crude, they are at best poor approximations, not terribly useful for anyone concerned with painting decoys realistically.  Perhaps the proportions of the ducks depicted will be of use to some.  But most serious artists will undoubtedly find much more accurate information in books featuring photographs rather than the amateurish paintings in "Painting Duck Decoys...&quot 
 Orginal Cube was pretty good.  This one is an embarrasing waste of time for several reasons: 1.  The computer graphics look like they are from 1990.  Basic looking geometrical shapes floating around don't look scary, they look like deleted scenes from the Lawnmower Man.  One character gets his head cut off by a rectangle-thing, but it looks like you used the eraser in Windows Paint to rub the head off a jpg image. 2.  Boring.  The original cube, although basically filmed in the same room, pulled it off by having different colored rooms, and gave the illusion they were navigating a larger structure.  This one doesn't even bother - every room is the same white, dull room.  There are NO cool deaths like in the original one.  As a matter of fact, absolutely nothing happens in the first 2/3 of the movie except talking. 3.  Horrible, horrible, horrible acting and a equally bad script. This 'movie' seems like a 1990 Sci-Fi original that only airs at 2:30 am. Dont watch this movie.  Reading plot summaries and spoilers makes it sound much cooler than it is 
 While I adore YA novels about queer kids, this one left me a little underwhelmed.  I was just never convinced that Lissa and Kate were real people --- the character development was nil.  I also didn't believe that they actually felt something for one another --- it was kind of like a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, where all of the ingredients for a romantic comedy are there, but there's just no chemistry; it's not convincing.  For a really good read, rely on the old classic Annie On My Mind --- a book which I still practically keep under my pillow, and which convinced my mom (!) that maybe, maybe this lesbian thing was OK 
 not a bad case, but not worth the money.  your pocket works just as well 
 I really wanted to like this game, but there are serious problems with the version that comes in the blue box.  1. The pegs fall out of the vertical board. This is a serious game play issue because you cannot tell where you have fired or scanned. 2. The voice is VERY difficult to understand.  I cannot emphasize this enough...DO NOT buy the version in the blue box. It stinks. I was able to contact Hasbro (not an easy feat because their phone line is CONSTANTLY busy, you have to wait on hold for about ten minutes and their operators hung up on me twice [accidentally I hope] before I got to speak to them), and they sent me an entirely new unit in the green box. BUY the version in the green box; it is great (just don't use it in the elevated mode; keep it flat on the table) 
 Don't let the title fool you as it did me.  For whatever reason, I led myself to believe the whole movie took place on a train in the same fashion Rear Window takes place all within one location.  It doesn't, but part of me wished it had.  As far as the plot goes, two strangers meet on a train.  Guy, a pro tennis star, and Bruno, a psychotic socialite.  He proposes to Guy that they both help each other, with Bruno murdering Guy's cheating wife, and in return Guy killing Bruno's father.  Part of this felt very Throw Mama From the Train to me, but more funny.  Anyway, I have come to expect great things, and high tension from Hitchcock, and sorry to say, he didn't deliver this time around.  The best part of this movie is Robert Walker's portrayal of Bruno, who seems friendly and normal, but just by listening to him talk for more than a couple minutes, you get the feeling he is as far from normal as you can get.  His performance reminded me eerily of Kevin Spacey.  If they were to remake this movie (and as much as I despise remakes, I believe they are planning one), they'd be foolish not to offer it to him.  So for what it's worth, Hitchcock is still the master, but don't let this be your introduction to him if you're new to his body of work, there are many superior choices 
 I'm a huge fan of Kathy Reichs and her Temperance Brennan character, so I was initially excited to see this book.  I couldn't even finish the first chapter!  The dialogue felt forced and the style was totally different (I didn't notice until after I received the book that it wasn't written by Kathy Reichs).  The constant use of the nickname "Bones" was grating and the whole story seemed implausible considering that in all of her novels, this detective's never been mentioned and Tempe's had chemistry with a totally different detective.  After starting to read this book, I realized there was no way I could watch the TV show either (where she's always referred to as Bones).  Ick.  Misfire all around 
 First off, Starship Troopers is one of my top ten books period.  Well done Mister Heinlein.  This book?  In a word--UGH!   The dialogue is laughable at times, noxious at others, and sometimes entertaining enough to keep you reading to see what comes next.  Sometimes what comes next is plausible and exciting and entertaining.  Sometimes it is none of those.  And at one point, it's jaw-droppingly shocking and nauseating:            Main male character, former military officer, is someone you learn to like a lot as you read through the book.  Until you suddenly find out he's bisexual around page 300.  And had a homosexual experience he didn't find unpleasant with a Boy Scout Leader when he was a kid.  Thanks for springing that on us just before the end.    Bottom line:  Do not recommend.  But Starship Troopers--get 2 copies...one to read, one to lend out 
 Yes it does go and come off your head easier than most swim caps, but it doesn't keep your hair dry at all 
 AWFUL. JUST AWFUL. UNLESS YOU GRADUATED FROM EVELYN WOODS SPEED READING CLASS- YOURE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE WRITING AT THE BOTTOM. AND EVEN IF YOU COULD- YOU CANT WATCH THE WRITING AND THE MOVIE TOO. THE PLOT WAS STUPID, THE ACTING WAS BAD, THE CLICHES ARE TIRED. MAYBE IN 1910 THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIT- BUT TODAY ITS AMATEURISH AND JUST NOT GOOD. I DONT LIKE TO KNOCK SOMEONES ART...BUT THIS DOESNT DESERVE TO BE ON FILM 
 Excellent book! Terrible narration by Mandvi. I cannot understand why he did not learn to pronounce the common Indian names in the book,... wasn't that the point of using an South Asian narrator 
 And yes, I do believe it's a big scam.    The sad truth of being human is that everyone feels anger and stress and fear. It's part of life (though first-worlders may do better at avoiding it than some). If back pain were caused by stress,  or even just exacerbated by it, then people in refugee camps, soldiers, and people with serious illnesses like cancer would get it in higher proportion, right? But in all my reading, I've never heard that this is the case.   Doctors don't understand back pain, period. It used to be that they didn't understand stomach ulcers either and therefore also attributed them to stress. In this case also, quite a few patients felt better by adopting a less stressful life or eating bland food. Now we know that ulcers are caused by a bacteria and that this malady completely unaffected by food choice. Yet for years, doctors were convinced that their remedies were effective.  In my opinion, stress is a catch-all "cause" that is applied to many  misunderstood diseases (particularly those common in women, but that's another subject). We all know stress is unpleasant, but does it really cause sickness? Couldn't stress just be an easy answer to a tough question? In the 19th century, temperment was thought to cause TB. And in the 17th century, strange illnesses were attributed to witchcraft. The human mind has trouble saying: I don't know. Doctors have trouble saying: I don't know why you're in pain.  Furthermore, Dr. Sarno offers no justification for leaving his theories untested by scientific method. Even a small double-blind study would be illuminating. It doesn't even have to be double-blind--just a study of some kind would be nice. Someday someone will figure out how the back works, and then Dr. Sarno's going to look like a big dummy. Frankly, I hope I'm around to see that. 
 I had high hopes for this book since it is set in Mississippi and since I was under the impression that it had to do a bit with music from my generation.  However, if I had wanted a book exclusively designed around music, who wrote it, who recorded it, when they did it (both), what category it arguably falls in, and what arguments for and against each and every song from each and every album, and so on, ad nauseum, I would have just bought a book on music history covering the late 60's and early 70's. I know there must be a story somewhere in the 350+ pages, but I don't have the patience to skip the endless blather about songs and singers in between mentions of the plot that reading the whole thing would require.  I wouldn't bother with anything else written by this author 
 I bought this CD thinking I love the song Schism so even if the rest of the CD is just OK it will be worth the money. I was wrong. The CD is just boring. With the exception of Schism the entire CD is forgettable. This was the first Tool CD I have ever bought and it's also the last 
 Got the toaster oven instead of the convection oven twice..

 Sorry to give you the bad news about this DVD set, but...  I love the Kids in The Hall, but found the Complete Season One  dissapointing. I remember some wonderful and very humorus skits in Season One that were not included in this set...such as the crushing the head man with his friend Misha who interupts the play he is putting on. The actors in his play are his fingers. As he goes to crush her head, she sticks her thumb in front of one eye and says "there's no body home", so it appears that her thumb is covering his head... But this skit isn't in here. Why?  As a lover of the head crusher, the only head crushing episodes in Season One are when he crushes business men's heads and runs into a little boy in a suit and asks him "What do you want to be when you grow up?" the little boy responds "A business man!" -- he consquently gets his head crushed. Funny, but not the best or most memorable of the head crusher.   I also was disspointed in Buddy Cole in this DVD set. There were some wonderful Buddy Cole segments in the first season that are not in this set (how about the one when he is in jail and his tin cup is shaped like a champagne glass?), The same for the chicken lady (blind date, attending wedding to the bearded lady, or phone sex line) and cabbage head (I loved it when he invited himself along to join a bunch of women who were trying to have dinner, as he sits in a lawn chair with a sex book and asks questions). I also loved the skit where a woman (played by one of the Kids in drag) sits at an outdoor cafe, is annoyed by a terrible waiter and suffers further aggravation from the "dirty man standing behind the fence" who is trying to bum cigarettes for "his kids" from her. Or, how about the guy that stubbed his toe and doesn't want to go to the doctor because he found the colors of his infected toe "interesting!"  Not one of these hillarious skits or episodes are included in the Season One DVD Collection...Why?  God only knows who compiled the collection of sometimes boring comedy skits in the Season One DVD collection, but I can tell you one thing. There is no way this is a complete collection of the entire Season One episodes. It is incomplete, to say the least. I just gave you many examples of my favorites that are missing. It would have been great to see them again and have them to enjoy for posterity. It was that kind of humor that endeared us all to The Kids In The Hall so much.   The skits included in this collection are probably not the most popular or funny episodes. I would not recommend it. Take it from me...save yourself twenty or thirty bucks.   I have not seen the other DVD collections from the other Kids In The Hall Seasons on DVD as yet. One can only hope that they will be more entertaining than Season One was (or should I say, wasn't)...  P.S. I would not have even rated this DVD set one star, but it was the lowest rating you can give an item. 
 I found this book useless, it's not complete. The only vitamins it shows are A and C, what happened to all the other vitamins that are in food. Also calcium and iron are not the only minerals we need, a nutrition counter it is not! Don't waste your money 
 Total dissapointment. This trilogy is over-rated. Not worth reading if you enjoy true suspense. I was looking forward to reading someone new to me. I'm not sure if I'll attempt another Kay Hooper book or not 
 After reading the 1st book in the series and knowing "whodunit" throughout most of the book, I thought I would give this series another shot.  About 50 pages into the book I knew who the criminal was.  I never finished this series.  However, I have enjoyed other books by Terri Blackstock 
 This is my second book by Moore that I've read.  I have found him to be an alternative thinker.  He writes some great things criticizing the course of modern society however some of his positions on morals are just unthinkable for a former monk.  I agree with the reviewer who questions Moore's advice to the women whose husband was cheating on her.  I've found some good insights while digging through this earthy volume.    
 While I believe that Robert C. Solomon is a wonderful writer and presents the difficult to understand information on Philosophy in an easy to understand way, I do not agree with this book. He does not give any credit to God at all; for example, in the chapter called "Self," Solomon writes, "One answer to the question, 'Who am I?' or 'What is my real, essential self?' is the religious answer; you really are just a soul before God, and all else - your worldly goods and accomplishments, even your physical body and its various pleasures and pains - is insignificant, unimportant." I strongly disagree with this statement. God is more than interested in the "pleasures and pains" of our lives, and for Solomon to think he has the authority to state otherwise is absurd. Hebrews 4:15 says, "For we do not have a high priest [Jesus, God] who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are." If God does not care about our pains; if our sorrow and anguish is "insignificant, unimportant," why, then, did Jesus Christ come to earth and be tempted as we are in order to sympathize with us? He came so that he could be an encouragement to those who are tempted; he came so that we can look to him for comfort, look into his tear filled eyes and listen to him say, "I love you, and we're going to make it, together."  Another example is in chapter eight called "Morality and the Good Life." In the opening questions of the chapter, Solomon brings forth this question, "Many religious commandments, in sexual and food prohibitions, tell us to abstain from the material, or bodily, enjoyments of life. Is it possible to be a religious person and deny yourself none of the pleasures of life? Or if a religion encourages us to make money, buy fancy cars, and live well, is it thereby corrupting its status as a religion?" I strongly disagree with this statement as well! It is rediculous to think that the result of being religious is no pleasure in life!! What about John 10:10 that says, "I came that they [Christians] may have life, and have it abundantly." Doesn't God want us to live a full and pleasureful life? I think so! Of course God does not say for us to "abstain from the material, or bodily, enjoyments of life," but for us to live it abundantly! God does not want us to become greedy and try our whole lives to get money, fancy cars, and the like, but he does want us to live comfortably and live well. He DOES want us to live well! If you are looking into buying this book, for pleasure reading or for teaching a class, I would highly advise you against it, 100%. Find something better and more worthwhile to read, something that states the facts on BOTH sides rather than the opinion of one narrow-minded view 
 If you saw the original Broadway cast of Fosse perform, you would realize how sad this video really is. If you want to see real Fosse choreography, rent or buy one of his movies. 
 I am a HUGE Laymon fan and it pains me to give anything bearing his name one star. But in the midst of all the gaudy sex (which comprises the bulk of the novel), and the tiresome use of "Christ" as a swear on every page, I found I kept asking myself if Laymon had even written this book. This is not one of his better novels in my opinion. It's not scary, it's not creepy, it's just vulgar. The mummy plot was a good one, but there were too many other plots mixed in which watered it down, and by the end of the novel I didn't care anymore. There were new characters being introduced and killed off too far into the book (like chapter 45). All of the sub-plots (if we may call them that) tied together in the end rather messily and, for me, didn't make much sense. I had no idea what any of those people really had to do with the mummy at all. Those extra plots could've been taken out of To Wake the Dead and made into separate novels - that would've been better. I love Richard Laymon's writing, but I had to force myself to finish this book, I hate to say. If you want prime Laymon check out Madman Stan from Cemetery Dance Publications (cemeterydance.com), or, for prime Laymon at a cheaper price check out In the Dark or Blood Games. Anything before this book will do. 
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 I SERIOUSLY wish Amazon.com would let me give this book ZERO stars; the title of my review is NOT an exaggeration.  Ninety percent of the recommended boss strategies are worthless... and that's not the worst part.  You know how it says "All secrets revealed"?  The book doesn't even have a Secrets page--yet the book constantly tells you to refer to it!  There are fifty Scarabs to collect--the book shows the location of forty-six!  This guide was so bad, I actually sent an email to the company; their only response was that the book makes no guarantee about its completeness.    Avoid this book; you'd get more value from burning your cash than buying this guide... and I say that with ALL seriousness 
 I'm already somewhat intuitive, I get the gut feelings, chills, sick feeling when the thing being guessed about is negative, the sense that something is just wrong, or I'll have something come to me that won't make sense but will later on. These things are mentioned in this book, and for that I'm glad, as it will clarify what intuition means in that sense. However I feel the book may lead those less knowledgable of what intuition is and what it feels like and what it's good for to some wrong conclusions. The book goes down the road of new age beliefs rather than practical uses for intuition, the whole "you create your reality" stuff which does not have much to do with intuition. Intuition is that feeling that you "just know," creating your reality is what you focus all your thoughts on all the time and how your life forms around those. Not the same thing! Also it talks a LOT about doing 'readings' and about psychic stuff, leading one to believe that intuition is focused on others and on the far future, and I've found this to not be true at all. Intuition does not have to be premonitions or asking someone a bazillion questions to pull info out of them until they tell you what they want to believe.   Also, the exercises, Exercise 4 claims to be you using your intuition to make answers to a bunch of phrases, such as "a man's name." However, I've found that the list, my answers which I did not give much thought to, were not some random intuitive message, they were in fact many of my favorites. It asks you to choose a color...most people will be tempted to put down their favorite color, not some magical psychic message that has some huge meaning behind it. The book also asks you to take all your very abstract random responses to questions asked in the book and then apply them to a question of yours that is not even remotely related to those random responses you had, and to make up a response that foretells the future for that question. It's just like asking a magic 8 ball a question and getting a response. You know the answer and question don't actually go together.   It is unfortunate that this book is on the market, leading people to wrong ideas about what intuition is, how to use it, and what it can do for you. There are too many new age-y books that rely on quick thoughtless exercises that claim that everything all fits together in the large universe so everything MUST have meaning, however, think of this: if everything had meaning, even the shape of your bowel movement must have meaning, or the sounds your shoes make on the pavement have some magnificient meaning. That's what this book wants you to believe. It has nothing to do with intuition, it is disguised spiritual b.s 
 If you Google for Pacific Research Institute (Sally Pipes is President and CEO) and browse their offerings, you'll see strong evidence that this organization exists to promote conservative ideas and 'debunk' progressive 'myths' about women's issues, the environment, fairness, health care, globalization, drug importation, etc etc.    Here's a blurb from the "About" section of the PRI site: _______________  The mission of the Pacific Research Institute (PRI) is to champion freedom, opportunity, and personal responsibility for all individuals by advancing free-market policy solutions.  Since its founding in 1979, PRI has remained steadfast to the vision of a free and civil society where individuals can achieve their full potential.  Put simply, public policy is too important to be left just to the experts. Individuals are the real decision makers when it comes to their schools, health care, and environment. _______________  So take Sally's book with a boulder-sized grain of salt and find other sources of info about Canada's system to supplement your education on the issue.  I'm sure it's not perfect (Canadian system), but Sally Pipes has a strong idealogical bent (and conservative connections) that call into question her severe condemnation of the Canadian system.  Disclaimer: I have not read the book, but have just heard portions of her lecture at the Commonwealth Club on public radio and was alarmed enough at her horror stories about waiting lists to want to find out more about her background.  Oh, and Google Sally Pipes too!  You'll turn up plenty of conservative links as well as some links that vigorously contest her characterizations of the Canadian system.  Thank goodness for Google and for Amazon comments 
 What a horrendous follow-up to Mayer's previous recordings. With the exception of 2 tunes, this album is as forgetable as "Room for Squares" is memorable. In deliberately rejecting his signature style, Mayer seems to have lost the wit, the hooks, the musical ability, and the charm that characterized his last album.  
 Expecting to learn the truth about the Chechen War from Anna Politkovskaya is like expecting to learn the truth about the Iraq War from Michael Moore. Very biased and propogandic account by a Liberal reporter who has claimed to want to be the "Russian Michael Moore." Anna tries to make excuses for the terrorist acts committed by Chechen Jihadists. Too much has happened since she wrote this book, and there is no sympathy for Wahabbi terrorists who strap suicide belts on brainwashed women and send them into restaurants, subways, concerts, airplanes, and kindergardens. If you want to know the real facts about Chechnya, read a book by an American counter-terrorist expert, Wolves of Islam.  
 This is without a doubt one of the most boring books I have ever read.  You need to take notes to understand it.  It is very disjointed; it feels like a bunch of different chapter articles bound together in book form. It deals with a fascinating subject; it is a pity that it was not better written because it could have been an excelent book.  This may be the fault of the editor rather than the writer; she certainly needed some expert help with making her chapters fit together in a cohesive manner 
 The story of Inanna can only be described as wierd. Yes, we all know that the story is from the Middle East and comes from a time when literature was completely different from how it is today. Although it was fun to sing the songs of the characters within a group in a high school class, the story didn't strike me as a personal favorite. I believe that it is a story not particulary written for high school students as we sometimes get lost in the humorous hints of sexuality and the numerous accounts of repetition. However, the story does contain good story line about a character known as Inanna who is the goddess of love. It enlightens certain decisions that she must make in her journey that will make her a woman. From Enki, her father, giving her all of his "me" because he was so drunk to Inanna's journey in the underworld, the story is rather entertaining if you are attentive.  From my experience of the book, its not a story that I would pull out of a bookshelf and just begin to read. When laid in front of me as an example of a different writing style from the past, I took it what it was and made the most of it.      
 If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series.  This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over.  I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was "That's it?!" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels 
 When I read a fiction story, I don't want to be lectured about the author's hidden agendas. Another reader reviewed this book as complicated. My review is that this book is unimaginative and preachy. I was expecting to read a forensic mystery novel, but I found so little forensic detail that I quickly became bored. The characters were flimsy and the dialog was sometimes, for lack of a better word, silly. I was also unimpressed with the opinions of the main characters in this book. They seemed to share a common thread of condoning homosexuality/lesbianism, abortion and divorce, and not a kind word was said about "the church". As a religious person I took a huge offense to this. I believe every person should do what's right for them and leave everyone else alone, without passing judgement on other people. Maybe I am one of the few who believe this. In any case I would not have mentioned it  but I think there may be some religous people out there who do not believe works of fiction are the handiwork of the devil, and might want to know about the opinions in this book. If you are religious you will not enjoy it. I read the Da Vinci Code and wasn't offended at all- corruption is everywhere and I am sure "the church" is not free from it. But I don't appreciate all Christians being portrayed as judgemental and mean people. I tried to keep reading despite being offended, hoping that if I pressed on I would be rewarded with an exciting story. I read more than just a few chapters and decided to call it quits. I was not impressed with what I did read (maybe I'm just a CSI junkie) but I just couldn't take it anymore. Had I known all of this was in the book I would not have purchased it. (I left it in the trash.) lf you are Christian and decide to buy this book anyway...you were warned. If you are not Christian or easily offended (even if you are difficult to offend), this book was too simple, the dialog too trite, and the characters unbelieveable- in a bad way. If you like good mysteries or forensic mystery novels, steer clear of this one and try your luck with another one 
  By Jackson Griffith, Sacramento News and Review    As a lifelong armchair thanatologist, I typically relish the arrival of any book that delves into the shadowy world of celebrity death, especially if it is the result of stupid human tricks, delving into the occult or, better still, a combination of both. So, it was with mouthwatering glee that I tore into this 278-page trade paperback, subtitled "Rock and Roll Myths, Legends, and Curses," only to realize that its author is no Nick Tosches and that the dead, from Robert Johnson through Kurt Cobain, deserve better than some hack job that's culled from other sources and then stitched together with dull, moralistic writing. While reading the laughable section on backmasking, I nearly tossed this into the loo. When people exit with style, shouldn't their epitaphs read with a little style, too?          
 Its filled with grammatical mistakes that translate into logical fallacies.  It is extremely long winded and repetitive.  The author goes no where with the material.  I recommmend stabbing your eyes out rather than reading it 
 I was very disappointed that the songs on this album were not a comprehensive list of the songs that I saw in the movie. It's a compilation of mediocre songs. Big disappointment 
 This (text)book is difficult to understand -not just because of many typos and grammatical errors. The content summarises the concepts introduced in Goldratts novels. Half the book looks like a reprint of The Goal -and yet Goldratt recommends on more than one occasions to re-read the novel.... I enjoyed the novels, but this book looks more like a marketing gag for Goldratts seminars or the journal he writes, publishes and sells 
 I picture Chomsky in a sunless, cluttered apartment full of scattered yellowing newspapers, surrounded only by walls of his own clippings.  Yes, his recent writing is the result of too little exposure to the real world.  Not everything is a conspiracy theory, and not all facts or events paint an overall trend or picture.  The world is too random for all similar events to be related.  But when you surround yourself with your own highlighted facts of history and dwell on them day after day trying to sell your thoughts, the result is going to be nonsense.  I respect Chomsky's right to say what he thinks, and as a liberal I often find myself agreeing with him (but for vastly different reasons).  What I do not respect are those readers who take his words as gospel, when they are simply the rantings and ravings of someone who has lost touch with how the real world works.  Throwing together a bunch of events across history does not make for a lucid view of how we got to the present and what to do about the current problems.  To me, he is no different from those who have assembled enough disjointed evidence as to convince themselves that 9-11 was perpetrated by the U.S. government.  I am not excusing the actions of any U.S. administration, past or present.  All that I am saying is that the actions of the U.S. 10, 20, even 50 years ago bear little relation to each other or to the present.  And where they do, it is not worth arguing that it is the result of some long-term phenomenon of evil U.S. power.  The world is comprised of random actors interacting constantly, and to say that the U.S. should be able to control or foresee the future is nonsense.  All the U.S. can do is preserve and fight for its own interests, which is all that any state does.   Chomsky's anti-capitalist, anti-globalization, anti-aggression stance is based on an ill-conceived vision of a utopia, one far distanced from the real world in which we live.  In Chomsky's world, it is possible for everyone to get along in a state of equality, and no interests ever conflict.  In the real world, interests do conflict, and equality is impossible without sacrificing absolute welfare.  While I often disagree with the chosen approach to resolving those conflicts, I at least accept that the conflict needed resolution and that doing so presented difficulties beyond the ability of a human mind to conceive.  Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we don't.  But it is only a fool who would take all of the failures and weave together a story of evil intentions.  That Chavez would brandish Chomsky's book while ranting and raving about good and evil on the floor of the U.N. shows just what company Chomsky's theories find for him.  Chomsky's theories could use less lofty language and more grounding on planet earth.  It is no wonder that half of the evidence provided cannot be backed up with verifiable sources 
 It seems many reviews discuss this book through the prism of their politics, as opposed to reviewing it _as a book_.  As a book, I was quite disappointed. Firstly, a good half of the book is taken up with the PRE-war planning on invading Iraq, rehashing material presented (much better) in Woodward's or Clark's books.  When we finally get to the post-invasion planning, the book suffers from a fatal flaw - the author's own axe-grinding. The author was a principal on the multi-agency project, led as I remember out of the State Department, which compiled a long set of guides for how the reconstruction should go. In one of the more notable (but already known) failures, these guides were discarded by the Bush administration, as the authors were viewed as too "soft". OK, fine. However, the author harps on this over and over and over. Over and over, the book reads like this: "So then Bremer made this decision, which turned out wrong. We told you so.".  This is also weakened by the fact that the authors recommendation is virtually _always_ "form a multi-sided commission to study the issue" - not exactly gripping reading. Frankly, I can see why more action-minded minds might have started to ignore the author and his comission - sometimes multi-sided comissions are not the right answer!  The blurb for the book gives the impression that the author was a "True believer" (one of Rice's friends, etc.) who became disullusioned over time. This may be true, but the book is written instead with the advantage of 20/20 hindsight - the author's recommendations were always right, Bremer's/Cheney's always wrong, according to the book. Not only does this strain credulity, but it made this a rather unenlightening read for me - i would have been much more interested in something that discussed how the planning _evolved_, rather than the litany of "we told you so's" that this book presents. 
 Unlike many "die hard" C&W fans reviewing this album who do not like this becasue they want contemporary dorks singing Hank's calssics or they never heard of artists like Beck; I hate this cd for other reasons.  The main one is becasue it blows.  A legend being covered by a star-studded lineup would make you doubt this review but it's true.  I love Petty, Beck, Dylan and others on here and I also love great county music.  Sadly, none of this matters here as the songs are lifeless, awkward, and depressing.  It is a $3 cd at best with no songs worthy of any quality jukebox nor has any redeeming value for completists who want the rare b-side. If you must, download Emmylou's "Alone and Forsaken" as it is the best song of the bunch (and that aint sayin much 
 The write up sounds good, with many options and features, but after closer examination I had to take it back. First thing, it appears that the front DV plug was an after-thought for Panasonic, it's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main AV/S plugs are located. This is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit, retro fitting it in wherever. The tiny "button within a button" toggle switch for fastforward, reverse, etc looks like it's glued on, it won't last long with normal use, and it's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit. The menu interface is difficult to navigate. The remote control is horrible, a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features. You might want to pass on this one, remember the saying "if it sounds too good to be true, it probabily is 
 This was a great toaster, until it starting turning itself on.  After popping up the toast a few minutes later the heating elements will come back on.  KitchenAid has a recall on their proline series with the same problem but there is no recall on this model, YET.  Don't Bu 
 As the mom of a 25-month-old late-talker, I have been searching high and low for information to help my child with his delayed speech.  Sure, this book was entertaining; these kids are indeed fascinating.  But after reading the Einstein Syndrome, it was clear that my boy is not one of the children Sowell is describing. Overall this book left me with more questions than answers on the subject of delayed speech.    If you actually want to do something to help your child, and not just read about other kids who turned out to be super-intelligent engineers, buy "The Late Talker: What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet" by Marilyn C. Agin, M.D., Lisa F. Geng and Malcolm J. Nicholl.  This is a book that gives parents real answers about how to help their speech-delayed children 
 Like the fading in of light.  Would like the sound effects...if they worked!  Out of box the sound effects did not work. Now have to mess with calling the manufacturer to fix or get it replace.  Such a hassle 
 This film is actually directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, the man who co-wrote the magisterial film Andrei Rublev, one of ANDREI TARKOVSKY's greatest films.  It's hard to believe this man went from writing with one of the greatest Russian directors of all time to directing a B-movie with Stallone and Russell, but there you have it.  How depressing.....  
 Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by English Dubb. For ANY of HK movies, ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots though 
 Dear, don't buy this hunk o' junk. I got one over the summer, thinking it'd be really convenient, but it doesn't work as it's supposed to, hence the reason a Cuisinart product has gone way down in price to $15.99. The whole brewing mechanism gets very clogged, and even repeated washings with vinegar don't clean it properly. You end up with unevenly distributed cups of coffee (one cup with 10 oz., the other with about 4-6 maybe)with grounds floating in them. Yecch! Try another brand instead or get a more traditional coffeemaker 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined. 
 I was assigned to read this book for my Christology class. I could hardly finish it because I didn't expect it to be so liberal. Dunn asserts that Jesus wasn't divine, but it was His followers who later came to believe He was divine. The Holy Spirit, for Dunn, is merely the power of God, but not the divine person, one of the Trinity. For me it was enough to doubt the orthodoxy of Dunn's theological convictions. After I finished the book I shared my observations with my NT prof. He said, "Well, I've read another book by Dunn and I think that he is at least a binitarian". I added, "Judging to "Christology In the Making" James Dunn is a unitarian".  If you are an orthodox believer, you have extra money and you want to exercise in apologetics, you can buy this book. You shouldn't be a sophisticated expert in the New Testament in order to find multiple flaws in Dunn's arguments. The interaction with the book will help to shape your Christology but definitely it will not contribute in your orthodoxy.  If you don't have extra money and want to spend what you have wisely buy either "The Lord Jesus Christ" by Larry Hurtado, "The Many Faces of the Christ" by Ben Witherington, or the all-time bestseller "The Christology of the New Testament" by Oscar Cullmann 
 I dropped my Treo enough times to break it, and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case 
 As one who grew up in NYC during this era, I was excited a big Lindsay bio had finally been written. This wasn't the book I was waiting for. Lindsay made some major mistakes, certainly, but there was a lot of good to the man as well--something lost in this right-wing assault. Not surprising given that the author is a onetime aide to Bret Schundler, the arch-conservative Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 This text is an easy read, and you will understand the reactions that are given in the text examples. So why the low rating? Organic chemistry is all about "prediction". And when it comes to teaching you how to predict the outcomes of reactions you've never seen before, it is lacking! You can study this text two hours a day, every day, and unless you have an uncanny ability to understand chemistry (I don't)--you will still not have this most fundamental skill you need to succeed.  Try "Organic Chemistry as a Second Language" and "Organic Chemistry II as a Second Language".  They will have you predicting and understanding Orgo in no time!! This course isn't hard at all- once someone explains it to you properly. David Klein (the author of those two books) does that beautifully 
 With the exception of JAWS and possibly DEEP BLUE SEA, you could take all these shark attack movies and lump them together; just change the actors, sometimes the location, but you end up with the same thing:  poor special effects, so-so acting and some occasional laughs and/or thrills.  This entry like the other two SHARK ATTACK movies is generic fluff, with little novelty or variety to distinguish it.  The cast of Thorsten Kaye (as the studly hero), Nikita Alger (the hot diver) and Daniel Alexander (the studly if obnoxious Steve Irwin clone) gamely tries to breathe life, but this is just another movie in which the shark should have eaten the whole bunch 
 Ethan Walker's "The Mystic Christ" does NOT AT ALL understand or explain the REAL Jesus Christ.  I'll return this literature as soon as I get the chance. It's completely bogus (with very little truth to it)I mean this man totally misunderstands the plan for redemption, what real love is meant by Christ, and any other reality pertaining to Christ.  If you want to understand Christ, TRULLY, then learn about Him from St. Francis of Assisi, St. John of the cross, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Vincent Ferrer, Fr. Reginald Garrigou - Lagrange, Dom Vitalis, Henry Manning, St. Thomas Aquinas, Sister Josepha Menendez,. Etc....These days it's very popular to twist and distort Jesus Christ by saying Lo here is "A" Christ and Lo there is "A" Christ.  This book lacks in real knowledge of Christ.  While some of this litarature has good points (not on Christ of course but on Buddha and Krsna,etc it does) it really only shows the authers lack of understanding Jesus' real plan and reason for His Incarnation.  The book should have been called "The Mystic Life" and NOT "The Mystic Christ".  Totally misleading and insulting toward Christ (Not "THE" or "A" Christ)....  If you want to be mislead then read this book.  If you want to be lead in the correct path then read "The Way Of Divine Love" by Sister Josepha Menendez if you really want to know THE REAL Jesus Christ (There is no Lo here and Lo there and there is no word "THE" and letter "A" in Christ). Do not fall for this sort of Neuro-Linquistic Programming... 
 Begin looking this book over by reading Friedman's Introduction. Like all his books, its theme is rich-man as boogey man, great man as psychiatrically sick man. Friedman is a left wing academic. So are all the authors of the mediocre articles in the book.   The theme is secular progressive. The authors paint the rich man as boogey man, a new stereotypic mirage of America's great Philanthropists. Rich people are easy to stereotype because few Americans know any of them. The authors have academic careers based on reinterpreting great men as cardboard stick figures who merely foul the American terrain.  The weathly philanthropist is just out to get you, out to control your  mind. How do they have so much time for their boating & out of control consumerism? Whether he claims to give to improve lives, reduce suffering, or to give something back to the people, don't you believe it! Friedman & friends want you to know that they really are out to exploit and manipulate us all, after they are old and long gone. The good news is that most American academics are forgotten before they retire.   Never you mind the Ford family denouncement of the Ford Foundation, taken over by extreme neo-marxists (who take over charities and foundations in order to use them to give people--anarchy?) or the complaints of several families discussed in this book who object to secular progressive or neo-marxist take overs of thier great ancestor's philanthropic foundation. But "scholars" like Friedman and company - who really do know what Americans really want and what is best for us all - want you to know that the rich man really is out to get you.  Professor Friedman knows best. The late, great historian Professor Robert H. Bremmner dedicated a career to producing balanced histories of Philanthropists but Friedman and his first sargeant, McGarvie know better than Bremmner and his generation of real historians. Professor Bremmner was a gentleman and scholar and he is still remembered by many. He was not the simpleton Prof Friedman and friends depict him.  Read the reviews of Prof Friedman's first two books, especially "Inventors of the Promised Land". More political and psychoanalytical than historical, the books were roundly rejected as trash.   I wonder if they waited until Scholar Prof Bremmner and  his scholarly students passed away before they dared to publish this book that proves that there is no professional academic history today, just "fiction" disguised as history.   Look for the Friedman & McGarvie students to trash my review. Outstanding students of top historians pounced on Friedman for his many errors and wild interpertations. Now, his jump on anyone who criticises him. 
 I picked up "Wilson's Ghost" after I read "In Retrospect" by McNamera.  The writing style of "Ghost" is different from "Retrospect", that I suspect Blight wrote most of it, leaving McNamera filling in details regarding statistics and the cold war.  The premise of the book can be summed up in one line: "Unilaterism can lead to bloodshed".  Merits must be given to Blight (and McNamera) for predicting the trend towards unilaterism in recent American foreign policy, before 9/11.  The Wilson's ghost scenario is a good starting point to illustrate the downward spiral that we may run into, however, the arguments presented in the book appear a little far-fetched at point (e.g., the "betrayal" of former Eastern Bloc and China).  Perhaps this comes from thinning out the meaning of Wilson's ghost a little too far ... when all you have is a hammer, everything else will start to look like nails.  The Afterword, written in the wake of 9/11, seems all too much like a contrived effort to justify the recent US involvement in the middle-east.  It has a good premise, but the book was too coherent to be effective.  Unlike "In Retrospect", I am not convinced 
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 The breakdance trio are back . this time around they're trying to stop the demolition of a community center. And at the same time solve some personal issues , like kelly's - Lucinda dickey - theater dancing career , ozone's  - adolfo quinines - feelings towards Kelly and turbo's - Michael chambers - love interest .   If the first movie was great and full of amazing breakdancing , cool music and acceptable story , then this sequel is the complete opposite . you get bad acting , bad choreography , bad music and  bad costume design . even ICE T sucked in this film . what a waste of good dancing talents.  But , If you liked the first movie , like me , then you can't resist  buying this sequel. at least you'll see turbo's ceiling dance . the best thing in the film .ozone cheesy roof dancing and kelly's not that bad acting .  Otherwise avoid . 
 Quick confession before I really begin: I have not read the entire book. I actually have about ten pages to go before it is finished, but I'm sure the very ending of the book will be just like the rest of it; bland.  This book is like reading a screenplay for a movie, only a typical screenplay at least gives you an idea of the emotions of the characters. I bought this book hoping for a sort of inside into the mind of Batman, of Rachel or even Alfred. This book delivered nothing.  Whole chunks of dialoged go by where the characters are just simply speaking. There was no, "Bruce winced" or "Rachel's eyes turned stony and her next words were cut sharp..." It was just plain dialoged. The reader was left to fill in the gaps with what the characters were doing, what they looked like while talking in the movie because the author filled us with none of it.  The whole impression I got was that the author was given a screen play and told to write a novel off of it and was not allowed to delve into the characters minds. With the exception of Alfred saving Bruce from the house fire or the journal entries of the main bad guy we are given zero insight into how these characters think, how they move, why they do what they do, or even what they look like.  Take the Scarecrow. I thought the character was intriguing. He had makeup around his eyes in the movie making him seem almost pretty. Some of the shots clearly pointed to this in the film. It was made obvious and I wondered why the actor wished to portray him that way. In the book? Nothing. Just, "Jonathan Crane unfolded his long legs and stretched out." or something. In the entire book, that is what you are given to picture one of the main bad guys.   You have to have watched the movie to get any idea about what the characters are about, and their motives because this book provides none of it. I don't even know why Alfred decided to help Bruce on his quest to develop and become Batman. Well, I do get an idea from it from the movie but from the book... he just does it.   Even Alfred's snarky comments fall far short of funny because there is no comedic pause. There's just a list of dialoged. There is no writing telling the reader what the reactions of the other characters are to even tell you it was a joke.   So here is my summery. If it is floating around somewhere, get the screenplay if you are that interested in the movie. Either this author was too afraid to develop the characters or simply was not allowed to do so. Or better yet, watch the movie again. You will find more depth and less eyestrain in that film then you will in this book. 
 I was so disappointed with this CD.  At least 6 of the songs were recorded from VERY OLD albums....scratches and all!  They were SO bad. I play two of the songs over and over...the only two I liked. When I read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs, I assumed that they meant doubles of the same song....I was wrong. I don't know WHY they had to add the scratchy music..a filler?  I would quickly skip to another song...only to have to "skip" many times! 
 Titon unquestionably knows his subject matter well, and this does come through in the book. Unfortunately, he drains the topic of all the spontaneity and joy that one associates with music with a pendantic and tendetious approach. His writing style, in my experience, aptly reflects his personality. I once took a college class from him when he served as a visiting professor at Carleton College in Minnesota. This book was a mandatory assignment...more royalties for the professor. If you are prepared to take the subject as seriously as Titon takes himself, this book could be for you. Otherwise, there are surely more accessible and informative works to begin a study of this distinctively American musical form 
 I haven't read a ton of books on child development. I have a nine month old. I check Dr. Sears' Baby Book every once in a while. Surprisingly, I felt like this book had very little to teach me. Most of it I had heard before or seemed like it was just common sense. The references at the end of each chapter seemed slightly out of date and far from comprehensive. I only read the beginning as my child is not yet a toddler. Maybe it gets better. But for babies it felt like a waste of money 
 After her mother's mysterious death in India, Gemma Doyle is sent to a boarding school in England. Gemma is troubled by her mother's death and the strange visions that she is receiving. At Spence Academy, she feels like an outsider until her magical powers manifest themselves in the ability to travel to another realm. Things unravel as Gemma has to separate evil from good.  This book is written in as a first-person-present-tense narrative, which makes it very awkward to read. The point of a novel is to tell a story, not to think it. Besides--who thinks in coherent sentences? There are several inconsistencies in the writing tense which should have been caught by the editor.   The characters are at times inconsistent. They seem more like girls of the 21st century than the 19th. The girls can't seem to make up there minds whether to be 'blushing maidens' or not. One minute they are blushing at the mere mention of the word "chastity", and the next they are joking about sex over a bottle of whiskey. The general behavior of the characters would have been more realistic if the setting had been the 20th or 21st century rather than the late Victorian era.   A weak point with this book is the magic itself. The sources are never fully explained, and suddenly finding Gemma flying up a staircase was disorienting. The idea was good, but all explanations were vague and confusing.  The entire novel is inconsistent and sensationalized. I felt as if Ms. Bray had created this novel then thrown in some corsets and etiquette to create a sort of modern, Victorian-Gothic, melodrama. The overall effect is weak and unsatisfying.  
 I am definitely an admirer of Bobbi Brown, whose lovely makeup designs can actually be worn by real women in real life.  Her book "Bobbi Brown Beauty" is one of my favorites.  However, much of the advice in that book is repeated in this one.  There are new features in this book; for instance, a section on makeup for cancer patients and sections on makeup to wear for each decade of your life.  However, about seventy percent of the advice in this book was dealt with in the previous publication.  I would only purchase this book at a bargain price 
 I was disapointed, it was not what I thought it would be.  It's rap and I expected it to be like what was featured in Kill Bill  
 The supplier {digital eyes} told it was available any more & they where going to tell Amazon  to give me cridit for the above item,but I have not heard anything from you ;can we resolve this matter ASAP,Thank You ,To 
 How can I review the movie "Second Chorus" when I have never received it 
 I have a problem with Bakke's idea of "fun."  Fun, by his definition is a free-for-all.  For example, he feels that an organization's "amount of fun" is determined by "the number of individuals allowed to make decisions" (99).  I agree that sharing information "reinforces the feeling of community" (98), but I don't agree with his suggestion that leaders should "ask for as much advice as possible before making a decision" (88).  "Sharing information" and "seeking advice" are two different things.    Bakke misuses the analogy of a child jumping into the arms of a parent by stating that the same is required of leaders to jump into the arms of the subordinate (103).  It is the subordinate who should trust the leader.  In one section of the book, he stresses the importance of "asking for as much advice as possible before making a decision."  But in another section he shares the story of his administrative assistant who "routinely checks with the office accountant to see how her decisions would affect the budget, but no higher approval is necessary" (apparently no other advice is needed as well) (79).  His idea of leadership lacks strength by decentralizing decision-making to others.   In his postscript, Bakke discusses Biblical leadership.  At first glance, what he writes sounds Biblical-"serve the people they lead," and "allow followers to use their talents effectively" (261), but his overall idea of leadership is not Biblical.  For instance, he says, "The Creation story does not assign people, even leaders, the responsibility of `managing' other people" (261)- I wonder what he thought God meant in Genesis 3:16 when He told Eve, "he will be your master."  The Bible doesn't use the word, "manage," but God entrusted leaders to people throughout the Bible-that's why there were judges in the OT.  I don't think the Israelites would've left the wilderness if Moses asked "as many as possible" before making a decision 
 If you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading "She", you will be disappointed by this book. Leo and party travel to Asia to search for Ayesha and experience similar, but somehow tiresome, adventures. Reread "She" instead 
 The unit was 20ft from the receiver, in the same room, in direct view of eachother...Tivo wouldn't connect 
 I have this little (very little) section in my dvd bookcase that houses bad dvd buys.  Currently "The Yards" and "Ghost World" are the only two dvds that are housed on that shelf.  I don't know what to say, except the preview at best buy drove me to buy it on the spot and I was extremely disappointed that night when I watched it.  Slow story, not enough character development.  All I can say is don't let it be a dust collector in your dvd collection, like mine is 
 I read many reviews of this CD that referred to the music as Trip-Hop.  The phrase "Don't believe everything you read" comes to mind immediately.  The music is anything but Trip-Hop.  The second CD is a compliation of re-mixes that makes a faint attempt towards trip-hop, but falls extremely short. If you asked me what the music is like I would tell you that the first CD is "Sweet Music" (a nice female voice accompanied by simple instruments portraying a beautiful day at the local park...almost resembling a sad attempt at pop music.  As a big fan of true trip-hop such as Massive Attack, I was somewhat excited when I began listening to the second CD.  The first track quickly caught my attention and I began to think that my purchase wasn't a total loss.  However, I was quickly dissapointed by the progressive fade of energy as each track drug on.  
 Please do not be put off from reading other John Irving novels because of the negative reviews, including mine, of "Until I Find You." Absolutely check out "The World According to Garp, "A Prayer For Owen Meany, or "Cider House Rules." Irving is masterful at creating unique, quirky, endearing characters. But not in this one. Any likable character in this novel is miniscule and rare. In addition, I am still pondering Irving's eerily light treatment of the overwhelming amount of child abuse his main character Jack has to sustain. Sexual abuse is dished out by practically every girl or woman Jack encounters.  This makes for a depressing book that also seemed to go on far too long. That said, I strongly recommend this author as one of the best at walking the thin line between comedy and tragedy 
 I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't.  The setting and the culture is very exotic but the story itself is very weak and uninteresting.  The characters are all one-dimensional and their motivations are not explored; it is hard to care about them or to feel that you are really a part of their world.  The plot moves very, very slowly and it is easy to get bogged down and bored in the endless narration.  The Arabic names are pretty but are hard to keep straight, especially when very few characters have any defining attributes that will help a reader remember them.  I can't recommend it 
 Hello - My wife and I are big Rachael Ray fans, and since I love to cook she bought this item for me. We thought it was a neat idea, because I had been using 2 cutting boards and this might eliminate the need for both. I used a thick wooden one for most stuff, and a thinner plastic one for raw meats. The plastic one was always hard to wash and store, and if you cook 2 or 3 days in a row was hard to always get in the dishwasher and be available.  When we first started using this it was great, I actually gave away my other 2 cutting boards! Now keep in mind this was a Christmas gift Dec 2006. Today is Jan 30 2007, and the board has "bowed" across the middle. Kind of like someone grabbed each side and bent it up a little, it looks almost warped. Also, a large crack has developed that spans the length of the board. I have taken pictures of this and plan to submit them to the manufacturer to see if they would like to do anything about it.  We never put it in the dishwasher, and didnt treat it any differently than the other wooden cutting board we had for the last 4 years, right now we are very dissapointed with it. I decided to give it 2 stars instead of 1, because the idea is a good one, and for the first month we thought we had a very cool and functional product.  We will update this post when we hear back from the manufacturer.  (Note: We did not purchase this board from Amazon, although I wish we had. They are awesome at making their customers happy, and have great customer service!! 
 I am taking a class at West Viginia State Univesity and it used to be known as West Virginia State College. The class is children's literature and Mr. Roger Samples teaches it and he keeps it interesting the way he teaches the class. The book Madeline I did not like because it reminded me of a military school the way they had to eat and walk in squads every where they went. It also reminded me of an old boarding school where you had those mean teachers hitting the kids with a ruler when they answered a question wrong. I did like the rhyming words and would read this to my class. It tells you that her friends want to be cut up just so they can have a scar just like her. It does not tell they pain she had after the surgery or the painful recovery of rehab. The book makes you believe that having surgery is fun 
 Package missing.  It's never be received.  So I cannot rate it 
 The best essay in this short collection is by Nobel prize winner Robert Solow, who points out the main fault of so called feminist economics: it is tangential stuff. This is obvious in reading the collection of essays which focus more on Institutional Economics (a branch of sociology), rhetoric, and anthropology. Most of the contributors buzz around the issue of the (patriarchal) family and use Gary Becker, another (very undeserving) Nobel prize winner as their whipping boy. But Becker's work on the economics of sleep and such like is also tangential. This slim tome strikes me as an exercise in academic vanity publishing. The inclusion of Donald McCloskey, who got a sex change operation since it was published, reinforces that. Economics has a myriad of failings and short comings but having it colonized by even softer and shallower social "sciences" is not the answer. The contributors devote some space to explaining that their type of work is regard as sciences in most languages, English being the big exception. That seems to be where they are at: kitchen arguments, ignoring facts and solid axioms in favor of doctrine. 
 Italian music from St. Laurent, Quebec Canada? I guess that is what one would expect. Sounds like a bunch of French-Canadian college students trying to audition in a faux-Italian bar. It is pretty bad. I don't know how they get "Gloria" as an Italian favorite. If you want Italian cafe music, don't buy this one. A waste of mone 
 David Marsland's review is right on the money. I couldn't say it better myself so I won't try. : 
 I purchased this book in hopes to have a reference guide for Iptables/Netfilter or even CheckPoint, but was sadly misled. The book covers only theory of how to build a firewall, while sighting no practical examples. It covers protocols, ports, and common types of security threats, but again gives no practical examples of how to write chains, tables or rules to prevent these attacks. If your a newbie to system administration you will learn quite a bit from this book, but if your a system admin such as I am looking for a reference guide THIS IS NOT I 
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 This was one of the few books I just could not get through. Managed about 2/3 and just gave up. At least to the point where I called it quits, the plot was just goofy. 
 This book just drowns in the satire it tries to create.  It takes extremely long just to get to the real plot of the story and throughout that setup it's just the same thing over and over again: Meet a drunk, stupid noble; Befriend him; and buy his dead souls.   If you can get past that, the book becomes a downward spiral of unspired "wit," as people like to call poor commentary on a society 
 Dang, Carl, how could you?  Let me start by saying that CH is one of my favorite writers.  His stories aren't necessarily epic in nature but his dialog & characterizations & writing in general are virtually beyond reproach.  Even though his storylines border on slice-of-life rather than edge-of-your-seat thrillers, Hiaasen's writing is typically so good, his books are still extremely entertaining page-turners.  That said, Native Tongue was quite a letdown for me.  Usually I'll finish a book like this in one or two days.  I struggled for almost two weeks to finish it, putting it down at the drop of a hat.  In his defense, this was one of Hiaasen's earlier efforts.  Everything since Native Tongue has been infinitely better.  If you're new to Hiaasen, don't let this book turn you off.  His other works are definitely worth reading 
 I found this book to be of little enjoyment, I feel it strays to far from the rest of the series and leaves the reader with a dull and vague finality to the series 
 i'm very sorry i bought this book.  It may be concise, and it may be cheaper, but one shouldn't sacrifice spelling for saving a few dollars!  The concise edition drops the dots off many of the letters, thus either misspelling the word or creating letters that don't exist.  i borrowed the full-sized edition and found it to be fine.  Don't waste your money and your sanity on this version 
 Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world 
 I held high hopes for the product - being that I live in a little apartment in NYC, I was looking forward to saving space.  The tune-up stand is little/portable, however it was not too sturdy.  The bike, while on the stand, will not withstand much torque at all.  The bike fell over many times before I gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand.  Forget about turning the crank, the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over.  This stand would be good for LIGHT work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag. Any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike.  Overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person's bike or a bmx.  I used it on a men's road bike size 57. 
 They started so good, with the album "Pocket full of kryptonite" and goes on with this. thats hurt in my har 
 I have had trouble and no satisfaction with this product.  I am downloading Grateful Dead concerts from the internet. I want to turn them into audio or data CDs. Sometimes I get a whole concert as one giant file; I want to cut that into tracks and save it. Sometimes I get a bunch of tracks; I want to combine the songs that "go into" one another (my car stereo inserts a two-second delay between tracks). One of the things I want to do is to save the files (which are mostly MP3s) in the same bit rate and format as the originals, so I loose as little "music" as possible.  The MP3 codec seems to be really buggy. Most of the combinations of bit rates and codec strategies create really wacky files: some go 5/6 normal speed, others are compressed into chopped up shortened versions of the original. When I pick a combination of settings that work, I usually lose a lot of fidelity as compared to the original (even when I'm only combinining four MP3's into one).  Try cutting one MP3 into two, and then recombining the parts into a whole. No matter what I try, there's a little click in the place where the two files are joined. This should be an easy thing, since a lot of very basic editing is cutting and splicing.  The upshot is, buying this was $40 down the drain. I'm going to have to find better software for my purposes 
 Perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug, "aren't I hilarious?" tone of this book. Note: It is entirely possible that I am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book.  Or even to IDENTIFY the humor in the book.  The story of the two families competing with each other - to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar, and donating various organs - was the train wreck of the Holiday tales.  (Although it may have been the story about the preacher, I can't say for sure because I gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely.  So, in fact, perhaps the story is not about a preacher.  I'll never know.  Neither should you.)   I think it's fair to say that the self-satisfied, condescending narrator of these tales simply couldn't bring himself to care about his characters.  They're simply dimensionless, cliched props - the self-centered suburban woman, the socially competitive neighbors - that should immediately journey to Oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which Sedaris has seen fit to deprive them.    Speaking of hearts and brains, this book could use a hefty dose of those, too.  
 Is anyone suprised at this album? I believe that it is a step above the previous ones that he has released, but it is still bad on his behalf. Why might you ask? Diddy's rhyme skills are still pretty bad. Think about it people, when has he actually said a half decent rhyme? Maybe something off of the "No Way Out" album, I'll give him that one. But seriously? So how does he stay relevent in music? He chooses the finest commercialized beats that will have mainstream rap and pop listers in tuned throughout this album. He knows no one listens to rhymes anymore, and many people will move to something with a nice beat. And he gets the okay to the top notch beats from Timbaland, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Just Blaze, as well as himself. Trust me, if he had to rely on his rhymes to get by in his career, he would have been in deep trouble ever since Biggie died.   Now as for the songs themselves, some of them I could listen to, like the "Testimonial (Intro)", he spits a pretty decent rhyme on that song, then it goes down hill from there from here on his behalf. I do dig the hit single "Come To Me". Most of the beats are bangin' throughout this album is why people will like it. "Diddy Rock" is one of those songs I'm describing, despite the corny hook by Timbaland. I like the song "Through The Pain (She Told Me)" with Mario Winans as it holds a nice beat. "Hold Up" shows there is little suspect that he can carry a song by himself. The innovation stops here.   As for the bad, the majority of these tracks I believe shouldn't have seen the light of day. I believe "Last Night" was one of them as he sings with Keisha Cole, thats right he SINGS (...oh and you have to hear what he says at the end of the song). Towards the end of the album, he starts getting pretty bad as he has a lot of songs talking about females causing the lack of subject matter throughout this album. I barely got through the second track "The Future" without hitting the skip button. I believe "Special Feeling" is a joke to everybody that listens to that song. And "Tell Me" with Christina Agulera is unbarable beat wise and with a pathethic hook.   Some of the guests couldn't save this album. Nas and Cee-Lo couldn't revive the dead song "Everything I Love". And Shawnna and Twista doesn't add to the "Diddy Rock" song. Big Boi of Outkast swaps verses with Diddy outshining him on the song "Wanna Move"   So I believe a lot of people got what they expected. A some horrible songs mixed in with some songs with dance beats. Pop listeners and Diddy fans will eat this up. Believe it or not, I admire Diddy for his work and how successful he is, becomming an icon in rap music. I just believe that he shouldn't come stay far as possible from the microphone, seriously. If you're curious to hear this, give it a listen, just know what you're expecting from it.

 This warmer will NOT keep your coffee hot.  Lukewarm is the best you can hope for and that is only when the cup is almost empty.  Don't waste your money on this.  I'm still looking for one like I used to have that actually kept the coffee steaming hot.. 
 Titled Greatest Hits 85-95 ? But their nothing from his 1985 CD "Everybody's Crazy".  Other than that you have all his AC songs that were chart toppers from 1988-1993.  
 courtney made this albulm without the help of kurt cobain or billy corgan and it shows. horrible 
 Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house 
 This is a tale of two rigid and megalomaniac men butting heads. 500 years hasn't changed human nature - that's for sure 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 The Encyclopedia of Trading Strategies is well written and is a good book if you are looking for something very technical and mechanical.  I was disappointed with the book.  I thought it would offer chart set ups or set ups per technical indicators.  Instead, it offered codes, etc for setting up mechanical systems. 
 If Maureen Dowd was a woman I would think she was sexist.  But since she is a cyborg sent to "dowdify" quotes to serve her own purpose, I will just think she is a moron.  Because let's face it.  No one wants to be called sexist 
 Although Robin McKinley's stock heroine of "tall awkward ugly girl who loves horses and hates dresses" has worked well in other of her fairytale retellings*, this one is a distinct disappointment because it seems that that's all there is to Princess Briar-Rose. Even being the central character of the tale, she seems to have little personality other than the above attributes, which are emphasised to make sure the readers know Rosie would make an awful princess. Indeed, none of the characters in this book are particularly memorable, except perhaps Katriona who rescues baby Rosie as a teenage fairy agonising over her inability to do magic.  The plot is little better - events seem random and contrived, and the resolution to the problem of the missing princess is more than predictable by the time the reader reaches the second third of the book. Again, this is a let-down because other of McKinley's fantasy novels are well woven together.  One innovation that I did like about this book was "baby-magic" - a phase of uncontrolled, temperamental magic that fairies go through as toddlers - not relevant to the plot at any point, but an amusing distraction from its mediocrity. Note that fairies in this book aren't little people, but simply humans born with magical ability.  *Beauty, The Outlaws of Sherwood, Deerskin, etc 
 My cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces. However, she can not even use the gift.  You need to buy the Totally Beadifully Jewelry Maker to use this kit.  No where in the online description of this toy on Amazon does it tell you this.  Toy is being returned b/c we don't have the bead maker 
 This book is horrible, plain and simple. It is repetitive, there is no  point to it, and it has almost nothing to do with baseball. Kinsella, a  genius that wrote SHOELESS JOE, let me and you down with this horrible  (should i even say) effort. If you read this book, you are wasting your  time. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it. Maybe Mr. Kinsella will refund  the cover price? I sure hope so 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 I purchased this book after it was recommended to a friend of mine. While reading it I felt as if I had found the cure for my PMS and heavy/painful periods. I ran out and got some Natural Progesterone Cream that was recommended in the book, and started using it. Well all I can say is to proceed with caution. After using it for just a short time, I began to have a re-occurance of my depression symptoms. I have since stopped using the cream and am slowly returning to my normal self. When I did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone I found many people with my same experience. This book is very one sided, and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream. Please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own, or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them. This book has helped many people, I guess. But I'm not one of them 
 I order this item twice and both time the vinyl were curved!!!! I really tought that amazon was better then this.... 
 Lounge Lizard goes off to fight the five greatest lounge acts ever.  Strange journe 
 Damn. There's nothing remarkable about the second item on this DVD; it's your standard European-made sexploitation film. "The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield," on the other hand, is reprehensible. It's a hodge-podge of vacation footage of Mansfield, clips from her movie project, and material entirely unrelated to Mansfield, linked only by the voiceover... and then, after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore buffoonery, the movie cuts to her death, spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large, mostly empty mansion she has left behind.  This movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after Mansfield's death. This is exploitation in its worst form. I found the sudden change in tone, the large volume of non-Mansfield material, and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme. Those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy, or softcore porn to tittilate, go elsewhere; this one is not merely bad, but evil 
 I was intrigued by the idea behind this book but the writing really let me down. It was drawn out and boring. I just didn't care. Chuck Palahniuk would have done a much better job. 
 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
  If you wish to own a book produced with the customary competence of HBS Press, nice paper and all, this book is certainly worth it. If you wish to purchase a book that provides some information about the history of economics then too it is worth it. But if you are looking for what the author pretends this book to be then you would be sorely disappointed.  The key theme of this book is that there is a new field of Complexity Economics, the preserve of the Santa Fe Institute, which is so revolutionary that it would lead mankind to truly, finally understand the Origins of Wealth. Well, in the excitement that that promise held, I actually ended up reading the whole tome. It helped me recall and recollect some tried and true ideas of economics, a refresher course of sorts, but left me with an aweful, disappointing feeling as well.  First, and foremost, the author simply lacks the intellect to cover and comprehend the complexity he is attempting to simplify for us. He can hardly hold the attention of the reader on a single page, on a single theory, let alone do so across conflicting ideas, or across the whole 500 pages. Many of his understandings are so superlous that he misses the essence of some of the key economists of history. His quotes are always unknown and irrelevant ones, and one is left to think why he chose them, not so many more relevant and applicable ones.  Second, the phrase complexity economics may be new but the idea that economics is complex or interdependent or organic is as old as the field itself. Behaviorial economics has already won a Nobel Prize, and investor irrationality two more, which prizes are awarded decades after the original contribution. Even John Keynes had written extensively about investor rationality decades ago.  Third, one is constantly fed the party line of the Santa Fe Institute, which is part pop-culture, part academic, part baloney and part intellectual theft. That the author is a McKinsey advisor does help one commisurate as a reader with the poor effort, after all their hot air is best left for short reports not full books.  Fourth, most importantly, the book takes off the title from Charles Darwin's Origin of Species. Oops. There is no attempt to address why economics is an organic field, or how that theory of complexity about a living system has any relevance whatsoever. Here the book is not even a history book for it is stunningly unfamiliar with the literature on the subject. There is a mention here or there but which leaves one thinking of what he has missed, not what he has covered. The area claimed by complexity economics has been covered by so many fields and so many writers, that even old Nobel laureates like Herbert Simon were hardly revolutionary.  Fifth, the second half of the book just collapses into garbled garbage. There are chapters about finance and the random walk hypothesis, leaving one to wonder what the author is even selling and why. Is the economy so complex as to be a random walk, which the author rejects (explicitly), or is the complexity by design, which too the author rejects (implicitly). Recall the early part of the book where the author says it is by design but there is no designer. OK? and what has that got to do with complexity economics, or behavioral economics or random walk theories.  Sixth, the book is no more than the scrapbook of an overly hyperactive but terribly undertrained mind. Nothing captures this book better than the scene in which top scientists and top economists are brought together (by John Reed of Citibank I think, or else why is he mentioned so much in a book about economics). The author talks the usual mumbo jumbo, even citing scientists ridiculing economists. Well complexity economics rests on all the slippery slopes that traditional economics does. One cannot get out of that conumdrum by living within it.  Seventh, any author that cites John Reed of Citibank has no idea what he is talking about. John was a technologist and an engineer who revolutionized Citibanks back office, and blew it three times. He does not in any sense have any understanding of any financial system, other than as a manager of a company in which his tasks to the end were technological or personnel. Also any author that cites Malthus again and again should be condemned to the same failure as Malthus was. What Edsel was to the auto industry, Malthus (and this author, if he was any good) are to economics.    Finally, no economist can ever escape the limitations of economics without conceding that finance or economics are like medicine (not chemistry) and law (not laws of physics). They are in their nature inherently practical pursuits, not science in any sense. Just like the sideeffects of a particular medicine can never be predicted for every individual, ever, economics can never predict perfectly. Every great economist, including Adam Smith, Von Mises, Keynes and Milton Friedman have been moral philosophers, who wrote books on social, political and philosophical issues in their spare time. Each thus understood how small an area they truly knew. So the hope of the author of leading humanity to some new threshold of revolution is a trumpet that has been sounded since the dawn of economics, and will alas, be trumpeted again and again by the economist turned seer turned consultant turned author.  RANDOM HOUSE WAS RIGHT TO DUMP THE AUTHOR, FOR THE AMAZON RECORDS SHOW IT WAS THE ORIGINAL PUBLISHER WHO ANNOUNCED THE BOOK, ALHOUGH HBS PRESS WALKS ON WATER TOO. WRONG CHOICE THIS TIME THOUGH.      
 This book is about as much fun to read as a book about differential equations.  Good concepts, but the context is very dry and puts me to sleep.  I've been in the industry for several years, and I bought this book as a reference.  But I find myself cringing every time I need to use it 
 This book doesn't explain anything.  It just shows a bunch of formulas and doesn't give any hint about when and how to use them one.  One of the worst textbooks I've encountered in college (and I'm in my last semester).  I wholeheartedly agree with all the negative feedback 
 In high school "Stroke You Up" was the jam, so I went downtown and bought the cassette. Let me tell you something: It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring. Even "Stroke You Up" became unbearable to listen to. No funk, no groove- just lukewarm soul. That was the first *and* the last time I listened to "Changing Faces." The two chicks who made up "Changing Faces" had airy, monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all. Even the album cover looked boring. These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all. Skip this at all costs and get Zhane 
 Liz Hurley has her top off 4 or 5 times; there is incest, lesbian love between sisters-in-law, the main character's husband is having an affair with his brother's girlfriend who really isn't his brother's girlfriend, she really is his girlfriend that was coming along on the boat trip pretending to be his brother's girlfriend so she could meet his wife who happens to be having some psychic connection with a "solved incorrectly" murder from 125 years ago on an island with some Norwegian people. And honest to god the movie is boring. Sean Penn broods, leers, pains, and smokes cigarettes, his wife is played by Catherine McCormack who is like a young Charolette Rampling, very watchable but condemned to a weak role;  Liz Hurley acts very vampy and takes her top off (unforgettable): All this and the movie drags, and drags. Liz stops taking her top off at the 1/3 mark which then forces you to realize how bad the movie is.  The parallel stories just don't come off. Actually it is a one star movie, Liz taking her top off boots it one extra star 
 Pigs at the Trough brings up all kinds of problems that present serious complications to American democracy and to the honest running of the market system - corporate corruption, conflicts of interests, tight connections between business and politicians, the lack of a tie between executive compensation and company performance, the malfeasance of the big four accounting companies.  Unfortunately, rather than analyzing these problems in a serious manner, she has written a harangue, full of name-calling, insults, and anger.  She seems to hope that inciting a listener's outrage will inspire action.  In this sense, she seems to have underestimated her audience - as though she'd lose their attention if she toned down her arguments and delved into the substance.  The audio CD was read in a breathless and sarcastic manner, which quickly became tiresome.       Everyone seems to be evil in her opinion - from politicians to lobbyists to corporate executives to pharmaceutical companies to mutual funds - the big and rich against the rest of us.  The suggested solutions, which take up a small section near the end, focus on what should be done, without little depth on who should take the steps and how this can be made to happen.    The benefit of the book is the bringing to light of issues that affect many Americans but are not often discussed in depth in the general media.  One can hope that someone else will pick up where Huffington started and provide a more sober analysis. 
 ...Mr. Jensen and his wife have developed a veritable cottage industry replete with workshops, seminars, presentations, publications, certifications -- if you've got the money then they have something to sell you...and all of it is centered around what is termed "brain-based learning"...but what this book presents is little more than 400 pages of scientifically unsubstantiated claims and recommendations...for example, it claims that the color yellow somehow enhances intellectual performance and, hence, classrooms should be painted yellow...however, he doesn't offer a shred of evidence to back that claim up...it's all just ridiculous...how does this stuff ever make it into print 
 I purchased this CD for only one song, Una Palabra by Carlos Varela.  It is the very first track.  Come to find it is a shortened version of the original song.  The full version is 2 minutes and 27 seconds.  The version on the soundtrack is 1 minute and 14 seconds.  Why someone would want to cut 73 seconds off such a short but beautiful song is a travesty.  Why it's madness, I tell you...and my soul demands justice!  Luckily I was able to find the full version on the internet, but of course that was $14 later.  All kidding aside, it's not a bad CD entirely...if you're into that Harry Gregson-Williams hooty-tooty crap.  As a matter of fact, I encourage you to get into him.  Just so happens I got a CD for sale if you're interested.  Say...$13.99 
 This book is a great example of the passive exploitation of the college textbook market. Publishers have perfected the art of having an expert slap together material that is not elaborated upon enough for advanced students, or which repackages information that can be obtained cheaply (or freely) elsewhere. Then the publisher can charge a grossly inflated price for the book, encourage professors to require it for students, then keep the price high by forcing scarcity in the marketplace for those same students who are forced to buy a copy at any cost. This particular book will only ever be purchased by college students in communications law, most of whom can get 99.9% of the knowledge herein for FREE. Here's the rub - this book is almost entirely made up of reprints of court case documents, which record the rulings and reasonings of judges. But if you are a college student - that is, a member of the only possible market demographic for this book - then your college probably offers free or inexpensive access to database services (such as LexisNexis or WestLaw) that compile this information for scholars.   In this book, the "author" Zelezny has supplied a brief introduction that is so brief as to be useless. Then each chapter has an introductory page that features a paragraph on the overall topic, followed by a list of one-sentence descriptions of why each of the selected cases is of interest. Then the court documents for each of the cases are simply reproduced (with some omissions that enhance brevity but damage full learning), and only a handful of those cases are supported by any explanatory introductions or conclusions from Zelezny. In short, Zelezny just barely tells you why he's reprinting information that is free elsewhere. Instead of buying this completely extraneous book, the student would be better served by simply learning which cases are considered classics in communications law, then reading the cases (plus their supporting documents to boot) on the computer network offered by the campus that holds the class that requires this book. Guess which one costs less. [~doomsdayer520~] 
 I was given this book as a gift and was eager to exclusively breastfeed my baby.  The first few days after we got home from the hospital, however, things were not working right.  I fed and fed him, yet he never seemed satisfied.  I scoured The Breastfeeding Book for information about low production levels, and basically all it said was that it is rare and not to worry about it--just breastfeed frequestly and your supply will increase.  I did just that, yet my supply never increased.  My baby was so hungry and I was frantic and felt completely inadequate!  This book basically implied that giving your baby any formula is just short of child abuse and breastfeeding is the only option, no matter what.  Thank goodness a lactation consultant finally worked with us, determined that, in fact, my supply was too low for my baby, and recommended I supplement with formula.  My baby was so happy after that, my supply actually increased after I started supplementing, and we are still doing a combination 4 months later.  There is no way we would have stuck with it this long if I had followed the advice of this book and just breastfed.  I give this book one star because, although there is some useful information, it makes moms feel like failures if they can't or don't want to breastfeed for a year or more.  Being a mom is so much more than how you feed your baby 
 It is really not practical, especially when you are cooking on all four burners of your stove since there is only one small hole to put your spoons in.  If you put it on the stove it be careful, because it gets hot by the vent on the oven 
 American presidents, understandably and out of what must be very close to grammatical necessity, have always used the pronoun "We" to speak of American policy. Yet in 2002, Berry said President Bush's use of this "We" was the royal "we" and ran counter to the Declaration of Independence.    Rather than being laughed at, Berry's essay has been anthologized and praised.  It's time to speak the truth: never have inanity and insipidity been so fused in one author to the extent that they are fused in the ridiculous Wendell Berry. 
 After book 4 the series begins to meander around.  Characters are constantly side-tracked into meaningless, boring tasks.  The first 200-300 pages of this book are basically a re-hash of the previous books only excitement (Rand's capture and escape from the "bad witches") seen from different characters perspectives.  This is an example of what writing becomes when the author obviously has no idea of where the story is going, and there obviously is little or no editing.  The author must being paid by the word count and not the content.  The story seems to get written into little boxes, and has to be written back on track again and again.  I no longer have the patience to actually read each page.  I find myself skimming through to find some useful information or a single point of action.  The characters have also stalled out with Rand spending most of his time talking to him-self while the world goes to hell.  His big secret plan to quickly deal with one of the forsaken (started in the previous book) continues to drag on and on and on.....  This series had a good basic story.  Unfortunately you have to wade through crap to try and find it.  I'm beginning to wonder if the series will ever end 
 This book was...interesting. I didn't really think this was a great book, but it's an easy read. Take a day or less to read it. The book itself didn't really strike me as a good. I think this story is more for kids from kindergarten to around 3rd grade [at most]. I got bored with it quickly [I mean, I don't see why people would want to read about ther adventures of a stick with an nut head!]. This is just my opinion though 
 This is NOT a dummies book, in any sense of the word. This book assumes that you have a well-grounded knowledge of programming to begin with and it takes you into the world of asp.net programming from that perspective. While I found that the subject matter was easy to follow, for the most part, some of the issues that I ran into were so frustrating to me that I find myself wanting to put this book in the trash and sign up for a college course. At least there, when you run into a situation that the teacher wants you to learn, you have the teacher there to explain WHAT he is trying to teach you. 
 This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it. If one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality, one will find it -- extracting meaning from each picture, each word, each pause. But, I don't know. I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead.. 
 I found the following on PCRM.org website: "Celebrated Food Network star Emeril Lagasse offers among the worst of the celebrity books. Although he offers a few low-fat salads and vegetable dishes, most of the recipes are loaded with fat and cholesterol. From ham hock wontons to chicken pot pies, these dishes should be off-limits for anyone with a weight problem. 
 This was my first -- and last -- Cat Who book.  I bought it because I needed something to read at the beach, but found it so inane that I went for another swim instead.  Having spent money on the book, I felt obligated to eventually finish it.  I kept wondering when I would discover the plot, but alas, the book ended without one.  I had hoped to read a mystery story, but the only mystery -- the body found on Qwilleran's property -- was never developed.  Another reviewer called this book a pastiche -- a quite appropriate word.   Want to write a book like this?  Here's how...  Take a small town newspaper, cut out stories at random, then stick them together.  Throw in a rather silly single male journalist who spends his days wandering in and out of other people's lives, writing corny sayings and then attributing them to his cat (I thought Koko was supposed to be smart!), eating in restaurants, and traveling between his various properties 
 I normally like her books, but this one was not only hard to read, but mildly offensive.  I have always enjoyed her books because they show women as strong, capably people- this one does not.  And while rape may be appropriate in pirate literature and historically correct, I choose not to read stuff that glorifies it.   In short, even if you normally enjoy her works, leave this one on the shelf 
 ... which makes the wrench completely useless.  I'll have to buy another wrench elsewhere from a vendor that supplies the bits.  Also, the wooden handles have splinters and are extremely cheaply made.  Do not buy this product 
 If you want to keep your sanity you will not buy this toy! I read the reviews before I bought this for my son and should have taken them to heart! He wanted it so badly. I could have used the $ for this on other things!This is so hard to but back together once you get it open. It's so frustrating. I didn't realize that it had so many little parts to put together and keep track of once opened. It is very loud and not sure what the sound is supposed to be. I think a subway train. It doesn't come with a batman so all the 6 batman that we have do not fit..My 51/2 year old was very disapointed and he gets so frustrated when playing with this 
 Do not buy this book unless you are being retested on the old PMP or CAPM exam.   This book is based on the 2nd edition (2000) of the PMBOK and is therefore obsolete.  The current exams use the 3rd edition (2004) of the PMBOK.  Much has changed so this book will mislead you and you will answer exams questions incorrectly.  The processes, process groups, some definition have changed.  As a result, many of his test questions will be wrong also. I am a PMP and I teach PMP and CAPM test prep sessions 
 Interesting ideas but the author spends too much time on details. The style is inconsistent and the ideas are not well developped. It's indeed a book for beginners but no secrets will be revealed here. The author spent three or four chapters criticizing over and over again christianity......who cares? Why not focusing on the main topic ?   In general, I have the impression the book was quickly made with the main intention to promote "pacts with the devil" (written by the same authors).  If you intend to do reseaches on voodoo, books like "the sacred arts of haitian vodou" by donald j. cosentino can be a good start to realize how art is important in this magical system and may be "secrets of voodoo" by Milo Rigaud 
  ---VERY IMPORTANT----The software supplied converts your mp3/wma files to an alltrac format only usable on your computer and your sony netmd!!! (I think they do this for copyright purposes, but what if your mp3 files are ones you recorded in a studio yourself?!?!?)  I do not recommend this product as the software railroads you into buying from their site(connect.com) in alltrac format, which is the only format the netmd players play!!! Thats right, it does NOT play mp3. It does NOT play wma files. It only plays files converted into alltrac form! 
 So lets see if this makes sense:  -Mormons are forcibly expelled by Missouri Militia (Gov. Boggs infamous "Extermination Order") in 1838; -They are again expelled by Illinois Militia in 1846 after Joseph Smith is murdered in State custody; -They flee to the desert wastes of the Great Basin where no one else wants to settle--they struggle against starvation to survive; -Republican John C. Fremont (notable for killing Indian women/children with his sabre to save gunpowder) runs for President in 1856 on a platform to abolish "the twin relics of barbarism", namely slavery and polygamy; -Southern Democrat James Buchanan is elected President in 1856--he won't do anything about slavery; -But Buchanan pre-empts the Republican's religious bigotry platform by acting on bogus reports of a "Mormon Rebellion" to send the "Utah Expedition" to "quell" the insurrection; -Utah Territorial Governor Brigham Young--fearing (with just cause) the worst--orders what turns out to be a bloodless defense by Mormon Raiders, who force Johnston's Army to winter in Ft. Bridger, Wyoming; -This delay permits cooler heads in Washington/Salt Lake City to avoid open war in 1858; -This in the context that newspapers in California and elsewhere had long advocated a "final solution" to the "Mormon Problem"; better to kill them than to tolerate them; -Since the Mormons had been driven from state to state because of religious intolerance, why would they have reason to trust the good graces of Pres. Buchanan and a beligerent/hostile Federal Army marching on Utah?    Author Will Bagley briefly mentions most of the above historical facts and acknowledges that Gov. Young had "virtually no military or political weapons to resist federal authority...".  But his entire book is spent minimalizing the ordeals of the Mormons--even insinuating they deserved to be driven--in order to slander Gov. Young with a supposed "crime of power".  In a nutshell, Bagley picks up the prosecutor's mantle of Cradlebaugh, Carlton and Baskin in their rigorous but dead-end attempts to "Pin the Tale on Brigham".  Those bigots couldn't produce evidence to indict Brigham Young then despite the full power and funding of the U.S. Government/Army behind them, and Bagley certainly fails to produce evidence to indict Brigham Young now.    For example, Bagley's "smoking gun"--the journal of Dimick Huntington--speaks vaguely of Gov. Young's "giving" the cattle of emigrants on the road south to the Piutes, but fails to mention that none of the Indians present at that event were anywhere near Mountain Meadows until after the atrocity was consumated.  The Piutes who did participate knew nothing of this purported deal.  You'd expect such sham evidence from the likes of Barney Fife, not a serious or unbiased historian.     Further, Bagley presumes to channel Gov. Young's thoughts regarding the Mormon's September, 1857 "war strategy" against the hostile U.S. Government/Army.  Bagley speculates that Gov. Young ordered the massacre of the Fancher train to in some way intimidate the U.S. Government by closing the overland trails and "violating" his oath of office.  This is utterly preposterous--especially in the context of a hostile Army marching on Utah.  Obviously, Bagley believes Gov. Young to be either exceptionally stupid/obtuse or perhaps "Jim Jones" suicidal to deliberately give Pres. Buchanan and the Army the very pretext/incident they needed to justify the elimination of the "Mormon Problem" once and for all.  Bagley acknowledges that Gov. Young was a "fox"--a very shrewd operator--another Bagley contradiction.  If Bagley is so biased to believe such tortured logic, perhaps he also can conjure the tunnel-vision necessary to believe in the tooth fairy.        Bagley's research for the most part is detailed--if not tedious--though he should better acknowledge the tabloid nature of most of his sources.  He often quotes tabloid rather than primary sources.  His prose is pointedly inflamatory against Brigham Young and the Mormons; they are "fanatics" who are "oblivious" to the rancor the practice of their religion has on non-Mormons--as if this is license/justification to send mobs/militias/Armies to persecute, prosecute, and drive an entire religious movement.  Hasn't Bagley heard of the First Amendment?  Pres. Buchanan sure acted like he didn't...  Bagley's conclusions and analysis are preposterous--particularly the tortured parsing of Gov. Young's straight-forward order to Haight/Iron County to leave the wagon train alone.  ("Depends on what the meaning of 'is' is", right, Mr. Bagley?)    Bagley's caricature of Mormon society as not being capable of doing anything with or without direction from Brigham Young is also groteque, insulting and utterly false.  I defy anyone anywhere to show where in the Book of Mormon the Indians are referred to  as the "Battle-axe Of The Lord".  Bagley works all the tired Mormon sterotypes possible to rationalize his bias.  Bagley insists he uses logic to put together the puzzle of Mountain Meadows.  He sez Gov. Young/Apostle Smith contributed to the tinderbox creating the conditions for the Massacre.  In the context of looming war, I agree because Young/Smith had every reason to believe they were about to be attacked/driven/exterminated by the US Army.  While trying to pin contextual blame on Young/Smith, Bagley brazenly fails to acknowledge the "elephant in the tent": Pres. Buchanan and the US Army.  This Massacre would absolutely not have happened had it not been for the bigoted and reckless warmongering by Pres. Buchanan to send the Army to Utah, regardless of the murder of Parley P. Pratt.  If Bagley wants to apportion blame on Young/Smith and is so insistant on an apology/repentance of the contemporary LDS Church, why doesn't he also demand the same of Pres. Buchanan's successors, the U.S. Army, and the descendents of the corrupt Federal appointees who clearly harrassed the Saints?  If he is so convinced of the benign behavior of the Fancher party who stampeded Utah with their very large (and presumably hungry) cattle herd (remember Utah is a desert with little grass, unlike Arkansas), why can't he give a scintilla of benefit-of-the-doubt to Gov. Young and the Mormons?  Clearly, Bagley is pandering to those Mormon haters whose mind is already made up and can't be confused with fact.  The bottom line is this: Southern Utah Mormons got caught up in the war hysteria caused by the outrageously unwarranted march of the US Army, feared that once again they as a people would be driven, over-reacted to an emigrant party that was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and commited a horrible atrocity.  Much to the chagrin of the Mormon haters, the act was local.  Perhaps for Bagley's sake, Mark Hoffman can "discover" a document that could really indict Gov. Young...    As the great-nephew of Juanita Brooks, Bagley's presuming to carry on the truthful inquiry she initiated is a farce.  Brooks did not have an axe to grind, as Bagley obviously does.  Perhaps Bagley would do better to try his hand at writing comic books.   
 This is, without a doubt, the worst investment I have made so far.  The grammar and punctuation is deplorable, and the information is next to useless.  There are infinitely better sources for anyone looking for information on how to start a small business.  I would have given it a rating of less than one star had one been available.  Save your time and money 
 The volume control on this is totally lame.  I can't get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime.  Also, the sound quality is poor in general.  I suppose it's OK for just playing in the room, but definitely not for bed.  You can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price 
 This title is the bootleg title for a film called the The Ratings Game. I'm no sure why Amazon is selling this on their web site. The quality of this DVD is terrible, I was suspicious when I got it. The DVD case and the DVD itself look like they were home made. Having said all this, knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it. It's like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time. I expected more of Danny DeVito.  
 I was happy come across a book by Chatwin and another title that seemed to make sense to me. But - disapointment followed. This book is full of name dropping and references so obscure to a time and age that is really only talking to the gilded ex-pats of yore that were sitting in their chestnut studies in the colonised counties and it doesn;t go much beyond that. I think the basis for better is there in, say, the chapter "the Morality of Things" but published as it is, it is still unformed. The same goes for the Nomad chapters. Basically, these works were left unpublished for a reason. They should have stayed that way. Bruce has died and we should just appreciate his words from his own hand. I suggest you stick with the real Bruce 
 If you ever read this book: Joe Sack' SQL server 2000 Fast Answers for DBA and Developer, then you will see Vieira's book misses so many details about SQL server 2000. Understanding that this book focuses on PROGRAMMING only, but still it misses many PROGRAMMING  DETAILS of SQL server 2000. I do not have no connection to Joe Sack's business. I read and compare the two and speak out my mind. 
 First off I like Bolton's early work in the late 70's to mid 80's.Bolton's first albums Blackjack 1979, Worlds Apart 1980, Michael Bolton 1983, and Everybody's Crazy 1985 were all pretty good melodic rockers, but this is the end.Soul provider is the beginning of a soul failure. The only good songs on here are How can we be Lovers and You wouldn't know Love.These songs have a catchy chorus and rock somewhat.The rest of the album is garbage. Why did you sell out Bolton? It's such a shame what could of been.If Bolton stayed on the melodic metal/rock path he would be a rocker still to this day and most likely a dam good one like he was in the early to mid 80's. It's a cryin shame 
 I have the VHS tape of this movie, I really like it. I decided to buy the DVD version for better image quality and some bonus features. But I found that the image quality is not better than VHS version. And there is absolutely no single bonus feature. You can only choose, "play main feature". Even worse, it does not even have any caption or subtitle. At least the VHS had closed caption. This DVD is sort of "just watch once and throw it to the garbage can" quality. If so, why don't you buy a better featured VHS  
 While there is much in this book that is creative and imaginative, all that for me was undermined by the fact that, when I closed the book, I had concluded that its author, though a woman herself, must be a misogynist.  There are two female characters whose narrative significance is comparable to that of the narrator himself, Doug, and Harry, the protagonist.  One is the teacher, who is presented very positively, but who is not a character the primary school readers of this book will specifically identify with.  The other is Doug and Harry's classmate Mary, and by the time I finished the book, I despised her.  She is assertive, but her assertiveness is distorted and made ugly, so that when she gets her come-uppance, as she does several times (e.g. when her overpriced cookies at the bake sale don't sell), the reader can't help feeling glad.  Harry is nicer and more clever, and gets the better of her every time.  Her one good moment in the book is when she conceives the idea of the bake sale, and of calling it a moon sale, and the teacher praises her.  Other than that she is obnoxious and arrogant.  Primary school readers are not likely to notice these things consciously, but the subliminal message is there: boys are smarter and more fun, girls should sit down and shut up, or leave it at coming up with clever ideas for bake sales, or at least just go along with the boys, as Song Lee does.  Compare this to the Jigsaw Jones series, where Jigsaw Jones's detective partner Mila "demands equal pay for equal work," and that is "worth every penny" to Jigsaw (Jigsaw Jones and the Case of the Missing Hamster, by James Preller--note that this author is a man, and he does a better job with gender equity).  I would not foist Horrible Harry Goes to the Moon on either girls (who are demeaned by it) OR boys, who don't need its message any more than the girls do 
 When this product came, it says "girls" - not a woman's size.  I'm a petite woman 5'2 105lbs and the medium was too tight for me - like a jr's size or "girls" size as the tag states.  Now I have to spend $$ sending this product back 
 Oh my goodness.  What a horrible book.  Not only is full of anachronisms, a significant part of it is copied right out of the Bible.  If you are Mormon, it is your "Mein Kampf", you gotta have it.  If you are not Mormon, you might want to have it as a conversation piece about cults.    Laughably ridiculous!!  I would have given it negative stars if possible, but the minimum ws one star 
 Thomas Sowell continues his simpleminded interpretations. His so-called refutations have not changed. He is a clown. He learned obviously at an early age how to make money by proclaiming he is not Black.And he is right! He is not! 
   I'm very surprised that this product has as high a rating as it does, I suppose most are simply glad the show is available on DVD.  However, the transfer to DVD is absolutely horrible.  On an opening night shot on disc 1, there is so much junk on the film that one would think one was seeing lightning bugs -- inside the house!  The colors on these prints aren't even as good as what is shown on TVLand.  This show might be 30 years old, but they cannot be using the best prints available.  There is another irritating tip-off of the cheapness of this package -- the music on the closing credits is wrong -- or is this my imagination?     For those who are defending this package, the upcoming Daniel Boone DVD set is a good item to compare it with.  That show aired in 1966 and the remastered print is fantastic.  Studios and re-issue companies can do a good job when they choose to.  It's a real shame that, in this age of big-screen TVs, this program will look so shoddy.  It's apparent that with such a popular show, they could have recouped the investment 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks  
 I am always up for a change and a chance offering. When I heard that the "twins" were compared to Siouxsie and the Banshees, well I thought it deserved a hear-see. This is echo chamber crud. Voices that are incoherent and music that sounds as if play in a trash can (appropriate place to place this CD) Sorry, Siouxsie could expell better music and sounds through their intestinals track better than this. 
 I was a big, big fan of the original RiftWar series and the Empire series co-authored with Janny Wurts, so I thought I'd check out what Feist had written recently. I now wish I hadn't. To be blunt, I was disgusted by this book and couldn't finish it. The writing is good enough, but the whole atmosphere is nasty.   The whole book reads like a long S&M fantasy. Talon is a hopeless character who is constantly used and bullied by the people around him, the supposed "good people" in the world. He doesn't stand up to them, rather he seems to think it is his place to be put down and humiliated.  I was particularly revolted to see Pug, a character I had grown quite fond of in previous books, acting so cruel and callous.    I do not recommend this book to anyone 
 That part alone was not a redeeming factor for the film. I'm not going to even get into the fact that the actors performances were dull to say the least, or that the plot from beginning to end was lackluster. I actually wasted $3.99 renting this schlock on ON DEMAND. Boy, do I want my 4 bucks back. Basically, all this movie was about was five crackheads running around playing crackhead games. If I wanted to see that, I could have saved my money and walked around the corner. Furthermore, I could have got a camcorder and made a movie about a bunch of fiends sitting around the house babbling about nonsense for two hours!! Would have saved millions. To sum up, I would like to advise folks to please avoid this as if it was the Ebola virus!! 
 Someone just today told me I should see this film.  What a disappointment to see these warnings of poor quality DVDs being produced by Fox Lorber.  Oh well 
 THE ONLY REASON I EVER ORDERED THESE PANS IS BECAUSE THEY COME WITH THE LIDS.. !!.. Pans this size are hard to find lids for & for the PRICE aren't WORTH it without LIDS... This pan as decribed is to come with LIDS. But I've ordered them twice 4 pans in all & still no LIDS.. So I'm requesting a Refund this time.. I have purchased many of these pans from this company & they are very nice . Well worth the Price.. TOO BAD THIS PAGE IS MISLEADING.. I'm Ready when they get LIDS!! Reason for only two stars is NO LIDS... The Pan Rocks. 
 I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.  I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.  
 Since I don't normally write reviews, I'll not try to make this clever.  I was completely disappointed in this latest attempt from Vince Flynn.  Though I love the character of Mitch Rapp, in this novel he read like a cardboard cut-out of the Mitch Rapp in all previous books.  As I read, I tried to analyze what was going on: "Well, he just been through a big loss, very traumatic...Flynn is trying to show the audience that Mitch has been profoundly altered by the experience.  Flynn will deal with this head on at some point in the novel".  He never does.  The whole interaction between Kennedy and Rapp at the end of the book feels like it was written by an 7th grader - its out of character and unbelievable for two seasoned intelligence professionals, completely without subtlety.  I've now come to the conclusion that, as a writer, Flynn has lost the hunger (i.e. is too full of himself, now that he's "made it" and has friends in high places).  My husband is a writer, I know the difference between when he's producing junk and when he's in the creative zone, writer coming together with words, not satisied until he's melded creative energy to insight, to produce art.   It appears that Flynn hurried threw this together -- a great disappointment to his fans who have followed Mitch since Term Limits and connected with his ability to read a situation, act decisively and remain in control, objectives intact.  I've already sold this book (though I won't part with the others) and I'll be more careful before I buy Flynn's next offering. My advice to Vince: Remember why you started writing (I'll bet it wasn't to produce books of mediocity).  
 I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.  There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.  I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.  The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.  I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve 
 This book was...interesting. I didn't really think this was a great book, but it's an easy read. Take a day or less to read it. The book itself didn't really strike me as a good. I think this story is more for kids from kindergarten to around 3rd grade [at most]. I got bored with it quickly [I mean, I don't see why people would want to read about ther adventures of a stick with an nut head!]. This is just my opinion though 
 These breast pads are sooooo different from the Johnson & Johnson product.  They don't absorb your milk, which means it still gets all over your clothes.  The don't have adhesive, which means the pads move all over the place.  Generally, just a waste of money.  You might as well use toilet tissue :).

 What we should be doing, is doing evangelism the way the Bible tells us to do it.  So many "christians" tell us how to share your faith in a non-offensive way.  Is that what Jesus Christ did?  If I remember correctly, evil, unrighteous men tried to kill Jesus 10x before they actually put Him on the cross.  Why would they want to hurt such a soft, loving, smiling man?  Because Jesus said the world hates Him "because I testify of it, that the works of it are evil." (John 7:7)  That's why.  No one is going to be soundly saved unless they are brought under a conviction of sin.  We are to warn this world about the judgment of God, the very reason men are commanded to repent (Acts 17:30,31).  We are to use the Law of God to bring the knowledge of sin (Romans 3:20).  We need to make people see their sin as "exceedingly sinful" (Rom 7:13), if they are going to turn away from it.  The method of the Bible is to use the Law of God (10 Commandments) to bring the conviction of sin and then we give grace.  The Bible is always Law to the proud and grace to the humble (james 4:6).  Read Galations 3:24 and see the law leads a man to Christ.  Don't be afraid to offend someone by showing them they have sinned against God.  A person will not see their need of the cure of the Gospel, if they don't first see their disease of sin.  Otherwise we run the risk of a false conversion 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it was so long-winded and unfocused.  I felt that I was being pulled through the dark forest of the author's mind rather than the concrete experience of other people's pain.  If she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense-maybe 
 What a disappointment! I absolutely loved The Black Pearl but was admittedly  nervous about a sequel. As it turned out, I had every reason to be. It whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original, major or minor, who seemed interesting. That they did but, unfortunately, the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say.  Depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while Keira must have, somehow, pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie. Legolas, I mean, Orlando Bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along, sometimes good but more often, haphazardly. To my mind, the only real interesting addition was that of Davey Jones. Except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying (due to the tentacles 'n all), at least his was a unique addition to the movie. I do sort of object, however, to associating him with the Flying Dutchman legend. The two have nothing to do with each other, fantasy or not. And don't get me started on the cannibals!  Any way, I think this movie merits the two y'ars I gave it. While considerably beneath that first movie, it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times, but it is most definitely not as good.  And, as a final thought, the very last scene of the movie? Lose it entirely. It simply was unnecessary.  
 You are better off getting the Norton Anthology of Poetry.  This book is marketed as a personal selection, yet contains a fairly standard array of poems taken from other anthologies.  Do we need Bloom to select some chestnut by Robert Frost for us 
 The fault may well be mine, but Conquest's prose style is a bit too dense and opaque for me. I purchased the book expecting to be enlightened; the stated purpose is to examine the "brain-blindfolds" that hinder our ability to accurately perceive the political and historical realities of the world. But through the first two chapters I had to repeatedly re-read sentences to try and decipher the point being made. I gave up at the end of chapter two, feeling like a stupid failure. Judging from other reviews written for the hardback edition, there are more astute readers who enjoyed this book and got something of value from it. Good for them. Maybe one of them could write a translation of it for me, or perhaps publish a Dummies version?   Let me provide a sample sentence, and if you can understand it, then by all means get the book: "One trouble, a nasty one, is that the more civilized attitudes of both left and right tend to spill over into their totalitarian variants, or at the minimum into one-sided tolerations, a preference for the more appealing totalitarians over opponents within their own culture, with whom they actually have far less real substantive disagreement." Want to try again? Here, try this one: "More generally, in Europe under the eighteenth-century monarchism, we run into the disorganized current of ideas considered progressive, as against the stasis and stupefaction of the old regimes - a current jammed with flotsam and jetsam, and one that yet flows today, even after socialism has steamed on to shipwreck."   If you not only understood these sentences but enjoyed them, I applaud you and I weep for me!    
 I got an email today to review this book, but I never received it.  I have contacted the customer service department 
 Between sending our country to war over false pretenses (ie; Bush's personal greed), terrible response to Hurricane Katrina, this whole anti-gay thing, and the failure that was No Child Left Behind, I'd have to say that Bush is not a very good leader. That and the guy can't seem to acknowledge  BTW, I myself am not gay but see nothing wrong with it. If you can see it in no other way, the gays might strike back, the way the blacks reacted to whites (and believe me, they had a good reason to) when they were being treated like crap in the '60's. So unless you want riots through your city, you'll at least try to be tolerant. This goes out to all you anti-gay people. And remember; Don't hate people without logical reason! (See, I have good reasons to hate Bush! 
 Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of "Raise the Titanic", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent. Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story  Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved. Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one 
 The clear part turns yellow and there's a thick filmy residual that remains on the fabric.  it's ugly and obviously amateur looking.  would give zero stars if possible.  don't waste your money 
 The description of this product is NOT accurate.  These lights are NOT bright.  I have 6 mounted under the cabinets in my very small kitchen and all 6 on at once add up to the equivalent of a night light.  It is a pretty color of light, but very dim 
 Homely Estefan is a weak vocalist with no talent to speak of. She can't dance, she can't sing well, and she's nothing to look at. She and J-Lo are the worst examples of modern "superstars". They both get by on the flimsiest of talent. In J-Lo's case, it's her artifically pumped up rear end. Anyway, here we have a bunch of vacuous non-songs, even worse than the first volume. At least that had one decent tune, "Words Get in the Way". This doesn't even have that many good songs. And what's this retread of "Conga" doing here? Yuck! It was bad enough in the original version. My true rating: ZERO STARS 
 Elizabeth Danziger in her book Get to the Point attempts to offer readers a game plan to reduce stress and anxiety in an effort to write more effective memos, letters, and e-mails. Danziger is the fonder of WorkTalk, an organization dedicated to improving the communication of individuals and organizations, & she has written for popular magazines such as: Readers Digest and Family Circle. In this book, Danziger offers solid advice on how to deal with writer's block, & in some chapters, she gives visual checklists to help guide readers in the writing process.   However, readers will find the book unfocused; for example, in Chapter2 entitled: Planning your Writing, she has too many headings & subheading; one heading is: Analyze your reader before you start, which is about a half a page, then on the next page, she talks about how to connect with your reader using a 3 level formula.  Yet, no where in the 3 level formula does she go into any detail, then jumps to a topic called "hot buttons" in which she offers little examples of how to determine the "hot buttons" of the writer's audience.   In addition to the lack of focus, you will find that the book is poorly organized. Some chapters have visual examples, and others do not.  Chapter 6, Choose words Wisely, Chapter 7, Help for the Grammar Phobic, & Chapter 8 Mark my Punctuation should have all been combined as they deal with many of the same topics.    All in all, Danziger's book is a good example of a person that might be able to write magazine articles but does not have the ability to write a book.  It's ironic that on the back of the book cover it says, "Get to the point! Is the only writing book you'll ever need" and I am saying this is the only book you should run from don't waste your money on this.   
 I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.   Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books. 
 While few can argue Mark's rise to fame and fortune is anything but spectacular, but to believe that virtually every decision he's made in his life has turned out fantastically well is a bit hard to swallow. At every turn (which happens to be accompanied by the phrase..."I jumped in...") is another remarkable success.   If he showed a bit more vulnerability in his stories, it would have been more believable, insightful and inspirational.   I also could have done without excruciating detail of every season of survivor...it got a bit old 
 Attn all students! Amazon promises to send books by a specific date then changes the dates without your consent. Trying to get a refund is a nightmare. Be prepared to get stuck without the book and still get the bill. Customer service is outsourced to India and is no help even if you could understand them. 4 wks and counting and still no promised refund. This not the only time this has happened.The issue is not with the seller it is Amazon 
 The script outrageously lifts the opening set up from " The Big Chill" until the swarm of mutant flies shows up and attacks the cast. Thats right MUTANT FLIES! The problem is that flies are not scary at all they do not have the shriek factor of spiders, scorpions or roaches. The terrible CGI effects do not help- there are a couple of effective suspense moments-but most of the action takes place in daylight which deminishes the scare factor 
 When you do a search for Shania Twain this video pops up. I can't even find her in the half time show. Is there a football player with the same name? She is the greatest female vocalist of all time and is much prettier than those football players, but I am sure she doesn't play football. LO 
 NOT WORTH THE MONEY 
 This is where the series gets bad. The first half of the book is going along fine, but I cringed every time the plow was mentioned. This was the same feeling I got with the Xenocide ending. The characters come up with  something that they can conceive of in their minds, and so the laws of  phyisics bend to their conception. So it is with Alvin, who theorizes a  ridiculous way to become a real Maker. And because he can conceive of it in  his poorly educated mind, this somehow makes it possible. I really enjoyed  the first two books in the series, but this one just left a bad aftertaste 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 After watching Blue Collar Comedy Tour (The Movie) many times, I was disappointed with the book.  I'm a huge fan of bill Engvall's Here's Your Sign segment on the movie, but the book just wasn't the same.  It's funnier on TV when you can hear Bill Engvall's voice, and the audience reaction.  The jokes in the book just weren't that funny, partially because they weren't delivered live.  I did enjoy the segments with personal stories, as opposed to Here's Your Sign jokes.  The personal jokes were very funny, and I laughed a lot.  This book is one you'll kind of have to flip through...reading it straight through gets boring 
 If you are into religion, this may be a good book for you.  If you are not, it is not 
 CHECK OUT THE SHIPPING COST! IF YOU BUY 1 BAG... IT'S $6.50 JUST TO SHIP IT TO YOU.. SO THAT'S A TOTAL OF NEARLY 10 BUCKS! I SUGGEST YOU GO TO A HEALTH FOOD STORE AND BUY IT AND GET IT FOR MUCH MUCH CHEAPER 
 Using the word spoken by the main character in this book, I am compelled by "candor" to describe what this book is really about.  Only one review reports the "second" story line in the book: the real Duke Lacrosse rape case.  The fictional details follow the facts with little deviation: "[two] wealthy white collegiate tennis players," African-American single mother/stripper.  The fictional prosecutor, like real D.A. Mike Nifong, was appointed by the Governor. It is too bad for Mr. Coben that this book with trial scenes was set in type for printing before the N.C. Attorney General threw out the real rape cases and declared the three lacrosse players "innocent."  If Mr. Coben had guessed correctly at a jury verdict of guilty, his would have been the first fictional account with the likelihood of the sale of movies rights to the book 
 I was excited about this book because I had hoped it would give me insight to gaining understanding about my emotional IQ.  I found the content to be too basic to be of much help to me.  The storytelling style conveyed very little depth.    I took the online test which revealed little.  My scores were in the mid 70s (1-100 scale) and for my age group placed me about 50% above my peer group.  The questions were very pedestrian, (i.e. "Do you understand other people's emotions",  "Can you feel the mood of a room"  "Do you get frustrated?"  At the end of the 28 question test, there was a pitch to buy more of their services and material.    Bottom line is that I got very little from this book and test.      I have gotten better results buying books on the "Hearthmath Program" (Google them and visit their website.  They are a non-profit org and have books also listed on Amazon) and would encourage someone seeking emotional performance and well-being  to persue this avenue instead.  I am not associated with this program, just a happy customer.     I usually don't write reveiw but I felt compelled this time.     
 4 String's first album "Believe" has many great moments - well worth the purchase. I have to agree with the other 2 reviews though that this album is rather disappointing. To point out a few worthwhile listens here: "Until You Love Me" recalls the great feel of "Believe", and the single "Turn it Around" is good as well. "Free" is also not bad... You can find "Turn it Around" on collections by Ultra, so I'd recommend buying those before you purchase this album 
 I ordered this book with high hopes.  The reviews led me to believe it offered concrete suggestions for pressing problems.  It just isn't so.  This book seems to be primarily for people who want to rationalize the status quo: others suffer for reasons you can't influence, you are a good person for just talking about problems in the world while doing nothing about them, etc.  If you believe people who suffer get what they deserve or are simply a side-effect of the glorious free market then this book will be laughable to you.  If you believe making the world better for everyone is the primary obligation for members of "good society" then this book will be disappointing to you.  Etzioni mouths some standard platitudes, for example that we need universal health care, but inevitably either guts his statements by describing that he means something entirely different from what is understood by those statements or he backpedals furiously.  Sometimes he does both at once.  Here's a prime example, again regarding health care: "However, securing everyone a rich basic minimum of health care as a start should no longer be delayed if we seriously seek to move toward a good society".  What exactly is the oxymoronic "rich basic minimum" to which he refers?  We just don't know, and subsequent pages are no help.  As Etzioni reminds us often, this is something for further discussion (outside his book, of course) and dialogue.  From the merely comical "rich basic minimum", we move to the stunningly wrongheaded comment that "there is a profound tension between treating people as ends and as a source of profit".  There is nothing profound about this, nor is there tension except when the market is allowed to have its way with few controls.  Rather than taking the much more "people as ends" focused view that the market must serve society and must be constrained when it fails in that role, Etzioni asks us to believe that we shouldn't always treat other people as people - sometimes they really are commodities to be bought and sold for money.  Perhaps I am especially disappointed because I had such high hopes for this book.  I'm sticking with Amartya Sen and Wendell Berry because even if I don't always agree with them, I can always tell that they care deeply for others and want to offer suggestions for improving the world, not empty cliches 
 I received the DVD and it skips, I was very dissatisfied.  I would have returned it , but since I have never had a problem before, I had thrown the receipt away.  Patrice Trace 
 I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship.  The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from "a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building" to "hot and heavy can't live without each other love"?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene.  Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie 
 i am currently subjecting myself to finance curriculum at a quant-heavy, top-5 bschool.  this text was recommended for my Intro Cap Markets class (although the prof didnt exactly use it in the class).  i often used it to gain understanding of what was taught in class.  unfortunately, i found this book to be EXTREMELY painful.  it was verbose, overly complicated, hard to read, poorly organized & full of jargon.  while it is thorough in its coverage of Capital Markets & instruments, i found it to be nearly impossible to read.  esoteric theories & mathematical proofs were introduced with little background, and often without insufficient detail to understand grasp.  but the jargon & vocabulary are what made the book so unreadable ... trying to read a chapter in this book would literally consume 4-5 hours of my time.  AND forget about trying to use this book to do problemsets OR assignments. i could go on, but trust me, this book is bad ... UNLESS you already have a good intro & just want to use this as a reference 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 The work environment for scientists changes quickly, and the path to changing careers changes as well. This book has been written by people who changed careers YEARS ago -- when minimal skill sets were sufficient to change careers. Learning how to use a word-processor in the 1980s was apparently enough to land you a job in writing or law. Knowing a bit of biology and how to use a computer was enough to get you into the field bioinformatics. Not anymore! This book offers little advice for what a competitive job market is like today, how and where to find employment, and what skills to acquire to take the plunge from lab to a different career 
 The acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive's character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can't possibly know what is going on. I'm still not sure what Jody Foster's character brings to the plot.    Any way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a "s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them. They were disguised as painters. Why couldn't Clive's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine.   Finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn't guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent.  
 I don't think I've ever written a negative review on Amazon before, and I'm sorry to feel compelled to do so.  But this book got in under my radar with the droll concept and amusing cover.  I feel as if someone who looked like they might become a new friend slapped me in the face, not once but repeatedly.  I avoid books that signal early on that they will be full of fat jokes or dripping with contempt for fat people.  As an author, I think that's the laziest sort of humor--like currying favor with prejudiced people by telling racist or sexist jokes.  Let those who find that funny subsidize such humor.  This book waited till p. 14 or so of what had been an amusing story, and by p. 47  I was offended enough not to want to read the rest.  Life is short.  There are many books. I don't have to read books that insult fat women.  I won't totally avoid other books by this author, but I will examine them carefully before buying 
 352 pages of fact after fact without information.  You might get the "when" and "what" of France - if even that.  But no way will you know "why" or "how" or even care when you're done with this book.  I'd burn it but I have to read it for a class 
 Never buy this book! It is extremely short: 1940's-2000's period is covered on 2-3 pages. You will get nothing from it. Simply waaaayyy toooo short. Though practice exams are OK 
 Title says it all, "play to your strengths".  No need to read the "book", or if you must, simply skim at your nearest Borders, Barnes & Noble, or fave store with a reputable coffeehouse.  My quibble is less with the authors' philosophy and more with their writing.  This is simply not a very well written book--no chapters, bold headings every five sentences, and endless laundry lists (43 at last count) of things to do, ways to manage, etc.  Although I agree with the need to appreciate the talents of each unique individual and not dwell so much on a  person's need-for-improvement areas, I did not think the authors proved their points.  They were content to slap down some famous names, rehash a few entrepreneurial successes, and quote the Gallup polls (which were self-serving anyways in light of Clifton's ownership of Gallup).  Please try to waste your money on something better written 
 I bought this in January and it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around.  Now it is an hour off (one hour less than it should be) and won't reset to daylight savings time.  There is a button that resets it if you don't have daylight savings time but it dosent do anything either. Removed and reinserted the battery following instructions endlessly but it is stuck an hour short until the fall.   No reply from the manufacturer.  Beautiful clock but useless half the year 
 It started working fine after waiting forever to charge it for the first time. Won't charge anymore and won't work! Didn't get much use out of it either! Not worth the price 
 There are many good things to say about this text. It is through, has great cross-references, and is relatively cheap. Sadly, however, that is pretty much where the positive ends and the negative begins.  As has been said before, the orgainzation is pretty terrible. No one section fully covers all they want to say about a particular drug, and most medical schools present it in a different fashion. I spend half my time flipping around finding the relevant section about which I want to read.  Also, is it too much to ask that medical textbooks be properly bound? A flimsy paperback with cheap binding simply won't stand up to the rigors of lugging this book back and forth to class every day.  Not Recommended 
 While its wonderful to know that others go through the same trials and tribulations, this is a work that, for me, went no where. No suggestions are made on how to improve a situtation. Rather, the book shows that others are facing many of the same challenges. Some are resolved, others are left wide open with no sense of closure. This book is a waste of time.  
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 Did I expect too much?  I anticipated so much more from Douglas Gresham.  Was he writing for children?  Even children deserve to be treated as if they could understand words of more than one sylable.  Presumably many people who would be interested in reading about C. S. Lewis have some knowledge of the man, this particular book was entirely too condescending.  Who needs to have definitions of simple words explained? In addition, there was almost nothing new in this description of Lewis.  I hardly categorize it as "biography"; more an effort to sell yet another book given the hype over recent notice of Lewis' works.  I could not recommend it in good conscience. Voracious Reade 
 ...for fifty cents, and I would say I probably got my money's worth.  Although the critic who said, "reads like a third-rate middle school book report" might be exaggerating a little, he wasn't exaggerating much.  Also, the book devotes an inordinate amount of time to obscure topics which have not proven to be worth their salt to have more than brief mention in many evolution texts: computer models, evolutionary psychology, and the Theory of Complexity.  There are far more interesting and important issues to discuss.  Morris does a good job of not taking any sides to any of the arguments he presents, as a consequence creating doldrums for over much of the book.  If you must choose between reading this book, taking the wife out shopping all day at the mall, or sawing off your hand with a miter saw, by all means read this book!  However, this is one of the worst pop-science books in this genre that I have read 
 While the literary passages are well chosen and of considerable interest, the experienced gardener will find most of the so called "practical gardening ideas" mostly fluff, and sometimes inaccurate.   In short: a very good idea, poorly executed 
 I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it. 
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 While De Zengotita's ideas are all fine, his writing style is much too convoluted and very often it's difficult to figure out what he is trying to say.  He jumps around a lot and it seems as if he's rambling too much and that there isn't much organization to the book.  I did learn a lot from his ideas, which I thought were great, but his writing was quite terrible 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 This movie seems very popular with a lot of fans, but I have something different to say. I've seen it, once, when I was about 5 1/2. Maybe adults get a kick out of it, my 10 year old brother (at the time) enjoyed it. So, if you're an older viewer than maybe this movie is good, but please, keep it away from young children. This movie terrified me as a small child and I ran out halfway through nearly in tears. Please, doen't be overly anxious to share this with your kids, it may be best to wait a few years. It is one of the most terrifying memories I have as a little girl and I certainly wouldn't wish it to happen to anyone else 
 I purchased the Twist & Shout Multiplication for my grandaughter who is 8 years old.  She has not put it down since she received it.  However mine was malfunctioned and would not give multiple choices.  It would only ask the question and then gave the answer. She was hesitant to give it up when I explained I needed to exchange it for another.  This is the only toy she has that has held her interest for long periods of time.  She nows brags to friends that she knows her multiplication tables 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 I ordered this item on 9/26/06 because I was gone over a weekend and somehow my roomates managed to gunk up my tank royally. I went to Petsmart in person and they didn't have these filters that I need. So I ordered these. I ended up not getting them until the middle of November. that's over a month!!!! I called customer service for Petsmart and the only thing they told me was they would cancel the order and I could go get them from the store. Basic they did absolutly nothing. I would not recommend ordering from Petsmart unless you don't need what you're ordering for a couple of months. 
 If you're interested in the 100 hells of Buddhism and what you will be reborn as in the next life if you live a specific type of way. Or if 1000 years of Buddhist, monastic history interests you, this book is for you. To me its mythology and dogma, with very few practical lessons, if any. 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 This book is probably not helpful to anyone seeking more than VERY basic social skills.  I did not find anything particularly informative.  The writing is long-winded, is generally an midly annoying, boring lecturing style.  At many points, it actually seemed as if the author was not a man, but rather, someone's wife carrying on about the commonplace, stale female gripes and frustrations about how filthy are their men. Where's the male backbone? Not here. The male author seemed to cowtow to the female of the house; it actually looks like he mirrored the concerns of various women consulted and then determined that essential manners require full male compliance.    Also, the title of the book seems misleading due to the very obvious matters discussed.  I thought this book would build an intermediate or advanced level of male manners, but most of the information is irrelevant or too basic to be helpful.   Sorry for the negative report; it was a let-down, but then again I only paid $5 for it. 
 This book is a good dictionary to get an idea of meanings of words, but doesn't give clear definitions, and needs to be revised severely.  Until they come out with a new edition or re-do this one, I would NOT recommend  it 
 I used this shaver for about two months and it was a great disappointment and waste of time. The shaver would only cut close if I went against the direction of the hair. This leads to extreme irritation - I had sores that would last weeks. Unless you want your face to look like that of an acne infested teenager stick to Gillette.  I acknowledge that people's skin is different and some (maybe most?) will experience no irritation. But those with sensitive skin and/or whose beards' hairs change direction should beware. 
 It's not working with my Toshiba Tecra M2 laptop -- it keeps wanting an update to my video driver that doesn't exist 
 This book makes the false assumption that corporations 'are here to remake the world.' The fundamental goal of corporations is profit growth. If that needs a remake of the world, they will do it, otherwise not. By the way, this is also the aim of consultancy firms and one of the reasons why responsible officers are so suspicious of them, seeing the huge fees involved. These officers need them if they want to implement their own policies, but need to present them as necessary measures proposed by outsiders.  The author has also no problem with an amoral market: 'selling grain overseas for a better price ... while people in the village were hungry ... You gave up your loyalty to the village for loyalty to an impersonal exchange that ... would better everyone in the long run.' He forgets that in the short run people in the village (could) starve.   This book treats on the same level, consumer activist Ralph Nader, oil planner Pierre Wack, nonrationalist and LSD-mysticist Willis Harman, futurist Herman Kahn, social psychologist Kurt Lewin, 'kundabuffer' Ivan Gurdjieff, the developers of the 'Managerial Grid' and F-groups or the authors of the Report of the Club of Rome; all this under the superficial dressing of some Middle Age philosophies.  Some ideas developed in this book are important: democratic leadership based on dialogue, group dynamics, the importance of listening and respect, community and self-organized teams, shareholder activism or Jay Forrester's model about the interrelationship between population and economic growth, environment, technology and human aspirations.  It exposes also Herman Kahn's optimistic future where everyone would be affluent and have the chance to be educated. Kahn also didn't foresee the domination of transnational corporations.  All in all, I cannot recommend this book.  N.B. Amfortas has not been wounded by a spear in his groin, but in his genitals 
 Heres the deal - I was told that if I liked South Park, I would like this record and that was definitely not true.  I like South Park and the Parker/Stone films "Baseketball" and "Orgazmo" but I  think this album sucked.  This is an album of crappy music that uses the  success of South Park to sell it.  The only thing I really liked on the  album was the Theme and the Eric Cartman song.  The Chef stuff was somewhat  funny but it was burned out after a few songs.  The music that was  supposedly influenced by South Park is all recycled garbage thats been  heard a thousand times before.  They also put some of the worst bands and  rap artists on this.  Take my advice and listen to it first.  You'll be  surprised at how unfunny it is and how little it has to do with South Park.   P.S. Look into the new South Park movie, Baseketball, and Orgazmo  soundtracks for better music and laughs 
 Everyone (or nearly everyone) seems to love this book. So, we tried it - and had a visceral negative reaction. We read to our daughter every day. I try hard to stop what I am doing and read to her when she comes toddling up with a book in her hands. For the sake of sanity, we've experimented with picture books, particularly rhyming picture books, but really anything with very brief text so we don't go completely mad with repetition. This is NOT behavior we wanted to introduce to our toddler daughter. That said, when she's older and able to understand that the pigeon's behavior is not to be emulated, we might give this another try. maybe 
 Unless you have to read everything Faulkner wrote, save your time here.  It's better than Soldier's Pay, Mosquitoes, and Sanctuary, but that isn't much to aspire to.  Here and there an interesting thought comes up, but if you're short on time or energy, spend it working through Absalom, Absalom!  That will save your soul.  You can listen to Jagger sing Parachute Woman and get the same material  in a better medium.  Pylon, however, is a good word 
 I think it is hard for me to reconcile the fact that this is the sequel to Pink Slip, which was truly funny and smart. This follows the mariage of Eben and Lisa, but isn't as warm or touching. It is pretty realistic abou thte difficulties of marraige but deosn't show the joys very well. Lisa strikes me as very off-putting in this.  i agree with another reviewer who was just as puzzeld as I about the disappearance of family and friends-I loved those characters (especially Lisa's Mom) in book 1.  Without these characters, the book is very neurotic and Lisa frankly seems self-obsessed.  Even with my gripes, I still say Ciresi is a very good author. I kept right on reading the book to see how it would end.    
 I wish I had read this about 30 years ago. A lot of practical information with her usual wit and humour.  Alexandra is always personal, warm and human.  
 If you bother to parse the author's execrable writing, you find that he has very little to say about whatever it is French people do to avoid obesity.   Instead, he goes off on tangents. He tells cutesy anecdotes about family members that probably aren't even interesting to his other family members. Having established the the French are more inclined to eat organic produce and natural-sourced food than Americans, he then fills PAGES with irrelevant (and dumbed-down) factoids about chemicals in food.  If (as he says) the French aren't big on surgical solutions to obesity (e.g., stomach stapling and liposuction), why has he included an entire rambling chapter on them?  In fact, you might wonder how how someone as apparently incapable of getting to the freaking point as Clower got a PhD.    But if he just stuck to the point, he wouldn't have a book--he'd have a short, not-well-supported essay suitable for peddling to one of the less-renumerative ladies' mags.  Unsurprisingly, he sticks to the hard-to-quantify, touchy-feely (and generally useless) explanations for how the French stay thin and avoids mentioning the one contributing factor that most epidemiologists agree on: The French smoke like chimneys 
 This book started well in its flashback scene but like Berry's other books, it is just average.  All of his characters are stereotypes and his female characters (in nearly all his books) are all the same bitchy, arrogant, sexpots who need a man to rescue them.  The main female character in this book was about the most objectionable.  She is a high powered judge (so of course she has let the power go to her head and it has ruined her marriage to the likable attorney.)  However, after she is drugged, raped and saved by her ex husband she realizes she should give up her high powered career, go to work for her husband,and concentrate on being a wife and mother.  Wow -- the more-powerful-and successful-than her spouse is given what she had coming (a rape --which is just a man asserting his power over a woman) and then she all of a sudden realizes her place in the world.  Nice.  If this kind of characterization was an isolated incident in his books, I'd say, "Overlook it as bad writing" but since it is sort of the norm, I think Mr. Berry might need some professional help. BTW-- The virgin Mary comes off pretty good in The Third Secret so it isn't ALL his female characters, but any character less than the mother of God is characterized very badly.  
 I realize that Patterson is known for his exciting, page-turning reads.  I realize that he is famous for the relentless pace of his novels.  And, most importantly, I realize that he is famous for stunning twists at the endings of lots of his books.  Keeping all that in mind, I have to say that I was shocked and hurt by the, well, absolutely horrifying surprise ending to this book.  To say it came at me out of left field would be a massive understatement.  It's more like I was standing at home plate in Dodger stadium and was hit by a ball thrown from left field in Yankee Stadium.  Truthfully, I never saw it coming.  And I was horrified by it.  I finished the last pages with my mouth hanging open.  And I feel betrayed as well.  I realize that twist endings happen often, especially when it comes to Patterson, but I DID NOT LIKE this one.  I felt hurt by it.  Putting that aside, it was a good read overall, which is why I give it 2 stars instead of one 
 As someone interested in the Russian Revolution, I found this book at a school library and read it. I was not favorably impressed. Lenin is pushed down to the level of megalomaniac idiot. You don't have to like the guy to try to really explain his motivations or to seek real answers to the questions that bamboozle people. In addition to the pyscho-babble mentioned by other reviewers, I had a problem with Robert Service picking on someone who is to dead to sue him for slander. Robert Service accuses Lenin of shooting down his own Soviet troops (an absolute idiocy in the middle of a civil war).It may be fashionable to produce "exposes" of Soviet leaders, but that doesn't make it a good trend. Modern biographers of the Russian revolutionaries need to remember that Joe McCarthy and his Committee are no longer here to black-list them. In Robert Service's biography, I was upset to find the author judging Lenin through 21st century glasses. By this I mean: 1. Cutting out the context of the Russian economy's ruin during the Civil War. 2. The abject failures of the "democrats"  3. Forgetting what the alternatives would have been had the opposition won (I don't mean the Whites- even the peasants hated them) I wonder what Mr. Service would do if he were in Lenin's shoes...  While I'm wondering, I think I'll go pick up W. Bruce Lincoln's books on how the revolution happened and what happened during and after the civil war 
 After reading these reviews and taking Anna Lee's very sage advice to try it via the library first, now I understand.  It looks as if Mr. Gordon had several of his friends jump in and write reviews to get Ms. Lee's unfavorable review off the front page.  Being the suspicious type, I checked out these reviewers, and they have all written only one review each, all giving Mr. Gordon five stars for his book, all within days of each other.    But no matter.  Typical lawyer tactics don't impress me and neither did this typical lawyer's book.  Having spent most of my adult life in the music industry in NYC and elsewhere, I have experienced just about everything in this business, and I am only sorry that Ms. Lee and so many others had to listen in person to this gentleman's spiel, as that's what The Future of the Music Business turns out to be: a spiel.    Yes, he has the requisite case studies with "indie" artists giving it a go on their own as an attempt to add cred to his manuscript, but Mr. Gordon (or perhaps his ghostwriter) knows nothing about digital technologies, that is apparent, nor does he offer his readers any new solutions.  He is very much from the old school where the only game in town was the nearest major label that pulled all the purse strings.  Now that the Internet has obliterated that, formerly holier-than-thou industry types are finding themselves at a real loss as for how to deal with it, and we see plenty of old dogs with half-a$$ed new tricks to push on the public.   The only advice I have for those in this new music industry, and it's free:  Carve your own niche instead of trying to fit the ones sculpted by the suits.  In these strange times where Kelly Clarkson, et. al., are unbelievably considered punk rock, we are definitely due for some big changes.  The markets are changing with the emergence of India and China, not to mention a European Union with over 450 million people.  Add the Internet to this mix and you have the opportunity for many niche markets to evolve without the current major label system as a constituent.  The Internet is integrating into and changing the very nature of TV and radio as we know them, and amen to that.  Mr. Gordon deserves credit for one thing and one thing only: his book is no better or no worse than anything else out there.  
 ...not a musician.  What I see in the negative reviews is a desire for Rod the Musician to return to old form. What I detect in the positive reviews is an enjoyment of Rod as an entertainer. Some people value musical chops and creativity- others simply want to be nostalgic and entertained. Rod converted long ago from  musician to Vegas entertainer.  If you want a taste of some old rockers who remain creative musicians, sample Robert Plant's or Neil Young's latest. Don't waste your time on Rod or this kitsch 
 I can not comment on a book that I have not received yet 
 This movie was a complete letdown. They tried to cross Cujo with The Terminator. Interesting concept, but the script completely lacks any real oomph. Awful film. Lance Henriksen deserved better 
 I used this book as a last minute replacement in teaching a collegiate, first year poetry class -- the anthology I intended to use had it's publication date pushed back. As such, I used it essentially sight unseen, figuring the low price would cover my not having seen it first hand. But even with the price I was terribly embarrassed for using it.   This is a miserably constructed work. Its discussions of poetry are ridiculously shallow, frequently to the point of being incorrect or misleading. It is written at the level of someone whose knowledge of poetry and poetics was gained only through reading other poor anthologies, at the level of someone who could not ever successfully demonstrate any sophistication or depth of knowledge in the field. I would be embarrassed by this book even if I was teaching _high school_ freshmen. As far as the art of poetry is concerned, as far as even _basic_ knowledge of poetry is concerned, this is less than drivel. And all the worse because of how deceiving it can be. If someone read this with no knowledge of poetry and spoke from it as a source of authority, they would frequently find themselves looking quite foolish. To me that is an egregious fault.  Yet more bleakly hilarious than how poor are the discussions is how bad the writing is. There are many places where the writing looks like it was edited from five pages to one paragraph, taking two sentences a page to make the condensation. And too often I came upon places where the poor writing created misconceptions. You would think that someone who makes their living as an author would have a little more pride in their work than permitting this to be published in their name. The writing is bad enough that I now have no desire to ever crack one of Mayes's novels.  Just to say, as an anthology, it is tolerable. There is a decent selection of poems for the price. (And it is only the price that makes it tolerable.) But in using it you will quickly find that while there may be a variety of authors, there is not a great variety of styles -- that is, there might be one or two representatives of a style or technique, but rarely enough to create a demonstration toward understanding. I was often (in my class) frustrated by not being able to find a representative of styles of verse that should be present in number in any anthology. Too much of it is contemporary, and too much of that rather unremarkable poetry. There is not nearly enough non-contemporary poetry to name itself a "field guide," not nearly enough variety to even be considered a decent sampling of the art form.  Stay away from it. It is not well crafted. For the errors and misconceptions you should definitely look elsewhere -- if you look to this to teach you something, what it will teach you (how little that is) will be error-ridden. Spend the extra money and get something of value. As someone who claims to love poetry, Mayes has done the art a great wrong, mocking it by speaking of it carelessly, revealing through her shallow presentation how little she's truly devoted herself to poetry's secrets and graces 
 Update:  I think I've figured out why they've made the changes which take away much of the Magick that is Riverdance.  The people I work with know how crazy I am about all things Celtic.  So, bless 'em, they thought I would like Michael Flatley's latest creation, Celtic Tiger, and got me that for my holiday gift this year.  After watching that HIDEOUSLY TACKY travesty of a show, it seems like whoever is in charge of RD these days is trying to compete with Sacred meets Vegas and Vegas wins junk that Mr. Flatley has produced!  So, come on, take RD back to it's Magickal, Lovely, Sacred Roots!           What are they thinking?  Who changed the number that originally featured Davey Spillane playing the pipes?  Why on Earth would anyone want to take one of the most soul-hauntingly lovely pieces of Sacred Musick ever written amd make subtle alterations to it?  And the sound quality of the tape leaves a lot to be desired!  As always, the performers are AWESOME!  And I've gotten over the trauma of knowing that I'll never get to see Michael and Jean live!  Just kidding about the trauma part, however the RD of my dreams DEFINIETELY has those two in the lead roles!  But come on, a Lugh with black hair!  The best Lugh I've actually seen live was Patrick Roddy.  The best Brigit I've seen live is Eileen Martin.   The last time I saw RD live was about a year ago, and this was the version that I saw and it kind of made me think that RD was trying to go Hollywood!  However, there were a few good things about the changes.  The narration about how it's all a journey from one lifetime to the next and the inclusion of the Shivna number!  It's quite good!  I wouldn't realy advise buying this tape unless you are a RD nut like I am and buy anything about RD that you can get your hands on!   
 what's that book about? rebellion? i don't think to be a rebel is necessary to have sex with everyone you meet, both male and female. is the intent of the author to shock you? he didn't shock me, he just disgusted me.  i didn't like this book at all, and if you are looking for a book with a meaning, you won't like this one 
 I was really excited about this toy. I was very forgetful when it came to putting my son on his tummy, so I thought this would be a great toy for him to  have some good quality tummy time on. Wrong. He could care less about this toy. The second I'd lay him in front of it he would just roll onto his back. He was five months old when we bought it, and it is just sitting there. He STILL loves his Gymini and he is six months old now. Also, by the third day the aquarium had sprung a leak..which apparently has happened to almost everyone who  has bought this thing. Do not  purchase this toy, it takes up too much space, and it's a waste of money. Baby could care less about it 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 I wish sellers would give more information about their books, what year published and define the conditions better or if the book is hardcover or paperback.  I am trying to order one for a friend and did but it's 1974 and wasn't stipulated at time of purchase.  Are there any more current dated ones 
 I bought this crap on a half whim/half single basis. I thought "when you sleep" was pretty good, so I decided to give the rest of the album a shot. First of all, "when you sleep" is very misleading. The entire album is much more mellow and sounds nothing like it, and had I known it was weird british crap, I would have passed anyway. Think Keane, but much MUCH worse. Not possible? I thought so, but I was wrong. There isn't anything rock or anthemic about it, its just badly produced brit-pop with annoyingly slow tempos. With this being the second awful CD I've purchased on a whim in the last month, I think it's time to take a break. Thanks Long-view, thanks alot. AVOID! 
 A friend who knows my taste in music recommended VNV Nation to me, so I got Matter + Form based on the reviews.  In one sense I like it.  The production is excellent and I find every track to be creative and unique.  But I HATE the vocals and so I can't bear to listen to the CD.  This dude has the worst voice in music history.  
 I think they need to be just a LITTLE more original.  I mean sure, the Dandy Warhols sounded like Neil Young for awhile early in their career and Oasis was known for 'borrowing' from the Beatles, but jesus, these *!:&ing kids don't have a lick of originality in their music.  They basically use the exact same vocal and instrumental arrangements as their predecessors. (if you even consider these people anything other than a cover band)  If they come up with something that sounds even REMOTELY like the redwalls (whoever they are) I'll consider calling it an album. Until then we'll stick with calling it a practice session 
 I purchased the first Symphony of Enchanted Lands along with Unholy Warcry. I liked them enough that I decided to get what was at the time Rhapsody's latest offering. I knew full well what I was getting into: cheesy dialogue, over-the-top vocals, and fast guiter wankery.  Well, when I was able to give this album a listen, I was disappointed.  My main gripe with SoEL II is the amount of dialogue, which I guess isn't so bad, but I grew bored of it by my third listen to the album. I ended up ripping each track and creating my own CD with select songs from this album.  The music itself is enjoyable, especially if you're already a fan of Rhapsody. However, this album was just not to my liking 
 When Bob Clark gave us the original back in the 75 and threw a young Margot Kidder in as a boozing sorority sister who along with the rest are being terrorized by a killer living upstairs in the attic his intentions were to give us a scary movie and not much blood.As a result it worked for the most part.Oh before I forget, Rest in peace Bob Clark.He died at 67 in a head on which also killed his son last week.This version directed by Glen Morgan brings gore and eye balls popping out every chance he gets.Hey there's even a scene where an icicle falls off the roof and pierces through Andrea Martin head.Its laughable! She would of had a better death if she let the killer did it.The acting is so-so but nothing worth noting.They're spoiled girls and very vulgar when they speak.You'll probably do what I did after a while and root for the killer 
 A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity.  
 The book has beautiful artwork, but I did not find this age appropriate for the three year old it was purchased for. Perhaps better aimed at 5-6 year old 
 I liked this machine while it worked, but I started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago.  I got busy and suddenly the warranty was up, and then the other day, it just wouldn't turn on at all.  I had it for 15 months 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 I liked the pace, flow ,and language of this novel. My problems stemmed from character behavior, having grown up in Texas I could not relate to these boys. I can not imagine any scenario where a groupsof teenage boys would get together to go have sex witha calf. I'm not naive to think this has never happened, it muight even happen on a regular basis, but not as a group activity with half the high school there to watch. Like ise there is no great homophobic group than teenage boys and for the author to say they made a habit of grabbing for each other's privates came across as unbelievable. Once I can't beleive a books characters, I no longer care about the story.   
 My beef with this book is that out of the 216 pages, only about 90 pages actually deal with integrating Access and Excel (or vice versa).  I'm not sure what the author was trying to do here, but most of the book focuses in on using Excel VBA to do various things such as link to SQL server data, automate Word, automate Outlook, and some other things. He spends a little time on the Access perspective, but nothing meaningful.  Frankly this book reads like a collection of code snippets that are vaguely related to data processing. This is a brave attempt at something that has never been done, but this short book falls short of the goal espoused in the title.    P.S.  For any O'Reilly reps reading this, $40 is alot to ask for when you're talking about a 200 page book; especially when you're talking about code that can be gathered on the net for free. tisk...tisk     
 What a deceptive Title.   "Yes, the Shroud of Turin is real, but Christianity is NOT," should be the actual title.  Five facts "horribly" ignored by Hoare:  The amount of body trauma, especially the side wound... indicates this man was dead. The Roman spear ruptured the "pericardium," causing the fluid described as "blood AND WATER" being released. The side wound stain consists of this fluid.  The man's legs are UNBROKEN. Thus, the Romans considered this crucifixion victim dead.  The body image gives the appearance of RIGOR MORTIS.  The blood stains are merely the oozing that occurs after trauma... it's a little known fact that bodies that have suffered long and traumatic deaths will continue to ooze blood post mortem. The majority of the blood that covered this man had been washed away.  This fact has been established just recently by Shroud researchers.  And obviously, no "natural" explanation for image formation will suffice. If a natural process did occur, it is most certain that duplicates to the Shroud of Turin would have been found and collected.  The evidence that legitimatizes the Shroud is otherwise documented in this book, thus it escapes my one star rating. "Irrefutable" indeed!   Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "The Shroud of Torrington."      
  I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition.  
 This is just a warning not to buy the censored version of this album. Make sure you get the proper version.  Tracks 4 and 8 of disc 3 have some horrible noise put on to mask the lyrics, which makes the songs unlistenable. It would have been better not to have put the tracks on the album than to release them in this format.  I would refuse to buy censored music on principle and it is a mystery to me why Prince, who spent years in a dispute with his record company over artistic freedom, should release censored music.   By the way, the music is wonderful and I recommend the album 100%. But make sure you don't buy censored music 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 David Mamet has written or directed several of the better films of the past quarter century. I love STATE AND MAIN, HOUSE OF GAMES, THE SPANISH PRISONER, and very much like THE WINSLOW BOY and HEIST. The ground beneath Mamet is very shaky. His characters are often fools because they don't see the truth not only about themselves, but about the world we live in. Mamet knows the truth, the subtext of his work tells us. I didn't realize until reading this book that he doesn't have a clue what truth is. He is lost in a sea of cynicism and self-told lies -- Eastern European Jews predominate among movie directors because of a shared genetic inheritance, as an example. (Nazis had the same idea, but genetics favored them, they thought.) Mamet uses historical referrences to substantiate his points, and almost always misinterprets them. He talks about Jackie Kennedy trying to crawl out of the limousine where he husband had been fatally shot as proof that we are all cowards, this when the truth was that she was placing herself in jeopardy trying to retrieve some of her husband's body matter in the hope that everything could somehow be made right.   Here is the truth -- we are all capable of cowardice, and outrageous acts of courage. We are all fools, and at the same time possess surprising wisdom. We are far more complex than the cynical, meager, narrow world view of David Mamet. Watch his movies -- they're fun (sometimes), but avoid this book, whose author comes across as self-important, arrogant and repulsive 
 I bought the cabinet awhile ago now and the first thing I noticed was that the "lock" was plastic, the second was that it didn't even reach the slot made for it to keep the door closed.  Now I've started noticing that the front doors are sagging from the weight of the DVD's inside.  Not worth it, and isn't worth taking with on a move 
 I have tried to get the "All Purpose Spatula" twice and Amazon has sent me a spoon/spatula which is completely different and doesn't match this description.  
 Do not waste your money.  I agree with everyone else. The idea of the game is great, but completing some of the missions on the DVD are pretty much impossible.  Figuring out the codes are ok, but trying to sneak past a security camera or security laser beams are totally random. The reaction of the green dot (the agent) does not correspond with you hitting the arrow button on the dvd remote. We hit it a lot of different times and the dot moved when it wanted to and it was always into the sight of the camera or security laser beam. No skill, no strategy. Jack Bauer yells at you and makes you feel like an idiot when you can't get it.  There's no way, I believe that this game was tested out on anyone. How can they make a game that can't be won, except by random luck.  I feel they used the "24" name and put together a shotty DVD game.  And the board is useless.  The game was frustrating to say the least. I plan on returning it.  
 William O'Neil is perhaps the one individual responsible for my development as a trader and investor.  I consider How to Make Money in Stocks to be one of the most valuable books on stock trading.  I cannot say the same for this one.  In fact, I found it to be a complete waste of both my time and money.  There was not a single new or insightful bit of information in the text.  If I could give it 0 stars I would 
 Although these are rated for use in an oven up to 500 degrees, mine cracked the first time I used them in an oven (which was only set to 375 degrees).  They are pretty thin (not much thicker or heavier than dinner plates, really), so don't inspire a lot of confidence when you hold them.  So really they should get zero stars.  But if you don't plan to use them in the oven, but just as serving dishes they would be cute 
 If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"  
 Man what Can I say... Definitely one of the best albums of 2006. VOL 2 STARTS OFF A LITTLE SLOW BUT ONCE BUSTA AND HITEK GET YOU "MARCH"IN THIS CD CONTAINS QUALITY TRACK AFTER QUALITY TRACK. THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE. BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW!!!!!!! 
 "Knits From a Painter's Palette: Modular Masterpieces in Hand Painted Yarn" is what I expected from the title of the book, pictures I had seen of it and the reviews I read.  I am not one bit sorry I bought it.  But I wish it was so much more than it is.  Having knit with Painter's Palette, I can attest that the yarn is close to magical, a magic the book does not get across at all.  Charlotte's Web, for example, why would anybody photograph this beauty with the light behind it, focusing on the pattern which is not what the shawl is about at all? I suggest that anyone who wants to understand Charlotte's Web in Painter's Palette google it to see what it really looks like.  Probably the photos of the Butterfly Poncho best convey the beauty of the yarn, but in general, neither the photography nor the modular knitted items do Painter's Palette justice.  I realize Maie Landra is an artist and expert knitter, but modular knitting is not new and the results  actually appear more restricted than innovative so it's puzzling that she would find it particularly interesting.    Koigu is wonderful, I am grateful to Landra for it, I would never not have bought this book, but can't we have a second one with a few more garments ordinary knitters like me could dream about making or maybe even actually make? And please, please, different art directors, photographers, etc.--in fact, how about a different publisher altogether as this one clearly wasn't up to the job 
 This book is very interesting- some of the "facts" in this book were unbelievable! It turns out they were just that- untrue, such as...   *If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb.  *Humans swallow an average of 8 spiders in their lifetime during their sleep.   *The avarage sneeze travels at 600 mph.    I could go on and on... my point is, this book is full of unresearched claims that the author passes on as facts. If you want a book completely full of bull***, get this piece of trash. If you want the facts, get a book that actually at least researches claims before publishing them 
 Not the best book to read on the subject, lacked a lot of information and found it to be not very interesting. Have read better ones on this subject 
 Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 This is one of those Sony CD's that contains "XCP" spyware.  XCP was written with the intent of concealing its presence and operation from the owner of the computer, and once installed, elements of the software run continuously -- even when no Sony-BMG music CD is in use. It provides no clear uninstallation option.   Additionally, without notifying users, the software appears to contact a remote machine under your control.   Sony has shocked and angered people over this issue. Software that deceives the owner of the computer it runs upon and opens that computer up to attacks by third parties may be expected to come from malicious cyber-attacks; it is certainly not expected nor acceptable to be distributed and sold to paying customers by a major music company.   Sony should temporarily halt manufacturing CDs with XCP and reexamine "all aspects" of their "content protection initiative."   If Sony truly intends to undo the harm that they have caused, they should immediately and publicly commit to the following measures:   1) Sony should recall all CDs that contain the XCP and SunnComm MediaMax technology. It must include removing all infected CDs from store shelves as well as halting all online sales of the affected merchandise.   A recent New York Times article said that well over 2 million infected CDs with the XCP technology are in the marketplace and have yet to be sold.   2) Sony should remove from all current and future marketing materials statements like that on http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/english/updates.html that say the cloaking software "is not malicious and does not compromise security."   3) Sony should widely publicize the potential security and other risks associated with the XCP and SunnComm MediaMax technology to allow the 2.1 million consumers who have already purchased the CDs to make informed decisions regarding their use of those CDs. The publicity campaign should include, at a minimum, issuing a public statement describing the risks and listing every Sony CD, DVD or other product that contains XCP or SunnComm MediaMax. The publicity campaign should be advertised in a manner reasonably calculated to reach all consumers who have purchased the products, in all markets where the CDs have been sold.   4) Sony should cooperate fully with any interested manufacturer of anti-virus, anti-spyware, or similar computer security tools to facilitate the identification and complete removal of XCP and SunnComm MediaMax from the computers of those infected. In particular, Sony should publicly waive any claims it may have for investigation or removal of these tools under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and any similar laws.   5) Sony should offer to refund the purchase price of infected CDs or, at the consumer's election, provide a replacement CD that does not contain the XCP or SunnComm technology. For those consumers who choose to retain infected CDs, develop and make widely available a software update that will allow consumers to easily uninstall the technology without losing the ability to play the CD on their computers.   In addition, consumers should not be required to reveal any personally identifying information to Sony in order to access the update, as Sony is currently requiring.   6) Sony should compensate consumers for any damage to their computers caused by the infected products, including the time, effort, and expenditure required to remedy the damage or verify that their computer systems or networks were or were not altered or damaged by XCP or SunnComm MediaMax products.   I'm not buying any more Sony CD's until they do the above! 
 I can't believe that this is recommended reading for grade 9 and up. Had I been assigned this for reading at grade 9, I would have read as much as necessary to get a C on whatever project was associated with the assignement and not felt the least bit of guilt.  Fast forward to the present...I picked this book up (only b/c I've seen a number of references to it) and forced myself to complete it (reading 3 or 4 other books in between - which is indicative of its ability to capture the average reader's interest).  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book for reading if you're a passive literary buff.  But if you want to say you've read an author's author (for casual conversation) or you are given this as assigned-reading (lucky you!), then you're going to have to make an effort to stay awake. This book can easily lose you (and your interest) with its level of detail. The story is very basic - family cheats another family; cheated family curses cheating family; cheating family experiences generations of misfortune - but the message, theme, etc. gets lost in the soup of details.  Don't be suckered into thinking this is any kind of supernatural thriller. It's definitely not scarey and is far from a thriller. One prop I will give is the description of the house has seemed to make it into every B-horror-flick (either in look or spirit) I've seen 
 NOTE: This review is not about the trilogy (which is great). This review is about the many DVD releases.  The worst thing that ever happened to George Lucas is when Peter Jackson released the Extended Version of LOTR. Jackson showed fans we could demand, expect, and receive more from Hollywood. The impact of Peter Jackson sent shock waves among fans, who released a four-disc edition of one of the greatest movies of all time. Even old Hollywood guards, like Ridley Scott and James Cameron (no surprise they are not Americans) took notice and improved their DVD releases. This change has been powerful, except in the case of Lucas and to some degree his pal Steven Spielberg, who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers.   The many re-releases shows greediness, stubbornness, and lack of respect for fans. No one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version, but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality. In addition, please stop using the "Limited Edition" you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of Star Wars; it is both false and tiring. Release these films in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 Surround Sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release.  Lucas's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his Star War movies. Unfortunately, his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar. His shady practice of video/DVD releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him.  One must wonder what went through Lucas mind when Peter Jackson won an Academy Award for Best Director and not him. Maybe if he focus on making quality films (like he once did) and not playing the DVD re-re-re-release game, then he could win one.   
 While I rarely subscribe to magazines, I was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so I signed up for a one year subscription to Shape. Before and during college I was a ballet dancer, but after entering the real, 9-5 working world half a year ago, exercise time became more difficult to find. Unfortunately, I found that Shape magazine was not really about exercise at all. It was about beauty products, fancy new-age spas and resorts, and trendy workout accessories. I was also shocked by the models on the magazine's covers and pages. Not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing. I finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through, lacy top on the front of it, visible nipples and all. Workout wear? I think not! Trust me, the woman belonged in a porn magazine, not my exercise magazine 
 My partner and I bought this book in hopes that it would be a good read for our daughter in the future (she turned 8 months old today!). From what we've read of this book so far all of these stories are from children who were born into heterosexual families  with one parent coming out, whereas our daughter was conceived, born and raised with two mommies. Since the stories are all from kids who have a gay or lesbian parent our daughter will, at least, have that in common 
 I began reading Forever Amber last week (hoping to find a book I might like while I waited for another one to come available at the Library) and from the first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this book.  But I am one of those readers that feels if a book is started then you should finish it.  Upon finishing it I feel cheated.    The book isn't all that bad.  There is a lot of movement, intrigue and history in it.  But I couldn't feel for the characters.  The main character, Amber, was not someone that I would like and even when things went wrong for her, I still felt that way.  I assume that no one is supposed to like her.  And although I didn't like any of the characters in this book, I guess I did feel something for Amber because I felt like she should be with Lord Carlton...up in until the last part of the book.  Then I realized that she shouldn't be with anyone.    The reason for the two stars is because of the ending.  I hated that ending.  I felt totally cheated after reading the whole 700 plus pages and then the book ending so abruptly.  I agree with others who have left reviews here, it seems that the author decided that she either didn't want to write anymore of this book or she ran out of things to write about.    Anyway, it was an okay book to keep me occupied until the book I have been waiting for becomes available but I would never recommend this book to anyone. It's really not worth the time.   I guess you either love the book or you hate it.  And I hated it. 
 I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what I have come to expect from Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between Maggie and Zack. None at all. So it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller 
 I ordered this book and realized the day after I placed the order that my boyfriend had bought it for himself. When I emailed the seller to see if it was too late to cancel my order and the reason I got no response. I sent another email 2 days later and I still never received a response. I then got the book (which I'm stuck with) and not even in good condition! BAD EXPERIENCE 
 I found this book extremely boring.  While there are few interesting parts, Rousseau found it necessary to relate detail after monotonous detail.  Composing over 600 pages, this book would of been less tiring given half the length.  
 I picked up this book because it sounded like something that EVERYONE should read.  We definitely need to slow down, become involved in our communities and bring more happiness back into our lives.  What I was subjected to in this book, however, was the author's political rants about how Conservatives have ruined this country!  I'm an independent and I actually felt sorry for any conservative who might be reading this book - it was harsh.  We are ALL a part of the problem, which makes us ALL a part of the solution.  She does have some great quotes and some ideas that sound good no matter what your political party may be - hence the two stars.  The joy is hidden in the vitriol in this book 
 Sheila Fitzpatrick has written that the total number of those murdered by the Soviets is in the "low hundreds of thousands."  In other words, she is a crank. There are numerous books out debunking Fitzpatrick and her fellow apologists for Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Yale University's "Annals of Communism" series is a good place to start.   "In Denial: Historians, Communism & Espionage" by John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr is an excellent read on how Fitzpatrick and other academics distort facts and lie through omission to cover up the atrocities of Lenin, Zinoviev, Radek, Trotsky, Stalin et al.   Fifteen years ago, Fitzpatrick's apologies for a regime which murdered over 20 million of its own citizens could have been (weakly) defended. Now that the Soviet archives have been opened and we have testimony from those involved in the regime, her book is simply inexusable.   Read "A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia"  by Alexander N. Yakovlev and Anthony Austin.  Yakovlev was the architect of perestroika. He was a communist. He had access to documents western researchers have not yet seen. Yakovlev details how the regime was a criminal organization from its founding. It never had the support Fitzpatrick claims it did.       
 This novel is comprised of pretty, well constructed sentences.  That's about all it is.  Pretty, well constructed sentences.  The story itself could be interesting, after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested, let alone awake.  The narrator, although the main character, was so far removed, emotionally, from her own telling of the story, that you wondered why she had bothered.    At time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told.  
 It;s alright but ot really worth buying at full price, buy it used. The information presented is alright at best but the author really dosent touch on all the subjects proclaimed in the title, One the cover part of the subtitle reads Fairy Lore, theres hardly any of this present. If you are seeking an excelent book on the green craft then I reccomend HEALING WISE BY SUSUN WEE 
 More work for mother?  Gimmie a break!!  This book attempts to further the fiction that it's women who are still doing the housework.  While this may have been true 40 years ago, the feminization of the American male that's occurred since then makes this a thing of the past.  Just look around!  Men are pushing strollers, cleaning houses, cooking dinners, involved in selecting dcor, PLUS doing all the "men's work" that they previously did, such as yard work, fixing the car, and doing all those other heavy and dirty jobs.  To make matters worse, these are often men who work demanding jobs with lots of travel to bring in the money, often for wives that are just sitting home on their asses!  When these men come home from a grinding business trip, the wife is on them to "be more involved," so you see them running around killing themselves around the house and with the kids while their wives are over at the spa or having coffee with their yenta friends.  More work for Mother?  The book we need is "Modern Marriage:  What's in it for Father? 
 Let's start with P52, that credit card sized piece of papyrus, thought to be the oldest surviving scrap of scripture of the Gospel of John.  Mr. Ehrman repeatedly mentions that it was found in a "trash heap in Upper Egypt."  In fact, Mr. Ehrman does this every single time P52 is mentioned.   To paraphrase Ralph Manheim, "It is the half educated writer, without clear ideas, who generally feels that to say a thing only once is rather slight."  Mr. Ehrman is much too intelligent to be doing this by accident.  Therefore I believe it is done with purpose, and done oddly enough, without seeming too concerned about in which city it was discovered.  According to Dr. Bruce Metzger, to whom Mr. Ehrman dedicates his new book,  Misquoting Jesus, that fragment "was purchased in Egypt as early as 1920, but it sat unnoticed for years among similar fragments of papyri."  Hey, I thought a trash heap was a mountain of garbage one finds in a landfill with vermin crawling about and seagulls flying overhead.  Now it seems to include any stack of papyri that may contain holy scripture.  If that isn't a giveaway, I don't know what is.  While Mr. Ehrman gleefully tears apart any possibilities that most of the apocrypha could have any credibility (he claims nearly all of them are fakes or forgeries, and probably correctly), he nonchalantly mentions off the cuff that all but seven of the New Testament books are forged as well (those seven themselves also being tampered with)  The latter is, I believe, the real purpose for writing this book.  Lacking the courage to make this the focused topic, he covertly "slipped it in."  Since then he has made it the focus of a book called Misquoting Jesus.   The tendency for conspiracy theory to emanate from Mr. Ehrman is common.  There can be many reasons why so many more recently hand copied manuscripts of the New Testament differ from the oldest ones.  Mr. Ehrman points to large political movements most often while ignoring some more obvious reasons.  Case in point:  the Gospel of Mark.  He says the earliest copies show Jesus reacting angrily to just about everything.  Reasoning that the older versions must be the correct ones, Mr. Ehrman assumes the newer copies were purposely changed in order to sound more like Matthew, Luke, and John.  Could it actually be possible that these oldest copies have survived through the ages because it was known back then that they were wrong?  Consider that a scribe or two might've thought that a "compassionate" Jesus was rather wimpy and so rewrote Him to be angry all the time to show a more powerful God.  These "angry" copies were then set aside by church elders from the other often read "compassionate" copies and preserved for any number of reasons, perhaps as examples of bad behavior by "foolish knaves."  While the correct copies were handled so much that they fell apart and were discarded.  Just look at your own bookshelf.  The books that last the longest are the ones read the least.  It is an incorrect assumption on Ehrman's part that the oldest known copies were the only copies written at that time.    Regarding the differences among the four Gospel accounts:  If scribes were so prone to make the Gospels sound alike by changing them, why after 2,000 years and countless hand copied manuscripts are there still differences in accounts of events, such as when Jesus died in relation to the timing of the Passover meal or what garments were found in the tomb after the resurrection?   Also, could some of those "lost Christianities" which competed with what Mr. Ehrman refers to as the prevailing "proto-orthox" views have failed the test of time simply because they were wrong?  And if history is suspect anytime it is "written by the winners," schould we also be inclined to doubt the holocaust or the failure of Soviet Communism?  Perhaps Mr. Ehrman thinks that slavery got a "bad rap" from an historical perspective.  Maybe he will start rooting for the Chicago Cubs.  One can only wonder.  In defense of Mr. Ehrman, I will say that his writing style is engaging and lively, and not totally without fact.  But he does give away his agenda at times, which makes me question his credibility. While he is no Dan Brown, who still stands behind falsehoods to bring Jesus "down to our level," Mr. Ehrman seems to have an agenda he doesn't wish to share with us in his book.  It is not uncommon for secular Bible scholars to attack the KJV simply to shake the foundation of the "religious right."  After hearing Mr. Ehrman interviewed on NPR, that is exactly what I think he's doing.  It is expected that a growning number of "secular fundamentalists" will applaud anything that contradicts the New Testament, rejoicing in not having a God looking over their shoulders and telling them who they can and can't sleep with 
 This book is a collection of SOME of the works of William Howard Taft but the title is quite misleading, as it does NOT include State of the Union Addresses.  Also the author has not taken the time or effort to provide the reader / researcher with an INDEX, which, of course, means that one has to read the entire collection to find references to a particular subject matter.  In short,  this book is merely a reprinting of some of Taft's speeches and addresses and nothing more 
 I was very excited about this book before I started to read it.  Polk appeared to have flawless credentials...surely someone with so much relevent experience would produce an outstanding book on Iraq.  Unfortunately it became clear very early on in this book that my expectations were not to be met.  Let's start witht the obvious.  The subtitle of this book begins as "the whole sweep of Iraqi history..."  The book is 213 pages and even that can be deceiving...physically, the book is very small and the typesetting appears larger than average.  To be sure, no single book could adequately present the whole sweep of Iraqi history, but of all the Iraqi history books I have read or referenced, this book does the poorest job of all in terms of presenting an overview of the country.  I would recommend Anderson and Stansfield's book as an example of one of the best books in this area.  The way Polk has the book organized, it would be reasonable to have high hopes.  There are six chapters: Ancient Iraq, Islamic Iraq, British Iraq, Revolutionary Iraq, American Iraq, and Whose Iraq?  He appears to have the important bases covered, but within these chapters lies a remarkably weak and half-hearted presentation of Iraq's history, at least at the governmental level.  Another somewhat related criticism would be that there are next to no cited sources in the entire book.  From an academic standpoint, this is baffling.  His experience in the field notwithstanding, it is unacceptable to produce what is to be a serious history book and then provide no sources or bibliography.  The key here is to recognize that at its heart, this book is not an attepmt to provide a history of Iraq, but merely an outlet for criticizing the way the U.S. (particularly Bush) has handled Iraq.  Onto that criticism:  Polk is one of those authors that rightly and (mostly) accurately points out all of the bad things the U.S. has done when it comes to Iraq.  From a moral or humanitarian perspective, of course it's wrong to give support to someone like Hussein.  I think most people would agree with that.  What baffles me is that someone could so passionately point out all these bad things and then be so opposed to a war that ultimately removed a regime who surived up to that point because of what the U.S. had done.  Even though it was not the reason given, the U.S. had accumulated quite a large moral debt to Iraq.  In short, we owed it to Iraqis to get rid of Saddam.  Further explanations of this type of thinking can be found in Feldman's "What we owe Iraq," and Cushman's "A Matter of Principle."  My last main complaint about this book is that for all the criticizing and lamenting about U.S. intentions and mistakes (and believe me, these are all warranted), Polk offers no real ideas for what to do to help Iraqis build a better future, and more importantly, he never even touches on the topic of what kind of life these people would have endured if Hussein was still in power today.  I think it's important and necessary to call the U.S. on its mistakes, but at the end of the day, the U.S. actually helped get rid of a dictator this time.  And even though we owe this to a lot of other countries, I can only be glad that humanitarian and security interests were aligned in this case, and that for all the other problems, there is at least a chance for democracy and a better life in Iraq.  That chance certainly did not exist under Hussein.  The biggest let down here is that it is important for people to understand Iraq, but this book I believe, is doing more harm than good.  If you've done a fair amount of reading on Iraq, this will be clear so that's not the danger here.  What would be an absolute tragedy here would be for someone with no prior experience to pick up this book and then think they have a real understanding of Iraq after reading it.  These are the types of books that make my job as a professor harder than it should be because I have to spend so much time in order to defuse all numbers of students who read material like this and base their opinions and judgements from it.  While not nearly as damaging to the process of education and understanding as Michael Moore or Sean Hannity, it is much more disappointing because Polk has the education and experience needed to produce stellar work.  Framed in those terms, this book is largely a failure 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 The writing needs some work.  This album probably won't see significant rotation in my playlist 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 I read this book as a part of a Chicano Literature course during my undergrad studies.  While I found the first 140 or so pages okay, I found the overall story a bit boring (educational, but boring).  Lest you think I am being unfair, let me note that the story did pick up again at the end and I do not recall ever having fallen asleep while reading it. (2 stars so far)  I really liked the use of language in creating the voice of the narrator.  It gave me the feeling that I was sitting with an elder aunt or grandmother who was telling the story to me.  (Make it 3 stars, bordering on 4).  So, why the 1 star?  Mainly because I did not like what I interpreted to be a thinly disguised attack on a straw man version of Catholicism and I can't rate it a zero.  I found many of the incidents in the story and especially the commentary of the narrator to be very critical of Catholicism.  I find it unfortunate that, like most critics of Catholicism, Castillo critizes/attacks a straw man version of Catholicism rather than the real thing.  In an interview the author was asked about fact checking in works of fiction (specifically in her book "Massacre of the Dreamers"), Castillo answered:  "No. There isn't any point in it. It's your opinion. It's your reflection, your reaction, your own opinion. When you write a critical -- and this isn't personal essays, these are critical essays -- then you have to prove ever single thing you say."  Maybe that's why she chose to attack a straw man rather than the real thing 
 This product is aweful.  The gear strips, the pad is staionary while the disk spins and this leads to circular scratches on the disk. Compared to the Disk Washer product that I had used for 15 years, this product is junk.   AVOID IT 
 Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman.  The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging 
 DBI gives a pleasant overlook of the branding process illustrated with various examples. It is however not a guidline to creating/building/maintaining a brand, so in this the title is misleading.  Warning: There are tons of compairable books around of equal or better quality. Only for those you don't have to fork out +/- $99,- to buy it second hand here!!! The book is not antique, the book not a life altering experience and the content is not worth more than $20,- second hand, so beware not to be tricked into paying quadruple the price it is really worth 
 This would have made an interesting 20 page short story, but adding a couple hundred pages of character development and plot is just a waste of time. The characters are shallow and the storyline unbelievable. What university on earth would leave this thing alone with one associate professor for months on end? And then there is the clever escape from the moving car while being kidnapped - give me a break. Simply awful 
 Brigitte Lin, Maggie Cheung and Donnie Yen are amazing.  I was excited to see a movie that combined their talents, but "Dragon Inn" was a big disappointment.  The plot was too absurd for my liking, the characters felt a little two-dimensional and the fight scenes were only a fraction of what they could have been.  However, some people really like this movie a lot.  My recommendation would be to rent it first.    
 Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look act so dumb by English Dubb. ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots, and bulls though 
 Good luck on finding mineral sites using this guide.  While the minerals may be in the areas indicated, the maps are so crude that the likelihood of your finding the sites is very poor.  I have tried using the guide for several years with almost no success 
 This book was full of inaccuracies.  It was written from a very Protestant view point, one of which colors their reporting of history.  This is not a true history text, but a work of fiction!  As a homeschool mom I was horrified to see what lies were told in this book.  I had thought about selling it, but decided against it because how could I let other homeschool parents teach their children from this book when it has outright lies and personal opinion all over it.  Do not waste your time or money on this.  The idea is a terrific one, but in the end it is a very jaded presentation of history.   
 Don't let the cover fool you, this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like "Groove", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway. Now I wouldn't call this bad, it had it's good parts, just not many. 
 I was counting on a THREE HOUR working battery. After all, that's what it says it gives you.  So far all I get from it, after more than a month of use, is two hour, max.. 
 Despite the talented cast this is perhaps the most ridiculous film ever.A goofy hippy copy laughs along the way trying to catch an eleven murder serial killer.This writer did Moonstruck, but this is Moonstink.Seeing Rod Steiger with this material is a tragedy.The case is a joke, the characters are impossibly lame, and the dialogue would gag a collie.This film is worth seeing only to gain appreciatiation for the value of screenwriters.No amount of acting talent can lift this turkey out of the Bankok privey.I just watched this film and at the conclusion I just sat there with my mouth open not believeing how bad the film was.Saradon, Keitel,KLine, Steiger, and Rickman....will try and forget this dog their entire lives. I cannot imagaine how any studio or distributing company let this turkey reach the public.Have I gotten the point accross that the film is weak....I hope so.If I could give it zero stars or even better, minus eleven stars, I would 
 Petra Haden, OK I thought this would be some polite folk jazz record to break her into the biz, but this is just a PoP record!! It sounds like any female alternative singers CD, and is in the field of mood music. I know Bill Frisell likes to break the rules, and some say "what rules", but why does he not play -Free music, Drum n Bass, contemporary classical music- enc? Bill is a talented musician, but this is less than a bright moment. 
 If there were a list of the worst books ever written, this one would be on top of the list.   What bothered me the most was the fact that the author portrayed the mother as loving her children with all her heart, but when this "mother," and I use the term loosely, saw her husband drowning, she jumped in the water to drown along with him because the thought of living without him was too much to bear. With all those children???? She could have been saved along with her children, but she cared so little about them, she committed suicide and left them in the care of Edwina, her eldest daughter. Tell me what mother would do this to her children?  To add insult to injury, those children were so annoying, I didn't care what happened to them. I wanted to throw myself in the ocean after reading this poor excuse for a book.   I wrote a letter to Ms Steel to let her know how much I despised this book, but she never replied, not that I thought she would. Save your money and buy anything but this book. 
 In 1977 I was eight and far too young to appreciate this slice of ubitquitous AOR southern Californian pop-rock. Now, at 38, I should be old enough. Yet this still leaves me cold. It's only a matter of taste, and clearly millions disagree with me, but this music doesn't make me FEEL anything except tedium. There is one exception: Go Your Own Way is undeniably a decent song. And that great bass riff on The Chain DOES still sound great and brings back happy memories of watching Grand Prixs on tv when I was a kid (it was the theme music in the UK).  Otherwise though, to me, this is a bunch of coked-out, self-satisfied musicians coasting on automatic, who fully understand that safe, bland songs like these have the potential to bring in pots of cash. There's nothing remotely ambitious about these songs: they're custom-made for undemanding ears who want some light background entertainment while driving to work or washing the dishes. There's nothing wrong with that in itself - there's a demand for undemanding music and we all want a bit of background diversion from time to time. And that's about all that can be said for it, really.   Fleetwood Mac got the last laugh. They could have churned out these songs in their sleep, yet they made them multi-millionaires. Good for them. Being successful has rarely had much to  do with creating interesting music.  
 After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price).  
 This "atlas" contains only black and white sketch maps, which give no indication of actual geographical and topological conditions.  It has a fairly decent discussion of the history connected with each map, but this is necessarily short. This book should cost about 5 times less than it does, if it were about $7.00 it might be worth buying.  
 this is strictly a dvd production not good for the big screen. a very mediocre screenplay originated from a meidocre novel by one of the once-upon-a-time greatest novelists. sam elliot was a very bad casting choice, he's way too old for this action movie, he looked so tired to move around in almost all the locations. and the on and on flash-backs were the worst and the oldest directing and editing technique to be used in this bad movie. the cia and the cia operatives also looked so lame, so stupid and so unconvincing, they're just a bunch of wimps. the connection between cia and that bosnian mass murderer was also too contrite to be convinced easily. a brainless screenplay worse than the original bad novel. 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 I agree with all the other reviewers .. nice quality recording for its time considering it was in the vaults for decades ..great playing  from all concerned(except the  cursed Drummer) , I cannot imagine what poor Jerry Gemmot went through with THAT DRUMMER .. he should have been  dismissed immediately ..or shot ..it would have sounded better without him .. Gawd' awful .. spoils the whole dang thing .. any way .. I cannot listen to this anymore without getting uncomfortable , so it's back to Soul Of A Man , Re-Kooperation ,  Live Adventures , Super Session , and Kooper Sessions with Shuggie  
 As a child I remember finding this magazine at my doctor's office and reading it because it was the only thing available. It has not changed much. There are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content. This Magazine will neither stretch your child's mind nor keep him entertained. It only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen. In the coming era of global connection, children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them. Only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia 
 adam sandler is a very funny commedian.  His movies are hilarious and his album, "they're Gonna Laugh at You is one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life.  "What's Your Name", however, is just not  funny.  I think sandler has always wanted to be a musician and he tries to  be one on this album moreso than a commedian.  "the Lonesome  Kicker" is kind of funny and 'The Goat song" is absolutely  hilarious, but the rest of the album is just plain boring.  It's not funny  and the songs aren't good enough musically to listen to despite the lack of  humor.  When Sandler does skits no one can touch him in the funny  department and when he mixes one or two songs in with the skits they work  very well, but I'm sorry, he's just not good enough a musician to make a cd  with nothing, but songs on it, especially when the words aren't funny 
 Reading this book is a waste of time; a review book cannot teach you how to answer multiple choice or essay questions as well as a teacher.  I found the multiple choice questions on the exam to be much more difficult than the practice questions in the book.  And by the way, on the back of the book it says thay it's a guide for the AP Lit exam instead of the AP Language exam 
 I expected a book called "weddings for grownups" to be about weddings for people who realize that having a meaningful gathering of one's friends and family is more important than the physical trappings of the celebration.  Apparently the author believes it is "grown-up" to have fancy decorating ideas like gold-trimmed art deco cakes and elegant thousand dollar flower arrangements.  Very focused on high-end style.  If that's your thing, and you have the budget to support it, you will love this book 
 The main issue is the controls. We are having a hard time getting this thing to fly well and the idea of pulling down to go down is weird to us pilot types. It tends to just nose dive regardless. We will give it another go at the park tomorrow but so far all it does is crash. That it's still in one piece is amazing 
 My first viewing of Fahrenheit 451 since its initial release in 1966 was last night via DVD.  Any casual film fan who watches will fall to sleep very fast. Based on the novel by Ray Bradbury, the clever idea of the future sets the stage for an interesting movie. The vehicle that the 451 unit drives is one of the most unusual devices science fiction will ever see.  The plot, the sound and the characters are all completely uninteresting, minus Montag, whom Oskar Werner plays very well.  The moment with the lady with the hidden library was probably one of the silliest examples of what books meant to some. FAHRENHEIT 451 may be considered a classic to some, but without a remake quick, this is a boring artifact to science fiction theater. In the future, the government outlaws books and promotes people to do nothing but watch TV and take drugs. Miserable firefighter Montag, set for a promotion in the 451 book burning unit, takes up the suggestion from a fellow monorail passenger to read a book. His life then goes upside-down from there. Skip the movie and read the book instead 
 This is a sad and strange tale of a woman who leaves an oppressive Amish family and community for a morbidly obese, thrice divorced, unemployable man who is 25 years her senior. I was especially disturbed when upon escaping in his van, this knight in shining armor hands her an electric razor and tells her she must shave her legs if she's going to be his wife! The author is young, and still very naive about the world. I'd be interested in reading a followup story ten years down the road when, hopefully, she'll have developed keener analytical skills. 
 I bought this dvd because of the wonderfull Eva Mendes but i didn't know about the plot...what a surprise I think there is nothing funny in this movie and sometimes bad taste is at his best. The situation of the siamese twins is far to be a lot of fun and is disturbing somewhere. Sometimes it looks good and there is a little something.photography and music are very good. not more than 2 stars 
 This book is the only detailed guide to the Ventana wilderness.  It is very difficult to follow and you definitely sense that it has not been updated since 1987.  The topo maps in back are hard to read and you constantly have to flip back and forth to see where you are going.  I give it a 4 because it is the only book out there, but in terms of usability it is a 1. My advice:  buy the book and call the ranger station to get the skinny before heading out into the wilderness.  Also, I will definitely refrain from pointing out my favorite hiking destination...it is a jewel 
 Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist.  He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution.   His retelling of the Divine Comedy, which appears to be based on earlier translations, is reasonably accurate and readable.  The problem comes with his notes.  They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive.  Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications.  This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as "that most heinous of sins".   And there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks. This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally of tune with Dante, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.  There are many superior translations out there.  Mandelbaum's is excellent and has good notes.  Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all.  What the Modern Library had in mind when commissioning this translation, which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry, remains a mystery. 
 This is without a doubt the worste game I have ever purchased. It is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat.  They could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from. As it is right now it's just a really, really, really, crappy version of Zelda: Orcarina of Time.  If you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it 
  I would love to be able to ask Joe Mitchell why in the devil he succumbed to this worthless little wastrel and beggar, Joe Gould. It's been impossible for me to put down any of  Mr. Mitchell's other writings; what marvelous learning experiences they've been. However, for the life of me, I couldn't find one redeeming virtue about a pompous, lying little cock-of-the-walk like Joe Gould.  He left absolutely nothing behind in his wake other than decades of panhandling, fabricating, and babbling---almost exclusively about himself. And, my Gawd, he was a bore; maybe, that's what Harvard taught him, the art of crashing boredom. There was nothing secret about Joe Gould that is worth a reader's expending a single bat of an eyelash. Honestly, I feel Joe Mitchell felt he had to write---something, anything---because this  useless old fool had succored Mitchell into listening to sooo many hours of his incoherent verbal diarrea.   
 Lots of style, very little content.  Maybe she's asking the fundamental questions about life and death, but it sounds to me more like self-indulgent rambling posing as philosophy.  I always wonder, too, at the arrogance of people who, even though most of the people on earth are neither Jewish nor Christian, assume that Jews and Christians have all the answers to fundamental questions about existence.  And, when you consider that all through history, religions of all sorts have caused more problems than they've solved, why would anyone look to religion for answers to serious questions anyway? 
 I paid 50 bucks for a pen that is already leaking on its third day of use. The craftsmanship is shoddy. The packaging itself has nicks on it. The pen is leaking from the silver ring above the first one. I've had to use scotch tape on it so that it doesn't keep staining my fingers. The box says made in China, and well quite frankly, the product seems to be exactly that, made in China.  I always thought Cross was suppose to be a good brand of pens, but I now know they aren't. The problem for me is I ordered 3 of these pens and one ball point one all at the same time so I could give a few of them away as gifts. What am I going to do now? This bites 
 I have never read a Walter Mosely book an frankly had no desire to do so.  This month's book club member chose this book; since it is the 10th book in a series, it clearly was a poor choice.  Anyway, I spent yesterday listening to this book on tape.  It was literally unbearable.  Why exactly is this book set in the 60's?  From all the reviews, there clearly is a group of people living in the past and this is sad.  I couldn't get anything out of this book other than the fact that Feather had a blood disease and Easy needed money to send her to Switzerland for treatment.  It took Easy so long, isn't it likely that Feather is dead by now?  The book was cheesy, poorly written and simply bordered on the ridiculous.  The book also left many key plot issues unresolved. I can't imagine someone choosing to read this series voluntarily 
 The best word I could come up with to describe this book is...blah. There are so many loose pieces that are never tied together.  I would not recommend bothering with this book.  
 If I hear that phrase one more time I'm going to scream! The character of Elayna says it way to often!  But considering she acts like a snotty high school girl I suppose it's appropriate. I expected much more from Cathy Hanauer.  This is the first book I've read of hers and I am accutely disapointed.  The character behaves like a spoiled brat, ignoring the potential danger that her daughter may be in and drolling over a young man instead of working on her marriage. It's a story that's been told a hundred times before and Cathy Hanauer didn't add anything new.  The writing was fine but the story line was a yawn 
 Both 100' spools of this wire came in TWO pieces.I discovered that I'd have to splice it halfway through a difficult install. URHHHH!!!! Avoid these problems by buying other vendor's products 
  Too bad I can not give Turbulence no stars.  This movie is just filled with way too many things that just stretch even the most liberal imaginations well past the limits of reality!  The whole movie just does not work.  The FBI agents are too easily overcome and out smarted by a self professed genius serial killer whose one dimensional actions make his IQ seem incredibly average to me.  Rather than being very smart the serial killer seemed a self absorbed slob who is overly impressed with his own lame exploits.  The rest of the airplane passengers seem like fawns or sheep.  Logic suggests when transporting a dangerous horde of hardened criminals the crew would be a select group of individuals hand picked for their skill at dealing with a plane full of diseased brilliant minded malefactors.  The plot is obviously concocted to introduce fawn like ladies and foppish men into the mix so the audience has a heightened thrill factor.  Problem is the other non-law enforcement passengers seem inserted into the plot for no good reason other than their role as pawns to be used by the serial killer to drag an otherwise painfully predictable lifeless story along to its all too formulaic end.  Also the Christmas lights festooned all over the plane when you are carrying hardcore prisoners is so over the top that you must wonder what the heck were the writers thinking.  Most hardcore prisoners are quite intelligent and could certainly turn all those dangling Christmas lights to their advantage in some vile criminal way.  No FBI agent or corrections officer  worth his or her salt would let a prisoner set foot in a plane that had so many opportunities for prisoners to escape their direct care custody and control.  Also the most glaring flaw in Turbulence occurs when even the most basic tenants of maintaining care custody and control of violent malignant inmates were overlooked again and again.  The Plane skimming over buildings through rooftops into structures was just plain stupid.  While most tall buildings roof top garden rooms and associated elements are lightly constructed they must stand up to high winds.  Add that buildings the plane was scraping had mechanical equipment towers where strong girders and supports reside that should have broken the plane up or at least damaged it more than was shown.  It is like the writers of Turbulence were a bunch of college drama students drunk and totally detached from reality got challenged to come up with a disaster thriller plot.  Drama for drama's sake without any plausible relationship to reality is not thrilling or action adventure it is just disjointed stupid garbage.  Turbulence is just garbage to watch when you have time to waste.  If you want real suspense on a plane get Air Force One.  Turbulence is an invitation to take a round trip to and from Palooka-Ville, the plane has plenty of seats available but who cares!. This Turbulence is just a bumpy ride that leaves you feeling sick.  I can think of better ways to spend time. 
 Wood/water is without a shadow of a doubt the worst record i have ever picked up for a start the lead vocalist seems to be whinging like something you would hear on a dashboard confessional or even new found glory album although having said that this album deserves the title 'emo' with the genre been the worst around and anyone who deserves that title has got to be (weak), i've heard all the albums from the promise rings discography excpecting to hear an improvment every time but the only cd i half like is nothing feels good and even that has the repetative sound from this very poor band, you could pick up a guitar and learn to play it in about 2 months and you would be as talanted as the guitarist from this band, i would advise that you try and hear samples of this band to get a slight reflection of how terrible they are. Alot of the bands who have been on jade tree (although it's epitaph in this case) are terrible with the slight exception of Jets to Brazil (later albums included despite non-stop cynical remarks) and j church (probably one of the most under-rated bands around). Wood/water also trys to sink into the deep world of meaningful lyrics but just ends up drowning, think i might have proven my point there worst record ever made along with any manufactured pop music/pop music and anything you would hear coming from an lift (elevator) or department store, it's not that i'm cynical when it comes to the promise ring it's just they really are a terrible pretentious band with every song having the same endless drone to it 
 This is the first in the Pennsylvania-Dutch murder series, and one can only hope that the series improves with practice.  By the time I was one-third of the way through, I'd slogged through enough whining about how the main character had been deprived of all the normal adolescent fun (proms, etc.) while her much-younger sister got all the experience (and then ran off and married outside the community) that I was ready to scream as loudly as the author has the characters hollering.  To call the dialogue ham-handed is to give it more credit than it deserves.  And the main character doesn't solve the murder -- the murderer conveniently attacks her and then confesses, outlining all of the steps in the murder -- no brainpower needed at all.  Why bother 
 I wanted to like this book. However, I found the writing very droll. I just couldn't feel the emotion, the ideals, the "rapture" of the subject matter. Instead, the book is bogged down in endless and pointless biographical details...this person did this, and then this, and so on. Maybe I'm not giving it the benefit of the doubt, but there are other books on transhumanism I found far more interesting, informative, and readable 
 The book started out fairly well, but the amateurish writing really did start to get to me after awhile. The murders the story hinges around get dull and tiresome, and I actually began rooting for the unidentified killer to do away with Kate Paine, the undeveloped and boring heroine of the book. When  finally learned who the culprit was, I had totally lost interest and felt that the author just pulled it out of a hat without any reason or logic. And there is nothing more annoying in books than the killer explaining to the victim (who is tied up and forced to listen to the obligatory rantings) all the reasons he has done such terrible deeds. For a better story, read "The Firm" by John Grisham, or "The Job" by Douglas Kennedy 
 While I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, the second was pure agony. I actually started to skim through most of the pages until I reached the end.  It is dense with detail; almost too dense. For instance, Finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire. His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a "quick, easy read". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers). 
 Uh, the author is a lawyer, which means her first obligation is to uphold the law. This means gathering up the illegal aliens and getting them out of the country, quickly. Instead, this "lawyer" decides that it's more important to figure out how to screw what remains of middle-class America in order to get "rights" and such for the criminals. Nice 
 I am a huge Tananarive Due fan---My Soul to Keep is one of my favorite books and The Living Blood is not far behind.  So it pains me to say just how disappointed I was with Joplin's Ghost.  It is clear that Ms. Due has given up her true voice to keep up with urban drivel that has, for some unknown reason, become so popular as of late.  Joplin's is an easy read--which is not a good thing, as it lacks the dimension and coplexity of her previous works.  The Joplin piece was interesting but the rest of the story tries to be hip and falls way short of the mark. I hope that Ms. Due finds her way back to her voice. 
 I don't mind that the original bleeped-out words are still bleeped on the DVDs... that's how the show was. (For example, I think the Viva La Bam DVDs would, for the most part, be funnier with the original tv bleeps.)  I don't mind that the original blacked-out and pixelated views are there... that's how the show was (and trust me, we're better for it).  With that being said, here's the real problem -- this is not presented in an as-aired episode format. Of course I should have realized that "volume" does not mean "season", but "season" is what everyone expects from a tv show DVD. That's how every other tv show is realeased; even the Wildboyz and Viva la Bam DVDs are presented in episode format.  This box set lacks because the bits are somehow funnier when viewed in context of the original episode. The recurring themes within the episodes are funnier. It's also much more convenient to sit down and watch an episode or two whenever you want. Instead, it all gets lost in the 2-hour marathon format of each "volume". Additionally, as many reviewers have mentioned, many of the classic bits are absent from this set.  Bottom line is, before you purchase this set, realize that many of the bits you remember may be missing. Also realize that each "volume" is a marathon of strung-together bits, and you will not see the actual episodes.  I suggest that die-hard Jackass fans actually not buy this set, because I think you will be more frustrated and upset in the end. Because of the "volume" format, you will probably only watch each disc once, then quickly retire it to the shelf. I regret that someone spent some good money buying this as a gift for me. I would gladly return it for only half it's original price if I could 
 This was the most useless book I have ever read on being a parent.  The author goes on and on about how painful and excruciating breastfeeding is, and how all "girlfriends" can relate to this pain if they are breastfeeding.  Huh??  If she had read any books on breastfeeding at all or gotten some basic advice from a lactation consultant, she would realize that her baby was latched on incorrectly and would have corrected the problem.  Also, she talks about girlfriends hiding from their husbands in the house so that they can breastfeed?  What?!?!  This book just infuriated me, it was so shallow and pointless, I feel like the author lives in a world all her own, inhabited by stepford wife-like "girlfriends" who struggle incessantly with mothering a new baby and have to hide everything from their dumb husbands who are completely incompetent.  How insulting!!  Don't waste your time or money on this garbage 
 I count myself, perhaps presumptiuous, as an intelligent person, and I have managed to make an A in Biochemistry using this text; BUT it has everything to do with my ability to see the mistakes and editing errors in this edition!!  From mixing up abribiations to flip-flopping ratios this text is full of poor editing mistakes.  Not to mention the website connection is more confusing and limited.  It takes more time to figure out the wierd 5 graders level of programing that defines their "living graphs" than it takes to simply memorize word for word the page the equations come from in the text (if the equations are correct in the text in the first place!)  I am befuddled by the overwelmingly possitive reviews this second rate text has.  Did I some how get my hands on a first run of this text that should have been recalled like a lemon?  Every chaptor I take my text to my TA in the course and get an error clarified and she and I stand amazed at the amount of confusing errors in this text. I have since aquired a Voet text and look forward to reading it.       As a side note: the "study guide" to this text that I bought is more acuratly a "confuse you guide" written by monkeys who took on female human names.  They add things up incorrectly for God's sake!  Even though it will cost me more money I hope to God that my second semester of Biochem uses a different text book 
 Whoever thinks this "marriage" of opera and pop was a good idea is the same guy that thinks John Tesh is a great composer.  People have simply stopped listening seriously to music, and it is a real shame.  This recording is for the scrap heap.  The accompaniment is cheesier than a big wedge of provolone.  There isn't a single live musician in the studio with this young lady.  The people who think this is good music are the same ones that aren't bothered by the prospect of a canned sound track in a Broadway show or the "pop stylings" of Charlotte Church.  Go out and find some REAL MUSIC, people!  It's there if you look.  As the great American composer Charles Ives wrote: "Open your ears!&quot 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 This remote is unreliable junk... well... let me rephrase... the remote itself is fine but the software that controls it is absolute garbage which causes the remote to completely freeze up at least once a day.  If you are the kind of person that turns on the computer for an hour... uses the remote, and shuts off you'll probably never have a problem.  But users of PVR software keep their machines up and running 24x7.  I have this piece of work freezing up on me at least once a day.  After researching further, I found that the program on the computer that controls the remote goes into an infinite loop state where it uses 100% of the processor.  The only way to re-initialize the remote is by restarting the computer but if your computer is currently recording something you'll end up corrupting the show you are recording.  After research I found many others on the web with the same issue.    I'm sure someone will read this and say "load the new drivers idiot!"... believe me, I'm up-to-date with the most current drivers as of the date of this review (Feb/2007).  Streamzap acknowledged the problem on prior versions of the driver but it still exists to this day.  Just search the internet and see.  [...] You can take my word for it, or you can take your chances.  If Streamzap had replied to even ONE of the multiple emails I sent asking for help I would have been happy to work with them.  But I think they know the problem is out there and they don't want to address the problem.  They can see the numerous postings all over the internet from other people like me with the same issue 
 these sheets feel like sandpaper....they didnt fit my pillowtop either, thankfully, so i had to return the 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 Don't waste your money!! I would give it a zero if I could 
    Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I bought this book with the hopes that it would help me lose the last few stubborn pounds.  I'll admit that some of the author's recommendations seemed a little radical, but I was willing to give it a try. So I faithfully gave up caffeine, ate the prescibed foods and avoided sugar, wheat, etc. etc. in preparation for the one day fast.  I can honestly say that the one day fast was one of the WORST experiences of my life. I was starving, miserable, exhausted, cranky, and did have a revalation - but not the one the author promised.  I realized once and for all that to lose weight, you simply need to eat enough good food to give you energy and exercise more often - not eat cups of raw parsley, brussel sprouts, cabbage, and nutritional yeast(which is revolting).  I did lose 1.5 pounds during the fast, which I gained back in exactly one day - clearly just water weight. The author cautions against the dangers of EVERYTHING: Saran wrap, microwaves, teflon, unorganic spinach, plastic containers, etc. etc. If you would like to give up any pleasure that enjoying a good dinner with friends might give you, then by all means follow this plan. Otherwise, don't be fooled by quick fixes - they just don't work 
 It's summer, and my reading matter always lightens up significantly! I spotted this book at the library and figured, why not!  I know, I said never again for Danielle Steel, but the plot interested me.  How bad could it be, right?    Well, there's good news and bad news.  The good news is that the plot is different for DS, and held my interest enough so that, unlike Impossible, I actually finished it in one day.  The bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing.  The repetition is maddening. When reading becomes a chore, and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything, it's time to start some serious editing.    Here are some suggested areas of improvement:  - Shorten up the paragraphs.  They should not exceed a page! - Try spending a little more time developing the characters.  I couldn't "see" Sarah - when I read, I want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages, I never had a clear vision of the main character - Pay attention to style. Every time she spelled out 30,000, I wanted to pull my hair out.  Small thing, but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.  As I've written before, DS needs a good editor. This book could have been one of her best to date.  
 This grater is not a convenience, it's more of a punishment.  I have tried it for hash browns, cheese, chocolate, etc.  I thought at first I was using it incorrectly, but then realized, there really is no wrong way of using this.  Everytime I have used it it has caused me so much pain in my hands that I would rather do it the old fashioned way and just grate the cheese manually.  My fingers and hands ache so bad that I can't even hold a pencil after using this gadget.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Unfortunately, you have to rate this with 1 being the lowest star, but in reality I give it NO STARS! 
 I wanted a new computer, so a couple months ago I ordered an HP computer that happened to have Vista on it.  I thought, "oh great, I'll get the newest OS as well"... major mistake.  1. Didn't work with my perhipherals, including my scanner and an HP PRINTER.  For god's sake, the COMPUTER'S AN HP, why won't it work with an HP printer!?  If they knew the drivers for perhipherals weren't ready, why the did they release the OS and force us to buy it?  2. Annoying security feautres, constantly asking permissions to install software.  Just like the Apple ads-- a total joke.  3. After struggling with the damn thing for 2 days, I decided to try to install old trusty xp on it... $200 later, guess what?  You CANT INSTALL an earlier operating system!  Booting from the CD doesn't work either, you get the blue screen of death.  Maybe some tech geek can do it, but I'm done wasting time with this thing.  4. All that agony, for what?  The "fancy" interface?  Who cares what it looks like, I just want to use my damn scanner!  I'm sure all those slick effects suck up RAM and resources, for what functional purpose?  Just to look more like mac?  5. ... Speaking of which, I am now switching to.  Goodbye windows, after 15 years of struggling with your crappy software, I'm done 
 Too much like reading a police report, actually a thousand police reports.  See Killing Pablo if you want a good feel for how interesting this story COULD be if it was told well.. 
 I have to confess I didn't get very far with this one. If you have to read this for a course, I'm very sorry.  I'm not an academic, but I do I read a lot of philosophy. I'll put a lot of energy into a complex text, but I prefer to invest it with works that will enlighten, not confuse.   On the clarity-precision scale, I would push Levinas right past "dense" or "challenging" and put it somewhere between "turgid" and "impenetrable." (His apologists decry the inability of human language to convey Levinas' sophisticated thoughts. Maybe so, but perhaps the apology says more about his thoughts than it does about human language.)  In any case, it will take you a long time to genuinely read this book. If you're looking for truth (as opposed to a passing grade in a required course), you would be better served by spending 3 hours contemplating and reasoning to your own working definition of the following words:  --- "totality" --- "infinity" --- "other"  Then spend 3 hours contemplating and reasoning to your own understanding of how the three are interrelated.  Then get a decent translation of Aristotle's Metaphysics. (I like the McKeon translation, but there are certainly newer, hipper ones.) Then read Aristotle instead of Levinas. If you find the idea of reading a Dead White Guy repugnant, spend the time watching water move over rocks. Either choice will provide you more wisdom than you could get from a lifetime studying An Essay on Exteriority 
 I worship Lou Reed as a god, but this album ranks among the dumbest things I've ever heard in my entire life. I do wish I could confront him and just ask what exactly he thinks he is doing - maybe that would serve to explain this pap. Mediocre, dirge-like tunes offset by hideously pretentious lyrics and now and then disturbingly hammy readings by notable actors. Avoid it like the plauge 
 Sloppy and convuluted writing probably due to sloppy and convuluted thinking on the part of the translator.   
 I didn't like this book.  It didn't knock my socks off 
 I Purchased this to replace my husband's favorite keyfob from American Eagle, which was almost identical (and lasted ten years, incidentally). This one fell apart after two months. Time for a trip to the local leathersmith.. 
 I was very disappointed in this book - I felt I could have written it myself, using platitudes and the type of jargon one finds in a women's magazine article.  I would have preferred more concrete advice, instead of touchy-feely pseudo-psychology.  I didn't learn a thing I didn't already know 
 I wonder if Judith Miller's knowledge of Islam included actually learning the 99 names for God, which define the essence of God for Muslims.  If she had, I also wonder why it didn't give her reason to pause and then share the true core essence of this faith.  I also lived a number of years in the Middle East, not as a professional, but as the American daughter of a father who worked there.  I went to a local school, took public transportation, went to the markets, LEARNED ARABIC... in a nutshell, learned WHO the people are and WHAT they believe. Judith Miller's book betrays ANY knowledge of this sort.  It's easy to become blocked by the smog and dirt of Cairo and donkeys in the streets (so shocking for Americans).  She sounds like a tourist in her descriptions of the people and culture - and after so many years there.  Reminds me of so many U.S. Embassy personnel I met - shrouded by the Embassy and cultural center walls and private chauffeurs.  What a shame - she just didn't get it.  If anyone wants to learn more about the Middle East, don't limit yourself to this book - you'll be doing yourself a disservice 
 This is the second book I have decided to review. I have decided to do so inorder that others may avoid my mistake. The book is banal. It goes on and on, creating category after category of needless taxonomies. Nothing even slightly new or interesting. Additionally it suffer the problem of all "internet" books. It was hoplessly outdated by the ime it hit thw shelves. Someone exceptionaly tiresome wrote a phd thesis, invented jargon and then decided to turn it into a book.  
 Fantastic!!!  As told by one of the finest drummers in the world.  A first hand account of the hardships of starting out, their trials and tribulations, and becoming one of the most successful bands in history.  A must see for any Police fan.  AAAA+++ 
 Patterson claims in this text that claims of racism in America are overinflated and that African Americans are doing quite well. While this Harvard sociologist may be doing quite well he has forgotten about the  "masses". Patterson argues not only for integration and  assimilation, but miscegenation. Is this his idea of "if you can't  beat them become them" 
 The original Julie and Romeo was delightful. This book was utter nonsense.  A great disapointment. Finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along. It Didn't 
 Hi.  I bought this product expect a bright laser because of other reviews.  Not only was this laser bright, it hurt my eyes to look at the dot it made!  How ever, this laser ran out of batteries after 3 days of use and a week later it broke!  Some of the wiring inside it has gone faulting and I have to tilt it a direction to get it to work.  Not only that but from 6 feet away the dot is the size of an apple!!! -unhappy customer.  *Good shipping speed though  and I would be glad to buy a better product from the seller 
 it really deserves a 0 rating -- non- skid surface is a joke -- it is slick as glass -- tripod dog could not get any traction with single hind leg -- golden slipped off side and hurt her leg -- learn from my mistake -- there is NOTHING positive to say about this product 
 While the author certainly has insights and interesting things to say about the city of Mumbai, his style of writing is nothing short of painful.  Sentences are carelessly constructed.  Topics bounce from one topic to another on every page, sometimes within paragraphs.  Many sentences don't make any sense at all and words are often used incorrectly.    I read this for my book group and found it to be a real struggle.  I found myself irritated with the author from the outset and a bit astonished that this book, that has been promoted so aggressively, did not undergo a much needed edit before going to press.    The author strikes me as young, over-eager, and in great need of settling down and focusing 
 This book leaves alot to be desired. It seems like the author might have been asked to write a book on gemstones and went out to gather a jumble of metaphysical information together and then added gemstone correspondences to them. My advice, stay away and buy something more credible 
 The title of the book would better describe the content if it had been "Random Battles with References to Intelligence." I would not have sold as well, but justly so. From the title you'd expect to learn about how intelligence affects the course of war. Not the case here.  The book focus on haphazzardly selected battles without sufficent greater context to the larger conflict. Covering Midway was a good idea. Not covering the outlook of the Pacific War prior to and after the battle in contrast is disappointing.  The book is at times a stimulant and at others a sleep aid. Keegan's description of the Battle of the Nile lasted four times as long as necessary, but provided enthralling reading occationally. His coverange of the Battle of Midway is pathetic. Far better narritives of this battle have been written, as have descriptions of cryptology's impact on the battle.  No, Mr. Keegan, intelligence (specifically cryptology) didn't win the batte. But cryptology allowed Nimitz a chance to win it. Can intelligence kill the enemy (the base objective of the military commander)? No, but it can tell him which direction to shoot.  If you want to learn about intelligence, don't waste your time on this book.  If you want to read about several random battles involving the English speaking world, don't waste your money on this book 
 There's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame, mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the "In the Zone" album: Imagine "Breathe on Me", "Touch of My Hand" or "Shadow" on constant radio play or running on MTV. And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury. For nothing.  Fortunately for this single, it's got the already legendary "Toxic" and a marvelous vocal mix version of "Everytime" - another star for that.   
 I received this as a Christmas gift and loved the smell of it.  After my second time using it, I broke out in a terrible itchy rash. There is a warning on the bottle that it may cause skin and urinary tract irritation.  Do not buy it if you have even mildly sensitive skin.  The smell is great, but is gone after you get out of the shower. 
 I knew that this concert DVD was an acoustic show so I wasn't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning. But to start the show with Gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much.   Once he did start playing, Gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that I found myself praying for the drums to kick in.   By the time things settle down, the really glaring problem with this DVD comes to the surface. The mix is horrible. The crowd noise drowns out Gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize, he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the "concert experience".  There are high points in the show, but the low points are rock bottom. Comfortably Numb is a song that millions of people know by heart. Two versions are provided on this DVD - from the concert and in the bonus section. Neither of the guest singers (Robert Hewitt and Sir Bob Geldoff) know the words, have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before. Gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience.   The very best thing on this DVD is, oddly enough, in the bonus section. Screamin' Jay Hawkins' I Put a Spell on You, a blues standard performed with Mica Paris and Jools Holland, almost makes the DVD worth buying. Almost.   Watch Jonathan Demme's beautiful treatment of Neil Young: Heart of Gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show. That is the gold standard. 
 You'll never get the straight story about nationalism out of Eric Hobsbawm, who himself appears to try to reconcile his own ethnic identity with the topic.  David Pryce-Jones once noted that in Hobsbawm's own autobiography: "he [Hobsbawm] boasts of a visit to Bir Zeit University on the West Bank to display solidarity with the Palestinians.  Why Palestinian nationalism is valid, and Jewish nationalism invalid, is something else Hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain. Quite crudely, he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves Communist and anti-American, like Cuba or Vietnam, while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not Communist and are pro-American, like Israel" ([...], Jan. 3, 2003).  Such twisted thinking is evident through "Nations and Nationalism," where Mr. Hobsbawm spares no effort, however subtle, to demean nationalism that doesn't conform to his pre-existing prejudices.  In short, when writing about nationalism, Mr. Hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion, communism.  Therefore, unless you are an acolyte of that religion, this book is not worth your time, money or effort to read, and if you *are* a member of that religion, I suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit, perhaps by reading Liah Greenfield's "Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity" or Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities. 
 Crime mob? Give me a break. What kind of crime are you committing in your stilletos? This is ridiculous, IQ lowering, inbred, country, porch monkey, southern crunk krap! Why would you listen to something that you know is going to make you dumber and in the same breath set black people back 100 years. It is insulting for people of the world to see your videos and think all black people are like you. The beats on this album are corny, the lyrics sound like my seven year old wrote them, and the hooks give me the craps. Please stop rapping and pursue a promising career at target 
 i wanted this dvd because i wanted to be scared and i like the ideas of haunted house, honestly this movie was a joke yes it had a story but effects were terrible there was nothing scary about it you could tell that all the bodys and heads and arms that were being hacked off were fake.  i wish i could get my money back id rather go with psyco , motherday,the omen amityvill horroe the excoris 
 well, i had a list of books to pick to read for a project in AP american history, and i picked this book for it being the shortest.  Big mistake.  I could have finished a book twice its size in the same time, for i couldnt  read it for ore than 30 minutes straight because i was so bored.  The  author wasted so much time with description, and the plot was pointless.   Well, i would not recommend this book to anyone in high school 
 Some pages are missed and some pages are the sam 
 I bought this book because it was listed with Ellen Miller's Like Being Killed, a brilliant and complex book about a woman's love affair with heroin, her best friend Susie, and her best friend's duplicitous HIV positive boyfriend. The protagonist herself was brilliant and complex. So naturally, I expected the same thing out of Swimming Sweet Arrow. Man, was I disappointed. This was yet another trashy tale about a pathetic woman's masochistic sex life, pathetic obsession with brutal men, and pathetic quest for attention. Her entire life is a meta-existence: rather than desiring, she desires to be desired. Rather than enjoying, she enjoys being enjoyed. The male characters and the female characters are written by someone who has never met a male or female who didn't exhibit the most common stereotypes; in her world, all men are sensation-craving brutes, and all women are attention-craving doormats. The men want drugs, fun, and sex, and the women whine and cry and enjoy nothing--not the drugs, not the sex, just being a victim due to the attention it provides. This book made me really miserable to be perceived as part of this gender.  
 I foolishly placed my irreplaceable, $200 DVD in this newly-purchased machine as instructed. The result was a disaster!  The machine added visible scratches and made playback WORSE, not better. Suggestion: if you have valuable CDs or DVDs, send them to a professional repair service that uses professional equipment.  Don't mess around with cheap junk 
 I work for a book summary company.  One of the books selected for summary is this book.  When you have the world famous author who made the startling expose on the Watergate scandal and Assistant Managing Editor of Washington Post, write about the eventful hours following the 9/11 attack at the World Trade Center, your expectations are naturally very high.  But Woodward lets you down, as this book leans heavily on transcripts of National Security Council meetings and extended interviews including over 4 hours of interview with George Bush, to reveal the layers of decision making process that followed the cataclysmic incident.  By providing the details of the close-door meetings amongst the key central players, we do get to size up partially on the personality of those involved.  We are privy to the arguments and ideological differences amongst the principal leaders as President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, CIA Director George Tenet, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, forcefully put their weight and power behind their viewpoints and decisions.  We are treated to how the CIA successfully waged an intelligence war against Afghanistan leading to the fall of the Taliban.  Beyond that we get precious little in terms of clear opinion on the dynamics of the decision making or the wisdom behind it.  A mere reportage of the collection of meetings and interviews are best served in a newspaper, and thus could ideally have found its way into Washington Post.  In the publication of a book, we expect a renowned media investigator as Woodward to undertake a more serious study such as on policy matters or the depth of leadership involved or an incisive analysis of personalities and so forth.  This is a rather tame book and hardly adds anything of great value, and much less so to the trailblazing work that Woodward is capable of.  
 The radio controlled "atomic" clock is not based on a mature technology.  Mis-communications could happen quite often.  The programmers did not build a robust program to check and eliminate these mis-communications (a very simple task).  As a result, the clock could display wrong time randomly under certain conditions, and therefore could cost the user big damage.  I have three atomic clocks.  They had displayed wrong time at least 20 times in the past year.  Sometimes this happens simultaneously to two clocks--they showed two different times and both of them were not correct.  Since there is no way to turn off the radio receiver, the clock simply cannot be trusted.  Using a regular clock, at least I know it is within a few seconds to the real time.  Using an atomic clock, I don't know anything about the correctness of the time it shows.  My atomic clocks were off 35, 65, 120, 60, etc. minutes many times (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind).  Today, it made me got up an hour earlier in the morning.  It showed 6:00am when I looked at it.  It was raining and was dark.  I got up and took a shower.  When I came out of the bathroom, I payed attention to a regular clock in my kitchen.  It showed 5:05am.  After I verified with the time showed on my watch, I realized that I was cheated by the atomic clock AGAIN.  What a wreck 
 I should have known that decorating "Martha-style" would not be my style.  Her passion in finding the "old" at bargain prices and making it "work" for her is not what I call decorating.  She loves to re-furbish, re-store and re-model ... I don't.  However, my expectations were really dashed after completion of the book and realized there was no valid reason for her publisher to classify it as a decorating book.  If you like to read about Martha's homes, her anecdotes and her convoluted names of Martha-labled paint colors, you will enjoy it ... maybe.  I've seen and heard it all before.  
 I thought this book was HORRIBLE.  I didn't even finish it and can not recommend this book at all 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 I enjoyed reading this novel, all right-- parts are so bad they deserved to be enshrined in one of Pronzini's Gun In Cheek books.  To say that the psychology in this novel is sound is akin to saying that an abandoned shack in the woods would pass building code inspection.  And I'm not even factoring in Brown's homophobia (which, even as a straight guy, I found annoying) or the fact that a chronic alcoholic-- I'm sorry, _heavy drinker_-- could function as well as this reporter does.  The ending, in which the reporter keeps the killer at bay (for several hours!) is deliciously bad in the best tradition of wretched pulp fiction.  I recently read a few W. R. Burnett novels (Little Ceasar and Asphalt Jungle) which were written a decade or two before this but hold up a lot better.  Brown has written some good stuff, but this novel doesn't deserve its "classic" status 
 I had the TomTom Go 510 for about 5 days before I decided to return it.  Overall, the user interface is great, and very easy to understand and configure.  The setup was easy, and I also thought that the windshield suction-cup mount worked well, which I know a lot of other people complained about.  The items that led me to return the unit are as follows: 1) Bluetooth hands free- the clarity on this wasn't bad on my end, but the anyone I talked to on the other end of the phone couldn't hear me well.  I had the external mic on my visor, so it was probably no more than 2 feet from my mouth.  Unless I was holding it in front of my mouth, the connection wasn't clear.  I also had problems where my Motorola RAZR V3 would simply disconnect from the TomTom for no reason, or send a call straight to voicemail rather than letting it ring through the TomTom. 2) The Point of Interest database is lacking.  I had read this in other articles, but didn't believe it could be that bad.  I was wrong! Basically, when it comes to restaurants, it only contains fast food, and aside from that, anything retail related is lacking.    If you are just looking for navigation where you aren't relying on POIs and don't need hands free calling, this unit would work fine...but then again, without those features you could get something much cheaper that would get the job done!  Overall, this product is not worth the money 
 I picked this book up at a dollar store so I guess I got my moneys worth . this book gives very little info compared to it's size. It does have some useful info on the morning star ratings and Bata.  For me it seems to give a lot of info  what people do wrong but not How to do it right. 
 When is everyone going to learn - there is no such thing as a how-to-get-rich book.  The title for the book is a joke itself.  Trump and his editors were probably laughing all the way to the bank when they thought of the title.  Seriously, if anybody knows the secret on how to get rich, why would he tell you?  This book is nothing more than a ploy to get some extra dough by capitalizing on the success of The Apprentice.  There is so much white space in the book because there is not much writing in terms of quantity or quality!  The advice is so mundane.  Half of the book is memoirs of a week as Trump - boooring.  And I don't want to read about the show in the last chapter.  I cannot believe this book was published.  The writing stinks and there is even some typos.  Trump may produce quality buildings, but that cannot be said of his books 
 Eileen Barker seems to spend most of this book apologising for the cult's behavior and practices and every turn rather than telling parents what they can do to help their troubled children.  Barker should have spent more time listening to former members, and less time talking to the cult leaders 
 This book tends to jump off topic (most aren't explained well). For example, they talk about one thing but the exercises are a bit different than the chapter's topic. Most of the information isn't fully explained. If you are in a class where the instructor assigns the exercise questions for homework, you are screwed. You may not know what to do unless you seek outside help (study guide, tutor etc.) or read beyond the chapter 
 I couldn't send this item back quickly enough.  I presumed by its price being 2 to 3 times that of other foot massagers, that it would be an effective, high quality item. NEVER PRESUME!    With a low powered hair dryer mounted in the middle, it sounds like a small aircract while the base vibrates uncontrolably.  I'd say about twice as much energy was disbursed out the feet of the unit to my hardwood floor than to my feet.    I'm not someone with unreasonable expectactions as many of the reviewers I've read seem to have.  This is just an unusable product.  The materials look cheaper in person, it offers virtually no "massage" to the foot, and it is incredibly loud.  There is no redeeming quality to this item.    Before I bought it, I looked all over the web for a review, unable to find one.  Hopefully I can save someone else the disappointment.  Did I mention I hated it 
 I was disappointed with how dirty the book was.  I had to remove a dead insect from one of the chapters.  
 This looks like such a great toy, and the packaging is really impressive, but don't be fooled like we were. I assumed that by paying close to 25 dollars it would be somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-I don't expect much from plastic toys...but this is really really bad. You might also think that paying that much would give you things like closable doors...you know, 99 cent matchbox cars' doors stay closed, but the space shuttle's doors don't-which limit it's "fun" factor. The "movable arm" is just a free floating plastic stick that simply is stuck into a hole..It doesn't even stay in. The "launch pad" and the fuel tank/boosters are down right horrible. They don't connect to the shuttle, which was disapointed all of us, especially my son. And it is so cheaply made, I really can't believe that it wasn't bought from the dollar store. My son was so excited for this set. But after playing with it for just a few minutes he hasn't gotten it out again. I would definately NOT recommend this 
 Episode two of the hunt for the bumbling master spy(Peacemaker) is an improvement over the unfortunate initial episode, No Graves as Yet. There are some good scenes: the beaches at Gallipoli, the amusing downfall of Judy's competitor for the General's wheel, the encounter with the German sub, etc.  But we still have the preposterous underlying theme that George V would trade continental Europe for German help in retaking the United States for the British Empire. That task made more difficult as Miss Perry has Mexican armies pouring over the Southwestern border to conquer the U.S. Even Zimmerman didn't expect that much.  Then there is Private Corliss who dominates the opening chapters by suffering a crushed hand, a suspected Self Inflicted Wound(SIW), for which he is court martialed and sentenced to death.  In WWI, the test for an SIW was whether the injury was caused by British ammunition, not the case here. There were 3,894 recorded SIWs in the British Army during the war; the penalty was a prison sentence. No one was subject to the death penalty for an SIW. We have Chaplain Joseph who spends half the book playing police detective; a general in command of substantial forces at Ypres who spends most of his time with his attractive driver and seems to have no contact with his regimental commanders or the battles; a reporter for a small newspaper chain whose accurate depiction from Gallipoli would cause millions of Britons to abandon the war, even though the millions had already heard the truth from their sons, daughters, and husbands; etc. On the bright side, there is a new Pitt mystery, Long Spoon Lane, where Miss Perry makes us feel right at home in both the drawing rooms and the slums of Victorian London.  IMO her reach toward World War I is a war too far. 
 Oh Lord, this book is so unbelievably frustrating....more than any book I've ever read.  Eisner, his life and his actions are so completely fascinating and Masters somehow manages to take all this great material and make it mind-numbingly boring...what was she thinking? That you could write a "nuanced" portrait of someone by throwing in hot gossip, sound bites, bits of articles from Time and Newsweek, as well as a bunch of stories that don't remotely relate to the main subject but are "dishy"?  There was so much I wanted to know as I read this book, so many questions I had and she didn't answer any of them. Masters discusses Eisner's charm vs. his ruthlessness, she brings up provacative examples of his relationship to his family, his friends and his colleagues, and then steamrolls all of them by emphasizing how "aloof" he is and "imperial." Doesn't she know that when sketching a complicated portrait of someone, you can't just throw a bunch of facts around but you have to maintain interest by putting them TOGETHER to form a PERSPECTIVE, a CONTEXT.  Much more time should have been spent on Eisner's days at Disney (rather than the completely gratuitous tales of his time at Paramount, and Star Trek, and Nimoy, and Gene Roddenberry, and Don Simpson, and Barry Diller, and...well you get the picture).  I liked the parts about his childhood and his relationship to his parents, they should have been given much more space...but the biggest flaw of this book is the lack of info on the Eisner-Katzenberg relationship.  Sure, Masters give plenty of space to financial issues about Katzenberg's bonus, but aside from Wall Street enthusiasts, who the hell cares? She COMPLETELY glosses over the roots of the Eisner-Katzenberg bond, and we never get an idea of WHY IN THE WORLD DID THESE TWO PEOPLE REMAIN TOGETHER FOR 19 YEARS IF THEY WERE SUCH ENEMIES? What held them together? How exactly did they meet?  She talks about how Katzenberg was won over, like others, by Eisner's self-deprecating charm and his (Eisner's) confidence in him, about Katzenberg's not-so-great childhood and his problems with his own parents (very vague descriptions there as well) and how Katzenberg constantly "sought Eisner's approval".  Why? What did Eisner offer him that no one else did? Why did Katzenberg follow Eisner from Paramount to Disney? She spends a whole lot of time talking (in a dry, Variety-kind-of-way) about the break-up, but the real question she (and other writers) have often missed is NOT why this relationship crashed and burned but why it was born in the first place.  Why did Eisner need Katzenberg? Why did Katzenberg become so enamoured with animation, with his role at Disney, with a potential role as Eisner's number 2? These people are not carbon cut-outs, they are people.  They are fascinating, complex characters and Masters gives them with about as much focus as subjects of an obituary.  She seems more interested in how much money Captain EO lost, how much money Eisner allegedly cheated certain people out of, how much money Eisner paid Michael Ovitz, how much money Katzenberg wanted, how pissed Leonard Nimoy was at Paramount, what a disaster Star Trek: The Motion Picture was to produce.  I don't know about you, but I didn't pick that book up to learn about this stuff. It's SO DIFFICULT to really learn about these people (Eisner and Katzenberg) despite their famous "relationship" or "feud" extremely little is really written about their interactions together as people...you have to research a ton of articles to even find out anything...this is such an interesting subject but whatever Master's knows that the rest of us don't, she isn't sharing. Her book (like many articles) unfortunately is pervaded with the "Everyone knows this" kind of tone that drives me nuts...well, I'm not a Hollywood producer, or director, or actor.  I've never met either of these people, but that's why I'm interested! People buy books on Spielberg because they're interested, why the hypocricy? Masters book is slanted, glib, gossipy, disorganized, unfocused,and worst of all, insulting to the reader 
 The difficulty with this disc is that people are naturally overwhelmed when a family of Julliard-trained musicians comes along playing the favorites in an unconventional manner.  I will admit that they are very in sync and that they have a mass-market appeal that people like Pierre Boulez simply will not have.  However, the quality of their music is not consistent to garner the praises of the thousands that they have.  Some of the siblings simply play better than the others. However, some of the arrangements are enjoyable, and some of the pieces had genuine enrergy.   There were only a few outright failures: the arrangement of 'Simple Gifts', the Lutoslawski, and the Danzas Argentinas.  The 'Simple Gifts' just isn't well arranged, and the playing is uninspired and lacks energy.  I don't think that they understood the Paganini variations well, because it doesn't have the sparkle and virtuosity that permeates the piece.  The Ginastera is played far too slowly without any thought about the natural eneregy that the composer took from his homeland and infused into the first and third dances.  Although they will probably still be hugely popular, I would suggest that potential buyers should refrain from purchasing this underperformed disc and wait until another disc comes out that is more musically successful than this one.  For die-hard converts, there is enough good material here to entertain. actual- 3 star 
 I purchased this book some 6-8 months ago and I have used it and the resourses provided by Thomas on a daily basis.  I am a nurse and I am looking to retire int he nxt couple of years.  You cannot buy another book on the market that provide the informaiton and resources that this book provides. I give it a 5+rating 
 If I could give this book zero stars, I would do so. There's barely a plot: the protagonist, Janie, marries three men and kills the last one because he gets rabies. The end. Janie is the ultimate antiheroin. She comes off as this oppressed little wife who takes forever to speak out against her husbands. It would have been better if Alice Walker had not "found" Zora Hurston and brought this awful book back into the public. 
 What a disappointment!  It sure looks like there's a good mystery in this book somewhere but digging through all the detail and ploding style is just too much.  A great read if you're looking to become an insurance claims adjuster 
 GA. how can anyone stand this drivel? worst movie i ever watched repeatedly. worse than watching "walk tall" 8 times in a row. worse even than watching the home shopping network. eww. EWW 
 This is the only book in my collection that I did not bother to finish. I have been reading on the subject since my early youth but this book could not retain my attention. It seemed repetitious at times and simply put...boring. I will end up using it as filler material for the bottom of my book shelf 
 My 16 month old LOVES Elmo and Sesame Street so I was very surprised at his reaction to this DVD.  When the Big Bad Wolf blew away Prairie Dawn and the camera, he started screaming and crying and climbing all over me (like the wolf was "getting him").  I try to remember to fast-forward past this part but sometimes forget.  He knows the scene is coming several scenes before and climbs in my lap for protection.  This comes from a child who has NEVER been frightened by anything on TV.  Also, my 2 1/2 year old neice was afraid of the very scary tornado in the weather segment.  This DVD may be appropriate for older childrn, but definitely not for toddlers 
 I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more. 
 There's no sadder sight than a man attempting to drive a square peg into a round hole.  In this case, the hole is realism and the peg, the supernatural.  Haught, who should know better, attempts to impart an outline of evolution by natural selection through self-dialog.  His method is to place himself as a practicing Christian on the one side, and responding as a Christian historian of science on the other.  He is thus able to ask himself a series of almost pertinent questions [he never really poses the most important one] and respond in an apparently knowing manner.  The supernatural peg, however, cannot be driven into the aperture of reality.  With all his good intentions and carefully crafted words, Haught fails address the real problem.  The questions are reasonable enough, and often heard.  This assumed authenticity gives a patina of value to the book.  His opening salvo sets the tone, asking why evolution is "such a religiously troubling idea".  Haught's response is to simply negate that assertion with Augustine - change over time is possible.  Citing "Church Fathers" as authorities isn't a promising start.  He continues by examining "Darwin's Revolutionary Idea" [he doesn't concede Dennett's phrase until later in the book] as challenging traditional views.  Traditional, in Haught's view, doesn't mean "absolute".  That, of course, permits science, which Haught tries to admire through the book, to push his deity further away from human context.  In effect, this book, starting with Darwin instead of Copernicus, traces the displacement of "the Creator" from up close and personal to increasingly remote and detached.  Each question Haught poses is designed to drag the Desert Deity [just the one, please note] back into Nature's processes in some guise or another.  Even if it's no more than a "sense" or "presence", the deity must be acknowledged at some level.  It's hard to imagine a more contrived appeal to special pleading.   Haught wants to be considered an "authority" on natural selection by providing answers to his imaginary questioners.  He cites Gould, E. O. Wilson and, of course, de Chardin.  Even William Hamilton's shade is enlisted, to burnish Haught's certification.  Richard Dawkins and his "philosophical supporter", Daniel C. Dennett are grudgingly acknowledged a role in expounding on "Darwin's Dangerous Idea" - where we finally arrive on page 77 - but are dismissed as "atheists".  Dawkins, of course, becomes the bete noire of Haught's presentation.  Not only is Dawkins more insightful on how evolution works, he asks the question Haught ignores - where is the evidence for the deity?  Since Haught maintains evidence is irrelevant, we are left with him still pounding away at his supernatural peg.  In his struggle to convey his science credentials, Haught manages to answer most of his own questions wrongly.  In his struggle to confound his adversaries, he manages to misquote - or selectively quote - each of them.  His use of "buzzwords" as "scare flags" is constant, but intensifies when he perceives he's on weaker ground than usual.  As the book [and the questions] progress, Haught becomes ever more frantic to assert his case.  The deity is there, somewhere - it must be!  All we have to do is figure out where.  This is no roadmap either to understanding deities or natural selection.  To cap the string of inadequacies, Haught offers a "Selected Reading" list.  The hint is in the adjective.

 you people don't actually STill think this thing is a "hero" do you?  oink, oink...he's ganna teach anyone about morals...what a joke...and all of you that still fall prey to his falasies...and fantacies.  one star because zero seems to be missing here. BIG zero 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
  After watching "Riverman" that was recently done about Washington serial killer Gary Ridgeway, I was curious to learn more about the zodiac killer. Upon seeing this movie in the rental store, I took a chance. It seemed professional and though it was a fictionalized story about the "return" of the Zodiac, I was eager to check it out. Riverman was on TV and had good acting and a great script. Easily a "made for television" movie to talk about.  Then I rented this movie...  ...I'm still gagging from my consequences.  This is not a professional done film in any way. It's an amateur attempt at filmmaking. The story follows a young man who by appearance is the average Joe. Well that's because he is just that, some guy they pulled off the street to act in this next to nothing budget film! We follow his exploits as he becomes obsessed with the Zodiac killer's past to the point that he decides to become the Zodiac killer of the present!  Packing around a nickel-plated .45 pistol in a backpack, he finds his victims by stalking them, and usually there is some motive of some sort. Deeper into the film he starts corresponding with the journalist who wrote the book about chasing the Zodiac killer. The journalist, now retired, starts talking with the boy and they become online pen pals of sorts. They meet for coffee and discuss the different aspects of the original killings.  Soon the old man suspects something is amiss with the boy and starts to suspect the worst. Not wanting to be caught off guard, he continues to speak to the boy, who the whole time is walking around the streets of wherever blowing people away.  In the end, the killer starts using a different mode of killing. He knocks his victims out with some sort of nerve agent that is in the form of pills that he adds to water. He dons a gas mask and waits for them to succumb to the gas before...you guessed it, shooting them with a .45 pistol. Only in the end it is bittersweet because he ends up getting killed by the nerve agent by none other than the journalist, who now I assume, will take up the identity of the zodiac killer and continue on...  I laugh just thinking about the errors done in the initial story. For one, anyone committing serial killings in a metropolitan area with a .45 pistol that does not have a silencer on it is going to attract immediate attention. Why is it he can shoot people in an apartment complex, walk out past people, and no one does anything? If a gun of this power goes off in an apartment building on the first level, and your outside, you're going to hear it. Yet of course there are no witnesses to these crimes, and everyone apparently in this community is deaf and blind because they see and hear nothing.  The lighting is horrible. Goodness, could we at least watch a film or read a book on HOW to make a movie before doing a project like this? Reminds me of projects we did in high school, only I think ours were better.  The packaging of this DVD is very misleading. Okay yes, there are not names of cast in it like Dennehy, Sheen, or Heather Graham. However, this movie is professionally packaged and right up they're alongside the likes of "Flightplan" "Jarhead" and "Elizabethtown". The still pics on the back don't tell me it's a below B-grade film, and it's description sounds like it's a "thriller" that is "action packed" with "suspense at every turn".  The film shots are again, amateur, and at times I kept wondering if I was watching a foreign film from the 70's. Nope, again, those are better done as well. Ulli Rommel was behind this movie, and upon looking into his other movies on several different review sites, the result is the same: Amateur filmmaking with a big enough budget to market.  The story, if given to a director like say, like Michael Mann (Heat, Miami Vice, Collateral, the Insider) could be a good modern day serial killer movie, with some good actors and say, L.A. or Miami as the backdrop of the film. That unfortunately, is a pipe dream.  The Zodiac Killer does nothing but kill your time, and is not only a poor film, but unrealistic. It is below B-grade. I forced myself to watch it all the way through only so I could make sure to tell others what they are getting into if they rent this film 
 Im surprised Rhino would put out anything but a complete collection spanning all of her labels......country stars are notorious for jumping from one label to another, which makes it hard to get all the hits in one place.  This CD covers her later, WB years, with "Dont It Make My Brown Eyes Blue" thrown in for gravy.  Nothing from her Columbia years, or her first big hits from United Artists.  The majors labels could make a collection this bad, so why should Rhino sully their sterling reputation for quality with this garbage?  I dont know, but I hope it isn't a sign of things to come..... 
 This is the worst popular science book I've read. I will defer to the above reviews, by those trained in science, for specific examples of misinformation in this book, but despite that I am only trained as a diesel mechanic, I began finding statements which made me utter, "Say, whaa'?" and "I don't think so," throughout the book. By the time I reached the part where objects have "swelled" and "puffed out" as they near the speed of light, I knew I was reading buncombe, as I had been taught in high school that they instead become shorter.  The section which concerns the development of the atomic bomb is likewise botched. That it covers this topic and completely ignores Leo Szilard, the man who not only conceived of the atomic bomb but held patents on both the bomb and the nuclear reactor, shows just how worthless this book is. It is ironic that credit for America's starting work on a nuclear program is given to Einstein here, because, contrary to the book, Einstein did not write the letters that were delivered to Roosevelt. He only signed letters that Szilard had written and Szilard handed them to Alexander Sachs to be delivered to Roosevelt. Indeed, Einstein had no inkling that an atomic bomb was possible. Once Szilard explained the concept of a fission bomb to him, Einstein admitted, "Huh! That never occurred to me."  The book's account of German's progress toward a bomb is likewise distorted. On 6 August, 1945, the team of German atomic scientists, who where interned in England, were placed in a room with hidden microphones and given the news that the USA had destroyed Hiroshima with an atomic bomb. At first they were unanimous in their disbelief, but after hearing further radio reports of it, they assumed that the USA had somehow dropped an entire nuclear reactor on the city.    This, and a far more accurate account of the German nuclear program can be found in the book "Alsos" by Samuel Goudsmit (pronounced "Howd-shmid"; a fine book profiling the people who worked on the Manhattan Project is "The Uranium People" by Leona Libby; and the best overall account of the development of nuclear weapons is the magnificent "Day One" by Peter Wyden.  "E=mc2" is not only infested with misinformation, but it is hideously written. Tortured sentences, errant punctuation, dangling modifiers, and one handsome redundancy. Near the beginning of the book, Bodanis, in describing the development of the period (.) describes it as "a round circle." A round circle! You know, as opposed to some other type of circle, such as a triangular circle or a square one?   If, as he claims, David Bodanis really taught at Oxford, then all I can say is, poor ol' Oxford ain't what it usta be. 
 NOtice that the people giving it 5 stars are the people who reviewed this product and this product alone.  Sounds like employees trying to build up ratings 
 I usually read through one of Coulter's novel in a few days, exspecially her FBI/intrigue plots. I bought this as soon has it was released in paperback and still haven't finished it. The plot was slow and the main heroine a little too likable. Spoiler: Neighborhood teenagers diving on her body to protect her from bullets?! Talk about a work of fiction. No one expects a romance to be on our plane of reality, but in the same solar system would be nice 
 I bought this book doing a search with two phrases, whole grain and bread machine. The book promises to easily convert her recipies from oven to bredmachine. She only gives a few pages that vaguely tell to modify the recipies, but not ecactly how. Judging from previous reviews, this book must have some merit. It is not for a bread machine owner that likes simple and direct instructions 
 This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par 
 David Fromkin's "Peace to End All Peace" is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. Many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other.  Fromkin attempts to examine how the modern Middle East (extending as far as Afghanistan and some sections of Central Asia) was created during and after the First World War. Obviously, in order to do this, the fall of the Ottoman Empire in that war must be considered. This is where Fromkin's unusual methodology comes into play. Focusing on the European political machinations to resolve the "Eastern Question" in their favour, the sorry tale becomes one more of Churchill and TE Lawrence than of the Arabs and Turks who were also involved in the process. Admittedly, it was the Europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn, but reducing key figures such as the CUP Triumvirate in the dying Ottoman Empire (and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much.  Never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell. A complex web of national and personal political interests in both Europe and the Middle East combined to make the region what it is today, and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations. The problem that Fromkin has, however, is that he does not make these very well at all. The story is told in a roughly chronological manner, which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters. Ultimately, the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader, who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is.  Additionally, Fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided. Indeed, one map (showing Enver Pasha's advance on Baku and his campaigns in Central Asia) is laughable in the extreme. The legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows, and not equilateral triagles.  Where Fromkin does well, however, is in his use of purely European sources. It is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern Middle East, but I have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the Middle Eastern aspects of the events in question. In terms of Europe, however, his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did.  Ultimately, "A Peace to End All Peace" is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work. A diplomatic history of Europe during the Great War can be written much better than this, and a history of the development of the Middle East following that conflict already has been (the chapters in Margaret Attwood's "The Peacemakers" or William Cleveland's "Modern Middle East" both easily outshine this) 
 Ariel Sharon is the perfect example of tragedy of Israeli political culture in which men who prove themselves on the battlefield are then wrongly believed to be qualified to be national leaders.  Sharon is widely believed to be Israel's greatest battlefield commander.  He created the fighting spirit Israel was famous for in the 1950's and 60's by his formation of the well-known Unit 101.  Instead of retiring to a well-deserved rest and chance to provide for his family, his arrogance led him to enter Israeli politics.  From here, his character flaws of dishonesty and lack of values began to take their toll on Israeli public life.  First, he became one of the founders of the right-wing Likud party in 1973, but by the time the 1977 elections came around, he had left it and founded a left-wing party committed to an independent Palestinian state, which was rejected at that time by the Leftist Labor Party.  Since Menachem Begin won the election instead of the incumbent Labor Party, he veered to the Right again and joined the cabinet, becoming champion of the settlement movemend in the Judea/Samaria/Gaza territories taken in the 1967 war.  However, Begin decided to give away the Sinai, so Sharon was put in charge of destroying the Jewish communities there, so he was appointed Defense Minister and carried this out.  Right after this, he launched Israel on its Lebanese mis-adventure.  Forced out of office as a result of it, he lowered his profile and built an alliance with Labor leaders Shimon Peres who ostensibly was on the other side of the fence politically, but that did not prevent these two from collaborating quietly.  When the opportunity for Sharon came to become Prime Minister, he suddenly announced that the destruction of the Jewish communities in the Sinai was "a mistake".  This helps propel him to the Prime Minister's Office in 2001 by lining up support of the Right.  The Terror War of the Palestinians which started in autumn 2000 discredited the Labor Party and its Prime Minister Ehud Barak.  Sharon was elected to put an end to it, but instead, he forms a cabinet with his friend Peres and then announces that the terror really can't be stopped.  Finally, with the Pesach Night massacre in the Park Hotel in Netanya in 2002, Sharon was forced to act.  Finally, military pressure is applied and slowly the terror war is subdued.  Sharon announces during his 2003 re-election campaign that it is unthinkable to destroy the Jewish communities in the Gaza Strip as his opponent Mitzna suggests, but after being re-elected overwhelmingly on that platform, suddenly turns around, makes an alliance with the Far Left and adopts an even more radical form of Mitzna's plan.  Of course, the Left now loves Sharon since he betrayed his voters (including this reviewer who volunteered to work for his campaign), but this unbelievably cynical man is a danger to the entire Zionist enterprise.  Although the book is interesting, his habitual deceitfulness makes me wonder about the veracity of many things stated in the book.   This book shows that he has made a great contribution to building Israel, particularly in his early days, but I hope Israelis will wake up and look for integrity in their leaders, and not just a military uniform.  
 This is very BAD---doesnot work and really interfers with other programs. Almost impossible to remove it. 
 I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
 This book is great if you want to know what kind of rigging each ship had. You will not get how many crewman it took to sail each ship unless its a galley then you can figure it out by how many oars it had. On some you will get the tonnage of a particular ship but not always. You don't get any idea the cargo it was able to hold in tonnage or what type of cargo it mainly shipped. Nothing about what kind of weaponary ie cannon 6pounder,12pounder etc. I did like the pictures. I did learn about ships that I never knew existed. Thats why I said fluff in the title 
 For the total novice who has very limited experience in writing and publishing, this book will be treasure trove, especially if that novice is planning to write a non-fiction book. For everyone else, this book has lesser value. I found it offered very little for writers of fiction. The information offered was also rather basic; for a person with a moderate amount of writing experience, the book offered little in the way of insightful information. The "for Dummies" part of the title definitely applies in this case 
 Jon Katz is an idiot.  Anyone who sells him a dog better be prepared for him to kill the dog rather than deal with any issues.  Although this book is being sold as a nice dog story, it is anything but.  Jon Katz once again decides to kill his dog rather than put himself out.  (In an earlier book, he killed his supposedly beloved labs because he couldn't bear to see them anything less than 100% healthy.)  In this book, he decides to kill his supposed "soul mate" dog Devon AKA  Orson, because he does not want to be bothered to manage the dog's enviroment.  Orson bites a couple of people, and Katz decides he doesn't want to be bothered keeping the dog in an enclosed yard because it would "be a prison".  If you are a dog lover, do NOT buy this book.  You will just be pissed off by Katz's behavior.  
 i don't know, fool for the city is the only one you need from foghat because it has the longer 8 minute version of the song slow ride! this is just a waste of my time. 
 I WAS SOOO DISAPOINTED IN THIS BOOK.. I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF FINISH READING IT, AND I'M ONE OF HER BIGGEST FANS.. 
 Ok so I have always thought Courteney Cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it. It really is the most boring show Ive seen in a long time. If you thought she was bad in scream...and friends..dont watch this...there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it. Hopefully this show will be scraped 
 I hated this book alot. Miriam made the Indians seem disgusting and barbaric. She kept talking about how bad the Indians were and blaming her family for being captured, I really thought it was dull 
 with the conclusion of this album,we are mercifully spared further "punk rock" classics from this pretentious group of egos - if you want to hear some innovation from this time period,pick up anything by the Minutemen.your money will go a lot farther.. 
 This dictionary was required material for my first Arabic course.  However, I often found natives saying "we never use this" when I would ask them about translations found in the dictionary.  Very rarely, if ever, are the translations within it correct.  As such, it has found its place in my home as a home-made picture frame.  If you need an English-Arabic dictionary, you can't go wrong with Al-Mawrid.  I'd stay away from the Oxford at all costs.  It is so concise it has left out accuracy altogether 
 I bought this book expecting to immerse myself in an epic struggle of Good vs. Evil.  I got a facile tale of the Southwest.  Buyers beware!  This is not the Miltonian epic, but rather a wolf in sheep's clothing 
 I started with high hopes. Afterall, Orloffs books get rave reviews. Fifty one pages into the book, I put it down. My intuition tells me she's a frustrated fiction writer laboring under a consuming fascination with herself, her life and all things that make her special.   Even though I found a few insights here and there that weren't bad, there weren't enough to slog through all the purple prose. In fact, out of pure curiosity, on page fifty-one, I got out my editing pen and crossed a line through each word or phrase on the page that didn't need to be there. At the end, I'd crossed out half the page. A little math told me that half the book wasn't necessary so I stopped while I was ahead.   Sadly, I'd also bought SECOND SIGHT, which was also a big waste of money for the same reason. If she were the only person writing on the subject of intuition, I'd have worked harder, but there are much better intuitives out there writing much better books 
 The author and I had the good fortune to grow up in cities shaped by the street car. Even though the cars were going or gone by the 1950's, many cities retained the urban patterns established sixty and seventy years before. Hoping that light-rail might bring about a return of street car city neighborhoods, I was looking for useful information that might fuel the cause of light-rail. From that aspect the book was disappointing.  As a history of 20th century urban development, it seems uneven. Who killed the street cars? Conservative Republicans? In New York City it was LaGardia with backing from the Roosevelt administration. The same was true in city after city through the 1940's and 1950's. Democratic party controlled cities from coast to coast dumped the street car in order to "modernize". Would Mr. Marshall be surprised to know that Paul Weyrich and the conservative Free Congress Foundation are light-rail advocates?  Mr. Marshall seems too impassioned in a quest for big government to provide a useful roadmap. Cities such as St. Louis, Denver, Houston, and San Jose hope that building light-rail lines will be followed by dense urban development, without 'growth limits' like those in Portland Oregon or Boulder CO. Why does the author think that will not work? Why would the heavy hand of government in Portland not eventually bring about the same results as Boulder CO? Because they started with more open space? It has to fill up eventually. Why ignore the evidence that light-rail does lead to dense urban redevelopment? Even without growth limits. Why not give people a choice? Suburban sprawl vs. a livable urban environment with light-rail? I say "no thanks" to Disney's fake cities too, but if some folks want to live in one (gag- choke-gasp), it is their choice. Mr. Marshall may still have the last word. Maybe Portland's growth limits are necessary to prevent a suburban ring from choking the central city. I would hope the same could be accomplished by not building any more freeway lanes in dense urban areas. That seems to be on the verge of the politically possible in Denver CO.  For those interested in a light-rail revival and the renewal of cities that could bring about, I recommend "Light Rail and Heavy Politics" by Jack McCroskey. Chock full of useful ideas. It  discusses the obstacles that arose, and how they were overcome. McCroskey's book is filled with tidbits of useful information that seem to be few and far between in Mr. Marshall's work.  
 I love Jet Li, I collect all his dvds but this movie really [stank]! Don't buy it even for the collection! Nobody will notice that you don't have it 
 Huston Smith's worldview should be obvious to those who have read his previous books, or to those who read this one critically. It is perennialism, not Christianity. Perennialists, such as Aldous Huxley, Joseph Campbell, and Ken Wilber, hold that all religions share a common mystical  and esoteric core: all is one and all is divine. The exoteric trappings of religion--such as their official creeds and Scriptures--may seem to affirm otherwise, but never mind. (Sadly, the two evangelical authors who endorsed this book either did not understand Smith's perspective or wrongly thought it not significant enough to withhold their endorsement.)  Thus, while using words common to Christian faith and appealing to various Bible texts, Smith redefines the meaning of every theological term he uses and imposes an essentially pantheistic and monistic worldview upon the Bible, adjusting it to his perennialist and Procrustean bed for appropriate mutilations.  Smith's very definition of Christianity (p. 33) lacks any reference to Jesus Christ, the incarnate founder of it. This is because Smith's philosophical categories trump the teachings of Jesus and his apostles.  If one is impressed with Smith's rendering of Christianity or if one wants a truer description of it, it is advisable to read the Bible itself as well as to consider books more faithful to what the Bible's basic message, such as John Stott's "Basic Christianity" and Walter Martin's "Essential Christianity." To understand the tactics that Smith and others use in misinterpreting the Bible, see James Sire, "Scripture Twisting."  I will have a longer review of "The Soul of Christiantiy" published in "The Christian Research Journal" in the near future. 
 This book is simply boring.  There are fun things to it, especially if you know your Irish history, but these out-of-date parodies are still not good enough to make it worth reading.  Under the narrative of Thady Quirk, which is -- at least to me -- fairly hard to get through, we are taken through the history of a protestant landlord family. If you truly dissect the book, there are interesting sides of it, but just as a plain reading, I found it simply boring. It is short and doesn't go into any detailed description of the many events that are told to the reader/listener, it's value were supposedly the mocking of the protestant ruling class of Ireland. Since that value is lost to most contemporary readers, there isn't all that much left 
 Unfortunately Mr. Hayman has taken a clever script and a handful of talented actors and combined them with chopping editing, unfeeling direction and a handful of bad actors. This had the potential to be a witty and entertaining film. Instead it turned out to be a real disappointment. It is my opinion that Ms. Russell should perhaps take up doing childrens' material. Children like over-acting. 
 Okay, the concept of this game cube is great, and believe me: you will spend many hours trying to solve this puzzle. Now on to the reality... I first tried this brain buster in the eighties when it came out. Upon its first release, the stickers stayed on, the plastic squares didn't break off, and it just seemed like a higher quality piece. I beleive the plastic might have been heavier. But now, twenty years later, the stickers peal off, the squares pop out. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!  If this was made in the USA it would now cost more than it does being manufactured over seas, however ...it wouldn't be junk. You get what you pay for.  Stephen John Beccia Author of The Treelanders 
 Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is.  What robs this courtroom thriller is what's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way, an actual case in controversy.  Maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture, Hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them.  Instead of a compelling case, we have one that's ready for our verdict as soon as we've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices.  The case in "Class Action" is one you can typify as "David & Goliath", which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power.  There's no way that we're going to see a case won (even by dishonest means) by Donald Moffat's hired band of Harvard-trained professional liars, and there's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments.  Maggie's bosses are so transparently bad, that not only do they screw up, but even their explanations are patently evil  Even so, the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery, and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless.  For a thriller about high-paid lawyers, "Class Action" has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial, with fewer suprises 
 Only the most die hard Heinlein fans would want to read this. On the other hand, I think most die hard Heinlein fans who read it will wish they hadn't. This is not good, and is a disservice to his legacy 
      It is amazing that Bob Woodard is this genius that can pick out all of the flaws within the Bush Administration.  How does he have access to all of this information......Oh thats right he really doesn't.       I am all for freedom of the press but shouldn't he be reporting it instead of writing a book about it?  Then again, perhaps the newspapers wouldn't publish this three legged chair of a novel.  Still, I have to admit that going into Iraq was a f**k up.  I didn't need Bob Woodward to tell me that.         Hey Bob, remember that Rommel did not know what was going on around him at the time he was fighting in North Africa (read his memoirs), neither do you or your "sources".         We were wrong to go into Iraq based on British Intelligence and a British Prime Ministers word (thats three times they have misled us into war).  Now that we know we were wrong we are truly stuck there until we can leave honorably.  To leave it in a mess would only make matters worse for that country.  We are obligated to attempt to put out the fire we started. It sucks but that how life works 
 The story itself is fairly benign, but when you have to start explaining the what, why, and wherefore of spin-the-bottle to your 4-year-old, things get a little sticky. Why would the author and publisher want to insert such content--which would resonate more with the 12-14 year-old crowd--into a book for 4-8 year olds? Also, it reduces a wonderful boy-girl friendship into the "standard" sexual attraction relationship. There's enough of that on TV geared toward young kids. Why not let them enjoy simple sincere friendships for another few blissful years 
 This book is too technical and has too much math. A better book for the elementary learner is "Practical Statistics: Simply Explained," by Russell Langley.  Bulmer's book may be useful to me later on after I understand basic statistics. But don't waste your money if you know little about statistics and you don't like complex mathematical explanations 
 I am a huge fan of Elvis Costello and ran to the shop as soon as I read the great reviews of this album, what a mistake!!!   Very few of the arrangements offer an improvement over the original version. The cardboard cut salsa montuno of 'Clubland' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful Ska sound of 'Watching the Detectives' is lost in a jazz arrangement that doesn't offer much to the melody.  Elvis' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of 'Almost Blue' and most of the songs. It worked well on his 'Juliet Letters' album because the Brodsky Quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the Metropole Orkest it is just painful.  For me,'Hora Decubitus' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble 
 blue orchid is a great song but the rest of the album sux...the songs are kinda weird 
 If you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer, this book will provide lots of information.  It also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog.  But  for my taste, I found the photographic results to be uninspiring - too much posing, too much portraiture lighting, not enough of just plain capturing that  wonderful dog as it is 
 Women write excellent novels about women. This should not be startling news. Some men write well about women, but not that many. This also should not be news. Baldacci does an excellent job. He stays away from sex and clothing. LeCarre does a magnificent job. Robert B. Parker on occasion hits nothing but net with his new 'Sunny Randall' series, but not all the time. Too often, they're male characters who are a size 5. This is the case with Deaver and 'Rune.'  First of all, the one name bit. Who are we kidding? Have you in your personal lives ever known a human being with one name? I  have not. I don't know anyone who knows any one named persons. So at the very outset, it's incredible.  Then she's an assistant camera person who talks her way into the major talent on a news program, and talks herself into an assignment of major consequences. That happens every day. She worked in a video store before this! She was a salesgirl!  She lives on a houseboat in Manhattan. Now you know that Manhattan, insofar as Real Estate goes, makes Ann Arbor, Lincoln Park and Santa Barbara look like the ghetto. So . . . how? How does she afford this? She has a $50,000 dollar camera . . . how?  Her tastes are promiscuous, she's caring for a 4 year old abandoned child, feeding her cheetos and sardines, she get's a murderer out of prison on guile and deception.  It was a struggle, Mr. Deaver, to finish this book. And finally, most readers CAN'T STAND when the agent says 'Hey, you're really selling now. Got anything you wrote 20 years ago?' That's what this is. It's just a republication of a republication. Come on. We deserve more than that. We are your faithful fans. 1 star. Larry Scantlebury 
 I taught a basic undergraduate microbiology class using this text book. The students were mostly pre-nursing so we had a clinical focus. My main problem with the text is it is trying to be all things to all people. It tries to present too much information that is scattered all over the text. Frequently, within chapters, students have to jump back and forth to material presented in other chapters and it simply becomes information overload. In addition, some of the study question, especially the clinically oriented ones, ask the students about areas that haven't been adequately covered in the text or assume knowledge that they don't have as yet. Finally, beware the Powerpoint slide presentations. These are also full of errors and need pretty extensive editing 
 This book starts off by praising the authors, and then does very little to justify it.  The authors create false categories of "bullies".  The book is riddled with contradictions that makes one wonder if it was actually edited.  The entire value of the book is that it does inform the reader that (1) bullies need to harm and control others, (2) that's just the way they are - don't try to understand them, and (3) do not suffer because there are ways to deal with it.  I suggest you find those ways in another book.  I was recommened "Jerks at Work. 
 This book is by far not the best book that I have read on pirates.  It is written more for a woman who is feeling bad about her sexuality.  The book is an effort to list every woman, fictional and otherwise, that has ever had a role in maritime history. The book starts out by talking about ancient gods (yes, female gods) that related to the sea.  This discussion is better saved for a book on mythology because it was a good summary of female gods but it did not pertain to pirates.  The book moves on and talks about female pirates through the ages all over the world.  While this is somewhat informative I believe that the significance of these woman pirates in history is way overstated.  Female pirates were very few and far between, and many really shouldn't be considered pirates.  The best part of the book was the discussion of the most netorious women pirates, Mary Read and Anne Bonny.  These two chapters were interesting and informative but they were also burried in the book.  I would suggest a book that includes but is not limited to woman pirates because the fact is that there were very few woman pirates in history.  The last quarter of the book focused on the politics of the Jolly Roger.  This section helped to save the book but it often repeated and contradicted the first part of the book.  I noticed a few inaccurate statements in this section, but on the whole this section was well done.  This book is not a total waste of time, but it gets off topic and overstates things in my opinion.  Women have played a huge part in world history, just not as pirates 
 This book was a little hard to follow both in content and techniques.  All of the recipies are written in both English and Chinese languages which gets a little confusing.  These are not what I would call recipies for  beginners 
 this ablum mad me loose a lot of respect for this band. dont bull this . get some of there earlier stuff 
 In fact, I'd say it's their worst.  While I can listen to a couple songs off it, I don't go out of my way to do so.  This is just overall a pretty bad album.  After their last album ("Year of the Spider"), I knew this was coming.  I hate to say it, but they're done.  If you want to hear Cold when they were good, listen to "13 Ways to Bleed Onstage".  I'd stay away from this one 
 Churchill is one of the most amazing figures of the last century - yet with all of his background to pick from, this book doesn't present much of him.  This is basically the author sort of randomly meandering around through Churchill's life and then stating his opinion of certain decisions Churchill made. And it's done without providing much of a framework for the various events he discusses. I've read a lot about Churchill and yet I was lost at times trying to figure out where/what/when on some of the events.  There is a lot better out there (William Manchester's 2 volumes for example) 
 This book is so riddled with errors and exaggerations that it is a wonder why Oxford University Press would publish it. 
 I give this book a 1 star not because it wasn't interesting - it certainly was, but because the ending absolutely floored me!  Aghgh**&&*(7#!!!!!  I never thought it was going to end like that - where was the justice??  I feel like something is missing.  I want to reach into the book and smack Alex! Please tell me there is a follow-up book where Sam gets what's coming to him!!! -- Oh, and Daphne too 
 The novel, A Northern Light, by Jennifer Donnelly, is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a teenage farm girl, bound for a great future.  Jennifer Donnelly relates to Mattie Gokey, the lead character, in a way that they bother grew up in rural side of New York.  Donnelly attended the University of Rochester before she wrote her three novels and one children's book. Her novels include, The Tea Rose, The Winter Rose, A Northern Light, and a children's book, Humble Pie. All of her novels include a very popular romantic theme and her book, A Northern Light, has also been introduced in Europe under the title A Gathering Light. 	A Northern Light reflects a lot on the issues of wealth, education, love, and murder.  The combination of those themes makes for a novel that anyone is able to read and relate to.  As you read this book, you feel like the main message is the traditional cliché of following your dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve. But as you read further, you realize that it's a lot about hardships, strength and love.  On the first page of the book, Mattie is imagining a perfect day at the Glenmore hotel before she so disappointingly tells herself, "I believe these things. With all my heart.  For I am good at telling myself lies".  From this quote, you can see the type of person Mattie is, and it gives a foreshadowing to the events that would take place throughout the novel.  The events typically consist of let down after let down for Mattie and her hopes for her future.    	This book is written from Mattie's point of view which really helps the reader to get to know her better.  It adds a different element to the book that wouldn't be there if it wasn't written from Mattie's point of view.  It lets you get inside Mattie's head and feel the emotions that she's dealing with along with her true thoughts and feeling towards situations.  Mattie is truly troubled girl who works so hard toward what she wants and yet there is always something holding her back. She's stuck in a farming town where education isn't as important as having a prosperous farm and a family. As you read this book, you just want to tell Mattie that she needs to take her own future into consideration and stop worrying long enough to have some faith.  She is a selfless giver who is willing to do anything and everything to keep her family and her farm doing well.  She deals with extreme guilt for wanting to leave her father after her mother died.  She has to learn that the promise that she made to her mother to always take care of her family includes taking care of herself as well.  Royal Loomis enters Mattie's life at a very unconventional time when Mattie's unsure of what she wants to become and she has to chose between his love and the life she's always wanted.  Mattie deals with her teacher, Miss Wilcox, leaving town.  Miss Wilcox was Mattie's role model who was living the life of an independent poet with a car and a royal lifestyle.  The life Mattie wants.     	This book is intended for a female audience because it deals with issues that sometime only a girl could understand.  It's a fairly easy read so it is more for adolescents than adults but not for young children.  The issues that it deals with are issues that children may not be able to appreciate as much as teenagers who are about to go to college and leave their families.  A Northern Light is full of valuable lessons, but most of all it's just a good book to get lost in.   		  
 This book is probably useful for learning what missionaries are up to out there in the non-Christian world.  However, it does not stop to ask whether they SHOULD be out there.  And of course, from a cross-cultural and anthropological point of view, they should not.  It is arrogant, ethnocentric, and culturally destructive to spread a culturally-relative and almost certainly false ideology and belief system where it is not needed or wanted.  Missionaries have been the source of much of the world's trouble, and they still are.  But more essentially, the whole idea of missionazation is judgmental and intolerant. Why do those people need you and your "belief"?  How would you like it if they were missionizing you!  Oh, but you think your religion is true!  Well, so do they!  It seems all missionaries and those they missionize have in common is a lack of cultural understanding.  If we recognized religion as the relative (different in different places, not "true" in any meaningful way) and damaging, irrational thing it is, we would stop supporting it and start supporting real efforts that help people in real ways 
 An even though it's fiction, the incidents seem to fall out of the movies context to become contrived. Boring nonsence on a teen hormone kick 
 I like Math, Not circler illogic.  Took this course in 1997; while my professor was initially excited since he had known Lay, he soon simply shook his head in disgust, and said he needs to talk to his old friend 
 This book was a big disappointment. It seems half the pages are just print outs of forms, budgets, etc. The information tucked between the pages of forms is the same stuff found in many more comprehensive and readable books. It seemed to be written by a computer, not a person. The index is weak as is the glossary. These folks made one movie and thought they could tell the rest of the world how it's done. The hubris is only exceeded by the vapidity. Sent mine back for a refund 
 This is the first digital camera that I have owned.  Overall I am generally satisfied with the quality of the pictures it produces.  However, there are a few things that, if I had known beforehand, would have prevented me from purchasing this camera.  1) Camera is not plug-and-play (even if they say it is).  You have to install the Kodak EasyShare Software to download pictures.  This is a HUGE negative.  In the future, I will only buy cameras that show up as removable storage drives when plugged into a computer.  2) Video is stored in Apple Quicktime format (*.mov).  The is also a huge negative.  The codecs for this format are not widely available for application integration.  You have to download and use Apple Quicktime to view them.  You can not view the videos in Windows Media Player.  It is also not compatible with some photo-album software.  I would only buy cameras in the future that have an option to store video in a non-proprietary format.  Update:  After review, I have found that WinXP and Vista plug-n-play with the camera when it is plugged into the USB port.  It does not work on Win2k.  Thanks for the comment that made me double-check 
 This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next.  However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives.  A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband?  It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research.  That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book.  I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it.  It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure 
 of us who don't care to be grossed out I want to warn that this book is not for all Christians. It had quite a bit of unacceptable crudeness 
 As previous reviews have pointed out the mix on this cd is absolutely horrible.  The guitar is so muddy it's flat out annoying to listen to.  Someone either didn't know there was a treble knob on the amp, tone knobs on the guitar or how to operate a mixing board.  Go get Pat's early solo cd's like El Hombre or East; you can't go wrong with either one.  Producers and engineers of today's jazz music could learn alot by picking up any of Rudy Van Gelders engineered Blue Note and Pretige recordings 
 I put off writing this review for a while, because I really love the Cake Doctor books, which are just fantastic, and didn't want to say anything that would hurt Ms. Byrn's feelings--she seems like a pretty cool chic.  This book, however, was a major disappointment.  I made several recipes from it and I'd say three out of four got two forks way, way down--my family did not like them at all.  The other reviewer that says she depends a lot on soup and cheese, half and half is accurate.  If I wanted such meals, I'd just zip on over to Cambells.com and save myself the cost of the book.  I didn't find anything in here that my family was glad to see again aside from the Ham-and-Cheese Impossible Pie, which I found out was pretty well known elsewhere.    This book also has some pretty odd recipes.  It's sort of like she stuck to her own family's favorites that didn't translate well into other family's taste--their appeal is not nearly broad enough to justify their being included.  Creole Shrimp with Polenta, Curried Chicken and Artichoke Casserole might be favorites in her home, but I assure you they aren't in mine.  My family didn't even care for her Tuna Casserole.  I would recommend buying a book from people who write about dinner--mainly "Fast. Cheap. Good." by the Desperation Dinners writer, which also includes your grocery budget to boot (with chapters like "How To Eat On $100 a Week", how can you go wrong?). Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross cook meals that have a tried and true broad appeal, as they have a nationally syndicated column called Desperation Dinners.  With all the feedback a national column generates, their substance is tried and true with a broad appeal to all.  As a frugal mom with a limited budget and limited space for books, I regret this purchase and wish I could return it.  Sorry, Anne.  Stick to cakes 
 I've seen many films from all over the world including Bollywood but "Devdas" is in a class by itself as the most boring pretentious over -produced badly acted by any standards, so that even as self parody its ghastly - without subtlety or the rapturous extravagance one can enjoy in Bollywood films. Its two hours too long and the leads have the emptiest faces likely to be seen on the screen 
 While this book makes some interesting points it comes across more as an anti-tradition propaganda piece than a useful treatise on martial arts.  While the author is an experienced, highly knowledgeable practitioner, his understanding of the traditional martial arts that he rails against is incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate. Don't get me wrong; I certainly do not believe that the author is an idiot.  I believe that he is the victim of bad teaching, an all too common occurrence in martial arts.  For example, he states that, "today's full-contact fighters throw devastating, lightning fast punches from a distance of less than two feet.  Against this kind of speed, classical blocks and punches simply do not stand a chance.  What amazes me is how a flaw of this magnitude - and one that is taught to thousands of unknowing students every day - still exists in what are, otherwise, extremely potent arts..." This is just flat wrong.  Contrary to Mr. Orlando's understanding, in classical blocks the hand that is out (e.g. just punched or blocked) performs the actual block, check, or deflection, while the hand that is in chamber executes a technique designed to control the opponent's limb.  Even though it is often hidden, almost all blocks in traditional karate styles utilize this check/control methodology.  In all cases, there is never ever any "wind-up" preceding anything.  In most traditional schools all but the most junior students understand that simple fact.  To delve deeper, the word "uke" translates more accurately to "receive" than it does to "block."  When viewed in this context, it may be easier to understand that practitioners typically check, deflect, or control an attack rather than meeting it force-on-force.  Using the traditional check/control methodology, a practitioner's outstretched hand need only deflect an attack by a few inches to spoil its effect when contact is made close to an opponent's body.  In this fashion karateka can easily avoid being hit by even the most "devastating" of punches no matter how fast, or how powerfully, or even how unexpectedly they are thrown.  Common misconceptions such as this one are the reason that I believe it is imperative to supplement the traditional modeling approach to instruction with interactive discussions and other teaching styles.  Regardless, I hate to see this sort of stuff perpetuated...  Now that I've ripped him down, I will point out that there are some redeeming concepts in this book.  For example, the author also promotes practicing martial arts in the same sort of attire one might be wearing in real life.  If you have spent your whole life barefoot in a dojo, training with loose fitting clothes, you may well be in for a shock the first time you have to fight in tight-fitting jeans wearing boots.  This is a very valid point.  I wholeheartedly agree that practitioners should devote some of their training to more realistic conditions though that often must occur at their home rather than in a tradition karate school.  All in all, however, there is not enough meat in this book for me to feel like I got my money's worth from purchasing it.  It was disappointing. Get Sifu Orlando's book "Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals: The Brutal Arts Of The Archipelago" instead. It's a great read and well worth buying.

 I'm always amazed about people who study the Bible in order to find there errors. They have a lot to say, but it is vanity of vanities. If somebody cares about this topic, try to find "Forever Settled" by Jack Moorman. ISBN 1888328061 
 Even though this book is inexpensive, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. The job ideas are not inspiring, and not really up to date either. It barely skims the surface of what someone can do with an English major and/or writing experience, and never steps outside of the basic areas that you've probably already thought of yourself. It also doesn't give you a single idea as to how to break into any of the few jobs it mentions, if you happen to be looking for that kind of advice as well. Purchase something a little weightier and a little more expensive, it'll be worth it. This isn't 
 It is perfectly true that the problem the author describes exists.    I am the child of a dark-skinned black woman and an almost-white black man and I saw people look down upon and subtly denigrate my mother from the time I was a child.  I also saw her turn around and be incredibly abusive to my father and those of us children who were light-skinned in revenge every time this happened or when she even THOUGHT it was happening, making everyone in the house miserable.  And no one is writing books about the way many dark-skinned blacks, especially women, feel called upon to punish light skinned people just for existing-- I don't know how I got through elementary school, I was beat up every single day for being 'high yaller'--to some people there is nothing you can ever ever do to make up for this accident of genetics and if you are light-skinned the whole history of slavery and racism is your personal fault, even if you are only five or six years old. So the fault is on both sides, not just one, in my opinion and the best solution is to GET OVER IT; everybody has their issues and things that have happened to them.  I can't believe someone would waste time and write a whole book about this--and then claimed that they have actually moved on. I married a man who is as dark as my mother but is not interested in complaining about that (he likes how he looks and so do I) and who admires me for the person I am inside, not because I have green eyes or whatever else (which is so uninteresting, really, don't you think?)  I figured the best thing I could do to fix what happened to me as a kid would be to have kids and love them whatever color they turned out, and make sure they felt so good about themselves that they would have no need to pick on anybody else, and I can tell you, my three boys aren't even aware which one has so-called 'good' hair and which one is more dark--it has never been an issue in our house. As for my parents, my dad walked out on my mother after forty-one years of marriage one day after an argument in which she insulted him yet again--and shoved him in a swimming pool with his clothes on.  And, after  forty-one years, she claimed that he had finally walked out simply because he thought she was 'too dark'.  Is this a self-fulfilling prophecy or what 
 It is not the book I thought it would be.  Sorry I brought it 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 I'm very interested in homelessness and I enjoy social theory, but this book is far more academic than the description made it seem.  I couldn't get more than 20 pages into it without my head spinning.  If you are looking for something light this book is not the right choice 
 It is unfortunate that there is no good history of the Hmong published in any Western language.  Keith Quincy must be commended on his effort, but it is disappointing.  He is not a professional historian.  The first chapter  in particular, ostensibly dealing with the Hmong experience in China, shows  his unfamiliarity with Chinese history and inability to use Chinese  sources.  (The story of the "Hmong" king's defeat by China  actually concerns the conquest of the Jinchuan people, who were not Hmong.)   Quincy uncritically uses an unreliable account by F. Savina, _Histoire des  Miao_ (Hong Kong, 1924).  For a better study of Hmong in China see Robert  Jenks, _Insurgency and Social Disorder in Guizhou_ (University of Hawaii  Press, 1994).  The rest of the book is a little better, but must be read  with caution and cross-checked with other sources 
 The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.  Drop ya boots, dawg!!! I 
 I enjoyed Bangkok 8, so I decided this book would be worth a read.  The first half was very well done, albeit with a few annoyances (overruse of Farang, weak narrator voice, idiotic CIA characters), but it really deterioated once the tattoo artist came into the story.  The intriguing plot between Zinna and Vikorn was completely dropped.  And the last 50 pages were so ridiculous and uninteresting that it was only with great force did I finish the book.  Not reccommended. 
 The most surprising aspect of this 2006 thrill ride of a movie is that at ninety minutes, it is almost a half-hour shorter than its 1972 predecessor, a blessing really given that director Wolfgang Peterson seems only interested in filming the action sequences. An inspired choice for the remake, the veteran director has already proven a sharp acumen for providing exceedingly cramped, seafaring adventures with his classic WWII submarine movie, "Das Boot" and the more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong, "The Perfect Storm". The offsetting problem, however, is that Mark Protosevich's trite screenplay abbreviates character development in favor of banal dialogue and stock responses. The net result is that there is little concern for the fate of any of the characters, especially the women who look interchangeable when soaked, no matter how dire the consequences.  Peterson wastes little time, barely fifteen minutes, in setting up the ten key characters for the big tidal wave. From that point, he combines predictably spectacular CGI effects with outsized set pieces to dramatize the familiar journey this group takes to find their way to the hull where they seek safety. The one indisputable improvement over the original is the way Peterson effectively shows the fast elevating water level in a more realistic way, especially in having the characters swim a lot more through the submerged air shafts. Less realistic is the way all the characters appear to swim at Olympian levels in their ability to forego oxygen for lengthy periods. But the set-up gets repetitive, and the only diversion, albeit a minor one, is figuring out which character will be killed next.  As the alpha male, Josh Lucas cuts a reasonable action figure playing the Gene Hackman hero role though a more mercenary type given that his character is a professional gambler. Relegated to second lead, Kurt Russell seems to be inheriting Ernest Borgnine's role but not as a blowhard cop but as the sensitive former mayor of New York (huh?). They argue periodically about what path to take, but that's the only relationship that has any semblance to reality in the film. With no one as colorful as Shelley Winters or Stella Stevens this time, the rest of the actors barely register, including wide-eyed Emmy Rossum playing Russell's conflicted daughter and Jacinda Barrett as the brave mother of a predictably precocious son.  The biggest waste is the normally colorful Richard Dreyfuss cast rather pathetically as a gay, suicidal architect who barely says a word once the action starts. The climax gets quite convoluted in its technicalities, and then it simply ends. There are nine minutes of end credits at the end listing the multitudes who worked on the special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD is strictly for aficionados of this genre of film with several "making of" featurettes and a History Channel documentary which looks at the possibility of such waves wreaking such havoc. Surprisingly, there is little reference to the 1972 inspiration directed by Ronald Neame. And consequntly, there is barely enough to hold interest over the course of two discs. An unmemorable viewing experience overall 
 First let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract.   My conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics.   As others have said in this review forum. This book can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. I fail to see the "wit" in his endless negitivity and bashing.   This book has a few funny parts, but I cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. It is so unbelievible in places, that you know you are on an imagined tangent.   Dont waste your money or time. I am so happy I bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale! 
 I was expecting this to be a book about the monastic experience, but instead, it is a book mostly about Kathleen Norris, her life, and her social theories. There are a few nuggets of wisdom sprinkled here and there, but not enough to justify reading all the surrounding dross. Worse, there is no humility in the book at all.   Instead of being a seeker of wisdom who went into religion and then wrote about her experience, Norris seems to be merely a writer with a gimmick of hanging out with monks and nuns to get a good book idea. If you like that sort of thing, you may like this book, but you should know what you're getting before you buy it.  There is a hard edge to Norris's writing, an underlying anger and vulgarity. For example: "[N]ow we sigh, discouraged, hearing only the seeds of our well-worn, ludicrous sexual double standard which dictates that women must be either virgins or whores, either blessed or cursed, while men are simply sexual athletes." And: "That we all begin inside a woman and must emerge from her body is something that the male theologians of the world's religions have yet to forgive us for."   She uses the f-word, apparently just to shock readers and listeners, as when she notes with self-congratulatory satisfaction that after one such use her driver appeared startled because "[S]he apparently had heard that I was a religious writer." Well, regrettably, I had heard that, too.   There is far too little introspection in this book. Norris too easily criticizes others while failing to look at herself and while rationalizing her own behavior. Perhaps I have been spoiled by reading Henri Nouwen, who seemed to always analyze the nature of his own feelings instead of criticizing someone else who may have brought those feelings about. But then again, Nouwen was a person of admirable humility, a quality Norris needs to work hard to develop.  Norris has plenty of personal issues to deal with, as do we all. This book would have been much better if she had spent more time honestly wrestling with these issues instead of commenting on externals, offering social criticism and justifying her life as "a poet. 
 This isn't a very good book. It might be good if you're in love with history and you like reading 'Harriet freed slaves. She took them to Canada.' over and over again. Someone would read this and think Harriet Tubman was boring. If this is Harriet Tubman's life, then my life is cool. In other words,beware. This book is only for school reports. I wouldn't say this is a good book by any means. It's like being in slavery when you're reading this. I'd do math homework before this even crossed my mind 
 There's no sadder sight than a man attempting to drive a square peg into a round hole.  In this case, the hole is realism and the peg, the supernatural.  Haught, who should know better, attempts to impart an outline of evolution by natural selection through self-dialog.  His method is to place himself as a practicing Christian on the one side, and responding as a Christian historian of science on the other.  He is thus able to ask himself a series of almost pertinent questions [he never really poses the most important one] and respond in an apparently knowing manner.  The supernatural peg, however, cannot be driven into the aperture of reality.  With all his good intentions and carefully crafted words, Haught fails address the real problem.  The questions are reasonable enough, and often heard.  This assumed authenticity gives a patina of value to the book.  His opening salvo sets the tone, asking why evolution is "such a religiously troubling idea".  Haught's response is to simply negate that assertion with Augustine - change over time is possible.  Citing "Church Fathers" as authorities isn't a promising start.  He continues by examining "Darwin's Revolutionary Idea" [he doesn't concede Dennett's phrase until later in the book] as challenging traditional views.  Traditional, in Haught's view, doesn't mean "absolute".  That, of course, permits science, which Haught tries to admire through the book, to push his deity further away from human context.  In effect, this book, starting with Darwin instead of Copernicus, traces the displacement of "the Creator" from up close and personal to increasingly remote and detached.  Each question Haught poses is designed to drag the Desert Deity [just the one, please note] back into Nature's processes in some guise or another.  Even if it's no more than a "sense" or "presence", the deity must be acknowledged at some level.  It's hard to imagine a more contrived appeal to special pleading.   Haught wants to be considered an "authority" on natural selection by providing answers to his imaginary questioners.  He cites Gould, E. O. Wilson and, of course, de Chardin.  Even William Hamilton's shade is enlisted, to burnish Haught's certification.  Richard Dawkins and his "philosophical supporter", Daniel C. Dennett are grudgingly acknowledged a role in expounding on "Darwin's Dangerous Idea" - where we finally arrive on page 77 - but are dismissed as "atheists".  Dawkins, of course, becomes the bete noire of Haught's presentation.  Not only is Dawkins more insightful on how evolution works, he asks the question Haught ignores - where is the evidence for the deity?  Since Haught maintains evidence is irrelevant, we are left with him still pounding away at his supernatural peg.  In his struggle to convey his science credentials, Haught manages to answer most of his own questions wrongly.  In his struggle to confound his adversaries, he manages to misquote - or selectively quote - each of them.  His use of "buzzwords" as "scare flags" is constant, but intensifies when he perceives he's on weaker ground than usual.  As the book [and the questions] progress, Haught becomes ever more frantic to assert his case.  The deity is there, somewhere - it must be!  All we have to do is figure out where.  This is no roadmap either to understanding deities or natural selection.  To cap the string of inadequacies, Haught offers a "Selected Reading" list.  The hint is in the adjective.

 When The original "The Grudge" Came out. It was a shocking very scary experience at the theater. I was jumping in my seat. I saw the original when I was 16, up to that point it was one of the scariest movies I'd ever seen, and I've loved Horror/Scary movies since I was four years old.   I really like Sarah Michelle Gellar. I think she's a great actress and I always like her movies. I was a fan on "Buffy" So, I was excited that she would be in the sequel.   To my disappointment she had about 5 minutes of screen time in "The Grudge 2." I was really looking forward to the sequel. But, I was actually shocked at how bad it turned out to be. I really couldn't believe how terrible it was. It was NOTHING like the original "The Grudge" It lost all of it's spark. Not one part of the whole movie was even remotely frightening. NOT ONE PART.  "The Grudge 2" was the only movie in my entire life where I actually fell asleep in the theater. I never thought the day would come where I would fall asleep in the theater. It was that boring and uninteresting. Unfortunately, I didn't fall asleep for very long. I really tried to like this movie. I wanted to like this movie. But, I just couldn't. There were so many different ways they could have taken the sequel. But, they turned into something that could have gone straight to video.   The Japanese Version of the sequel was much better than this. If you must see it, rent it.  
 The "statistics" this book cites are more than misleading and do not reflect even a moderatly informed scientific opinion.  Schzophrenia and bipolar disorder have certainly been proven to be caused by brain abnormalities as have many other illnesses. To opine that psychiatry and successful treatment of these life-threatening conditions are some sort of huge hoax is akin to claiming that there's no such thing as mental illness. The medications available to treat major mental illness can be the difference between a happy, productive life, and a life of debilitating violence, despair, and death.  The authors' child-like descriptions of medical testing and - believe it or not - their entire section describing the personality of all pschiatrists (they are evidently all controlling, evil powermongers) - only serve to reinforce the authors' idiocy. Certainly, medical professionals have at times been responsible for misprescribing drugs - but to conclude that all psychopharmaceuticals are evil or that all psychiatrists are frauds is laughable.  I wonder if anyone's thought of suing the authors for the damage the book's lies may have caused in their own or a loved one's life 
 After using this case for a while, I found the top cover did not close properly as it did when I purchased it.  The top cover can either slip inside, or to the outside of the lip on the top left hand side of the case. I am referring to the small metal tab, that supports the case cover when closed, located to the left and above the Axim device lock button, when your Axim is in the case.  This poor fit causes the Axim to get squeezed a bit, at the point where the Axim microphone is.  The case is not properly designed to ensure that this pinching or squeezing does not occur.  The case also has no secure locking mechanism, to prevent the case from popping open if you should drop it.  This would potentially expose your Axim to screen damage 
 It's just that simple.  There is NO credible clinical evidence that chelation therapists do anything for patients except lighten their bank accounts.  If any chelation therapist wants to sue me for writing this, BRING IT ON!  
 Trash all the way.  The writers not only insult their characters but also readers who may find themselves and their style/taste looked down upon in the most offensive way.  Any book that insults and alienates it's readers in such way deserves one star, but the book also comes short in plot, character development and dialog.  Don't waste your money and time, if you must read chick-lit, you'll do much better with your money if you buy the B. Jones' Diary or the shopoholic series 
 The 6th edition of this text was released in 2005, but should be roughly 608 pages. This is listed as such in another listing under the same title, though the softcover info for this text also seems to be incorrect. If this is the correct text the list price is also significantly higher for new texts.  Double check before you buy ... though I tried and couldn't figure out how to do so 
 I looked all over for this duet and was somewhat disappointed that I paid over $10 for one 4 minute 22 second song. I thought it was a whole cd of Bing Crosby and David Bowie. At the very least the song should have been repeated for the whole cd 
 I work in finance and create many charts and graphs. I figured a book like this would help me to design them better. I was really looking for a practical guide rather than a long, rambling academic textbook, but that's how this book reads.   It seems aimed at college underclassmen rather than business professionals. Few spends page after page discussing the most basic mathematical concepts and things that you simply don't need to know in order to create a graph. For example, there is an entire chapter on basic statistics such as how to calculate a mean, median and mode. There is also a lengthy discussion of how the human eye works.  As I went through the book I found myself thinking: "Wow, Few has so little to say about tables and graphs that he needs all of this filler material to make this seem like a real book!"  There are some valuable chapters at the end of the book, but it takes a lot of patience to get there.  The page format is also really annoying and too textbook-like. It is a really wide book with citations (90% of which seemed to be from Tufte) in the wide margins.  I give this review one star for the 15 or so pages worth of good advice it contains. Unfortunately that wasn't enough content to warrant an entire textbook If you're a business professional looking for something you can use, this book is VASTLY overpriced and oversized.  My final comment is on the cover: An eye. A Brain. A sun. Bars coming out of each. It says very little to me, and that seemed to be the theme of the book. I wish I'd have seen a real review on this book before I shelled out $30.   
 This is one of those books that appeal to the pretentious.  The author is self-conscious and clever and has obviously written it with literary critics and English teachers and the sort of pseudo-intellectual that hangs out in New York cafes in mind.  The actual story was the last thing on his mind and it shows--the whole thing is a pastiche with what plot there is used to parade his annoying characters (Camus or Satre heroes in Victorian dress) and to make annoying observations (all the last word in philosophy circa 1960 but really dull in 2006).  Nothing could be more contrived than the alternate endings that one must pick from.  The reader does not want to pick an ending, to be truthful, because the author has not made the reader CARE.  I think I will continue reading actual Victorian novels, by the likes of Dickens, Trollope and Eliot rather than ever bothering to re-read this nonsense 
 I am not 100% sure, but at the time of the release of Sparkle, and upon its success, many whom has seen the movie screamed for the Original Soundtrack.  However it was rumored more than once that Lonette McGee was signed to a small independent record company at the time, and they would not allow any recordings to be released without them (record company) obtaining some monatary gains. Curtis Mayfield said no, and Wha-la, Aretha Franklin was chosen to sing on the album.  Yes I know she is  the Queen of Soul, but I always thought Original Soundtrack means the Original Songs, people whom sung them, and music exactly as it sounds in the motion picture.  Anything else is an re-enactment.  I like and R-E-S-P-E-C-T Aretha, but give me Lonette on this one 
 i was disappointed, many who i talked to recommended the Lorna Sass pressure cooking books. 90+% of the recipes were made with foods I would never consider eating. so for my family there may be 5 or 6 recipes that i would consider trying. if its made with foods they won't eat, then this cookbook was not meant for me. That's my opinion and i would guess that others find it very useful for them, but not for me 
 In "Iron John," Robert Bly announces that American men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness.  He illustrates his point with one of the Brothers Grimm's more obscure (and frankly less interesting) stories, interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point.  He also draws heavily on Freudian and Jungian theories.  He proves his point in the same way Freud and Jung proved theirs' i.e. by saying "This is what I see, I am the expert, so that makes it true, Occham's Razor be darned."  Bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions, nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or, heaven forbid, that his observations might be wrong.  For example, Bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 (conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion, despite his objective tone).  Bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true.  He does not consider that by age 35, most men have realized that they don't really want to be firemen.  Could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to (such as self-help books)?  Naw, it's gotta be that "dreams" thing.  Bly also describes a case where students during the Viet Nam war broke into their college presidents' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the CIA.  Bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures, because their fathers left home to work, preventing their sons from seeing how men work.  Bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger.  No, there had to be a "real" reason for the break-in, and aren't we lucky to have Robert Bly to tell us what it is?  Along the way, Bly overloads his writing with literary references, all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes.  It's all very pretentious, er uh, interesting, but so what?  I could interpret the same passages to mean something else.  If I lived at the time the passages were written, my interpretation would most likely be very different, despite Bly's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal.  Bly' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down, however.  It underscores what is wrong with his whole premise.  He tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact, but uses only subjective views (many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context) to support the idea.  Sorry Bob, you can't have it both ways.  One gets the impression that "Iron John" was cynically written to fill a niche.  Like all self-help books, "Iron John" targets a specific audience, tells them they are not happy, and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy.  Bly's target audience is White men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements.  If you do not need a political movement to define who you are, then "Iron John" is not for you 
 This was so stupid. Intelligent sharks that swim in schools terrorize a local tourist beach community. Complete with direct rip-0ffs from "Jaws," and combined footage of real sharks with plastic and inflatable toy sharks. Also the shark thinks it's a lion as it growls before and during attacks. People underwater with scuba gear can talk, and scream easily too..Hmmmm..LOL..If you like bad films, you might wanna see how stupid and cheap this is. There is plenty nof unintentional humor here. But I cannot give it any better than 1 star. Because that's what it is. A one star mega low budget film. Bad actors. Bad script. Bad director. Bad special effects. But if you hate bad movies, stay away... Truly for lovers of below "B" grade films only 
 I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand.  I would not purchase this item again. I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work. 
 This book is a quick, fast, read that will take no time to finish.  It is light and fluffy and it is an insult to any reader's intelligence, especially if they are from the South. The plot is the same old thing with words of stupid wisdom handed out by all of her characters. Oh, and let's not forget that they all grow and change from the one experience. This author is about telling stories to make money.  She adds in anything about the Southern culture she can think of.  The problem with that is she does not always know the culture, even if she grew up there.  The character details she threw at the reader towards the end made me just shake my head and say, "please give me a break!"  Anyone from the South would tell you that the matriarch of the family would never, ever disolve her membership to her church and say "I don't need a minister to help me speak to God".  The church is the social institution of the South.  If she was from such fine lines of Southern society, she would have been at church every Sunday in her very own, paid for pew.     The feeling that you get when you get towards the end is the author is trying to desperately end the story so she can meet her deadline and make her money.  I certainly am sorry I gave her mine.   
 I was excited to get this book, hoping for some great ideas for meals for one. Instead what I got was a book with plenty of "dip" recipes and salad dressing recipes. Also a section on the cooking of plantains. There is one recipe with beef (ground beef with frozen veggies... yum! not!) and one with chicken. Save your money and forget this book. I may just return it and get my money back. 
 The video is geometrically distorted, interlaced, has blown out contrast, almost no detail at all, and horrible sound. TransFlux Films should be ashamed for putting out such poor quality work, yet including a featurette on the cover designer.  Everyone should avoid this DVD and go for the BFI double feature with L'Age D'Or, which has a watchable Un chein andalou for a change. 
 I consider myself to be very fortunate to have discovered this band here on amazon in my quest to find comparable bands to Depeche Mode in that same vein of dark melodic synthpop. However I am even more fortunate to have chosen this album as one of the last and final additions to complete my De/Vision collection because had I chosen this as my first exposure to the band, I might not have become a DV fan at all.  Looking past the intriguing cover art and amazing single spawned from it( Heart Shaped Tumor ), this album is terrible. You'd never know it to read the tracklisting, but tracks like "Silent Moan" and "Drowning Soul" are actually featherlight tracks full of optimistic and silly lyrics{"It's a beautiful world, we've got so much to do, this life is a grace, you know it's true" HUH?!?! This band did not come into popularity for making happy feel-good songs }and even weaker paper-thin synth beats. Do not misinterpret that I am just some gothic snob snubbing the band because they don't have their typical heavy doom and gloom dance sound. DV is perfectly capable of constructing a masterpiece of softer, more upbeat tracks and that is proven ten fold with "Devolution". Listening to this album almost makes me want to scream out in frustration! I can hear the lovely voice of the band that I've grown to love so much, still as true to form as ever, but the music, beat and lyrics sound so terribly cringeworthy that I would have never guessed that this indeed was DV if not for those familiar vocals.   Further disappointment is the 3 bonus tracks included on this US edition, as they are all tracks available on the "Heart Shaped Tumor" maxi single, which is an extremely better purchase as compared to this. "Two" would be best classified as a DV ballad album but don't expect anything remotely similar to the sweet emotional magnificence of previous DV ballads like "Dress me when I Bleed", "Moments we Shared" or "The Melody of your Face". With the exception of "All I ever do" and "Heart Shaped Tumor", and the 3 bonus tracks, which are all true to DV's masterpiece form and thus, achingly out of place here, this album is chock full of unispired melodies, dreadfully boring synths, and laughable lyrics. Even if these tracks were completely redone by the likes of such masters like VNV Nation, Mesh, or even Depeche Mode themselves, they would still fall short of what De/Vision is all about.   I feel that this album is for completists only. Those who want to own the quality bits of this album need only to aquire the "Heart Shaped Tumor" maxi single and download "All I ever Do". If you're starting from scratch then pick up "Zehn" ( a lovely singles compialation ) and anything from 1992-1998 for a taste of the classic dancable  darkpop sound. The rest of the newer albums are all great and worth owning for a mellower, softer DV sound. Check out "Void" if you're into the experimentation of guitars in the mix, "Devolution" for a GOOD enterpretation of more optimistic and upbeat songs and the full fruition of the 'ballad album' idea with "6 Feet Underground", which is what I feel the band may have been shooting for when they made this album. Thank Goodness they fully recovered and got that one bad album behind them 
 I carry my organizer with me. I purchased this in spite of its larger size because overall I liked the format and because of the menu, grocery, and to do lists.  As far as functionality goes, it would be nice to have some tabs (monthly or by section). Also, I agree with many other reviews on the 18-month format. Why print calendars that overlap year after year? I'm carrying around 6 months that I will have to replace and will throw away. It seems a gimick to add an extra 6 months that, IF you continue on with this calendar, you must purchase again (unless you choose to go without a planner for 6 months every other year!)  Also, I wonder why they couldn't bother to put an attractive cover on the thing. If I carry this with me I'll be looking at these peole I don't know (and carrying around a big ad) for 18 months! Maybe a tear-off with Amy's picture if they must and then the permanent cover below; something more subtle, like most other famiy calendars. I liked how the familytime.mine has a variety of covers to choose from and am considering replacing this one with it 
 My 3yr. old loves My Little Pony, so I bought this DVD...She asked me to turn it off because it was scary. I also, was disapointed when I got it in the mail and saw that it was made in 1986 and on the descrition it said 2006.   
  From an archaeologist's point of view, that the "artifact" used for show and tell is a wood hoop with strings (and would not be preserved in most archaeological contexts) is the minor problem. The major problem is that Great Aunt Jane, the archaeologist, has an "artifact" in her trunk instead of in a curation facility.  Ethical archaeologists do not keep the artifacts they find.  The book could have Arnold find a replica made of one of Auntie's discoveries. In its favor, the book does emphasize "it's not what you find [i.e. the artifact] but what you find out" that's important 
 Besides this book, I purchased at the same time The Insiders' Guide to Baltimore, which is $2.00 more and 150 pages longer.  I give this City Smart guide 2 stars, compared to a 5 star rating on the Insiders' Guide.     The reason for the wide difference in rating the two books: This book, City Smart, is trying to be hip, flippant, and tounge-in-cheek.  Instead, it comes off as very negative.  I purchased the two books at the same time, read this one first, and when I was done I really wasn't sure I wanted to visit Baltimore.      And that would be a mistake because Baltimore is indeed Charm City, and the other book really brings that out.  It has a much more upbeat, positive, optimistic, good-natured style; as well as more depth and details in the extra 150 pages.       The Insiders' Guide was true to the Baltimore I discovered, this City Smart guide was off-putting and off the mark 
 I think I always had a soft place in my heart for the Jewish people long before I became a Christian.  After accepting the Lord as my Savior, that softness flamed into  love for these children of Jacob/Israel because out of their ancestral line came Jesus and because they preserved the very word of God.  Parts of Brown's book, I found very troubling.  Mans' inhumanity to man is gut-wrenching; we are capable of  horrific things.  What was not brought out in the book is an explanation - not an excuse - why people did what they did.  Anti-semitism and any other anti-something - even anti-Christianity - must be taught to tender ears and moldable hearts -  the uninformed, ignorant and child-like (no matter what age)- by the biased, hate-filled and spiritually blind. In our falleness, hatred is a language we seem to grasp well while love seems mostly limited to a few of our own if they meet our expectations and standards.  I agree with Mr. Brown that the church 'visible' needs much to seek forgiveness from the Jewish people but what puzzles me is "Jewish people by their own teaching say only the victim can accept forgiveness". How then does this forgiveness happen ?   And so, in joy, I turn to the gospel of Christ as the only viable peace offering not by broken man but by a loving God.  The gospel is the only channel by which God touches our hard hearts and breaks down the wall between gentile and Jew and makes one new man.  Only through God's power can one sincerely seek for forgiveness and can forgiveness be accepted in humbleness.  This is the church 'invisible' and it is alive and growing.   In areas of the world where authentic Christianity is lacking, anti-semitism thrives.  My greatest prayer for the Jewish people is that they may see Jesus as their Messiah and that gentile and Jew can worship together in Spirit and truth.  To God be the Glory for His Son: the Prophet Moses spoke of, the King promised David, and our High Priest, in the order of Melchizedek, who intercedes for us unlike any other 
 This otherwise acceptable collection of essays is diminished only by an introduction which lacks insight or analysis, and simply reads the imaginitave and controversial interrogations of the subaltern collective as an extension of british marxist writing.  This type of jejune connection, unfortunately, is typical of the Verso mindset, and belongs truley to the dustbin of historical writing 
 I was very curious about this book, because John Harris runs the best political journalistic operation the business at the Washington Post and Mark Halperin runs the smartly written but nauseatingly cynical "The Note."  Would it be full of the blunt but smart analyses I see in the Post or the snarky, generally pro-Republican stuff you see in The Note?  The answer is a mix.  On the one hand, you have pages upon pages of sucking up to Drudge, Limbaugh, and the rest of the right-wing noise machine.  On the other, you have real bombshells, like the admission that press crew who travelled with Gore (specifically, Kit Seelye and Ceci Connelly) may have cost Gore the 2000 presidency.  In the end, I find this tremendously disappointing: two writers with amazing access and great political acumen for the most part waste their time pulling their punches about the press corps and how it operates.  That said, I would have given this a higher rating were it not for two factors: (1) the fact that neither will admit that their own news operations are to a certain extent responsible for the power of what they call the "Freak Show" and (2) the excessive worship of Clinton and Rove, neither of whom is the political genius they are made out to be here (in my opinion).    And there's one other thing: I find Mark Halperin to be a deeply troubling figure, both here (in the passages that are clearly his) and in The Note.  Clearly intelligent, he seems motivated primarily by the desire to curry favor with the powerful.  He, and people like him, are a large part of the reason why we now have political dynasties, such as the Bushes and Clintons, which we never had before in the history of this country    I think that if Harris -- whose other writing I admire greatly -- had written this with a different partner this might have been a great book.  Instead, what it is at some level is a brilliant mistake 
 Okay. Me and my friends are ALWAYS looking forward to the new clique books.  But this was a big let down.  I mean, a SECRET ROOM??? How unrealistic.  And this is one of those series that you always feel implied to read, even if everyone says it sucked.  The plotline has a serious lack of spark, and I feel that this was definitely not her best. But if you want a REALLY good series, Private, by Kate Brian, is AMAZING.  She constantly has you on the edge of your seat and you will love it. I guarantee it. < 
 I don't even know where to start with this, and I have to admit that despite several attempts, I only made it through 110 pages and couldn't stomach any more. Based on the first 110 pages, one of the main characters, Augusta, is so snide and rude and intolerant of anyone who believes or thinks differently than she does, that she seems more like a 13-year-old brat than an adult woman. The author clearly has issues with religion and makes every religious person in the book a caricature and portrays the people who are basing their lives on the occult as the "wise" ones. And even given that conservative-bashing and Christian-bashing is what all the "popular kids" are doing in our society, I will say that even the author's characterization of Augusta is extreme. This novel just didn't appeal to me at all 
 This is a tough read. If you wanted an interesting book about Eninem's rise to popularity and behind the scenes dirt on how Dr Dre discovered and nurtured his raw talent, then don't buy this one because this book has NONE OF THAT! Instead, every chapter is a dry account of how Eminem's music affects American society, media and culture. Really dull stuff. He even manages to make the history of rap sound boring. I've read 18 books this year but could not get through this one. The author writes for Rolling Stone and it shows... If you've ever picked up a copy of Rolling Stone and were bored to tears by the over analyzation of music and its social impact, track-by-track, then don't buy this book 
 This film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film, and has many flaws:  a silly plot, cheap religious imagery (Dracula is Judas, jeez louise), and not one truly sexy or scary moment. And it wastes three gorgeous gals as Dracula's brides, including Jennifer Esposito & Jeri Ryan. If you can't make a film sexy with these two, you're in the wrong business. Craven has an over inflated rep as a director, he doesn't deserve any rep as a producer, if this leaden film is a sample. It makes the worse Universal horror film look like Citizen Kane in comparison.  Save your money and pick up something scary instead, like Bava's Black Sunday or any Hammer horror 
 Instead of "every kind of writing," the subtitle should say "fiction and personal narrative." Some of the big names have interesting things to say, but this book is mostly little-known short story writers telling you that Mark Twain is great, people in their families were great story tellers, well-developed characters in stories are important, read a lot, humor writing doesn't get the respect it deserves, and then again, Mark Twain is great. And, that you can't have great humor writing without great writing, but there's plenty of mediocre writing in this book, like too many cutesy parenthetical asides.   There are some interesting points here and there, but the price of a used copy will be more in line with the book's value. 
 From the favorable reviews, I assumed that this would be an informative book.  However, this is not the case.  I learned very little in the course of reading the book, and here is why:  The laws are obvious.  Anyone who has ever been part of a team and given even a little thought as to what elements make a team function well will be unsurprised by the list.  The reason that the author says the laws are "indisuptable," is that the laws are so obvious that anyone can see that they seem to generally hold.  Don't waste your time with this book.  Instead, check out "First, Break all the Rules," which is an innovative work that addresses management issues (including teamwork) 
 I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  : 
 I have to say that I am not familiar with any of the old Shaft episodes, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of Shaft prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed! The acting is about average with the exception of Samuel Jackson who carries out his performance very well (as always), and Jeffrey Wright who really steals the show as Basquiat, the gangster.  Regarding the plot, it is weak; the chances that the character, Walter Wade Jr., would provoke and then deliver as he does are way beyond "slim!"  The desperate need to demonize what W.W. Jr. represents gets tiring after the first 1000 or so movies!  Enough is enough!  The same applies for main characters with "chips on their shoulders!"  Let's move on please! As for having Vanessa Williams (who is GORGEOUS!) play in this film and not have a single nude scene (in this R Rated movie!) with her is such a WASTE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. 
 I bought this book because I became curious after reading the various posted reviews. I do Yoga occasionally, and I was lucky enough to find an excellent book when I was 14 (over 25 years ago...), which was written by a Briton who was extremely balanced, pleasant, and clear in his writing. I cannot say that this book had the same effect on me. I found the author of the secret art rather pompous and arrogant and, in the circumstances, this made it harder for me to take seriously the whole book. While the movements make a nice workout, which I have no doubt can be healthy and cleansing of both mind and body, the messenger is not a very good advertisement. Making fun and speaking with such superiority about everything that is not the secret art, and accusing just about everybody of being superficial and stupid (unless, of course, one practices the art) suggests to me that the art in question has not really worked its magic on this teacher. Giving advice about being tolerant and well-disposed towards others sounds pretty moot, coming from this source. I gave the book two stars because of the practical part, even though I found some of the explanations of the movements rather wanting, although overall clear enough 
 Takes a long time to say nothing much...wish I had saved my money. I bought this because it was required for a class, but it's of very little real use for actually managing anything 
 I purchased this item recently at a local Radio Shack because it was on sale for $7.99.  In my case, I did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered, but I did get a disappointing one.  I use an older CD writer (NEC NR-7800A) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16X, and I have achieved that speed with other media (notably Imation).  In my system, however, these Sony discs are limited to a maximum of 8X no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used.  Either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive.  On the positive side, all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my DVD-ROM drive, DVD player, and CD player.  There's no point in buying this Sony product when there are so many others out there.  Find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it.  UPDATE:  The current model number on Sony's web site for the 50-pack CD-R spindle is 50CDQ80LS3 (not 50CDQ80LS2).  If you still want to buy Sony, try to find the current model number 
 The first two books in this series (Outfoxed and Hotspur) were great--I couldn't put them down!  And God knows I've stayed up way past my bedtime on a work night so I could finish a Mrs. Murphy story.  But this one?!  Slow cannot begin to describe it!  What a big disappointment!  
 This is one book that I would not recommend to anyone.  The author had so many character and so much detail that I could not even get past page 55.  All the characters in the book seem to have nothing to do with each other  and it got to the point that I did not even want to try to read the book  anymore 
 Neither even the stellar acting of the great actors William Defoe and Christopher Walkin, nor the nearly continual gratuitous sex that permeates throughout, could save this boring film nor its weak plot. The sex scenes, which are numerous and ordinarily include several women at once, were actually well done though peculiarly uninteresting.  Walkin and Defoe are on their game, and nearly make it a worthwhile viewing, but the script writer and the director were both asleep at the wheel.  As a science fiction film, it contains nothing interesting either. The story is boring, and plods through irrelevant scenes. I had high hopes for this film; thinking it was similar to 'Blade Runner' and possibly half as good. After watching the first few minutes, I was minded of 'Liquid Sky'.  However, it wasn't even half as good as 'Liquid Sky', and that is not a great film either, but at least it held the viewers interest.  I wouldn't suggest purchase of this film to anyone who hadn't seen it first, and then only if they didn't fall asleep 
 As a Witch, I have no desire to read about biblical recipes or lore in a book billed as a Witch's Cookbook. Apart from this, the recipes are mediocre and written in a style best suited for the reader on prozac. 
 the most disappointing so far in the 'popular culture and philosophy' series, these essays have little to do with either LotR or Philosophy in the traditional sense, instead attempting to cover everything from environmentalism to narrative structure. As a general format, the authors state their intentions to mold Tolkien's world to their own pet ideas and quote profusely while saying little that convinces. One of the essays even admits that the Buddist parallels it's spent the last few pages proposing are clearly "superficial" - why waste the print, then? Another oddity here is a collection of quotes by various noted philosophers that have nothing to do with either the themes in LotR, or, in many cases, the topics the essays address. Extremely discouraging 
 The text is meticulously researched and Jay is knowledgeable, but his writing style,sadly,is so turgid as to be unreadable.  There is hardly a sentence that isn't footnoted and cached with trendy academic jargon, so that to be properly understood one would have to have the book reproduced with hypertext and the reader spend most of his time in the references.  Art history isn't exactly General Relativity or is it 
 The Frosts' version of Wicca is atheistic and almost Satanic (LaVey version) in its utter selfishness.  Use Wicca (by which they really mean witchcraft, since they provide no belief system or ethics) to do any damned thing you please!  Why not?  After all, it's all about you.  And them, and their School, which they call a "church" for no discernible reason.  However, if you can't give over an entire room of your house to practice, and decorate said room with a permanent symbol drawn to specifications on the floor according to an exact ink recipe that includes your own blood, then "you can't do Wicca".  Awwwwww.  At least this one doesn't include instructions for ritual child rape.  Sheeeeeesh! 
 How can you even have a hits cd considering they had no decent music or hits to begin with?  I listened to the entire cd and couldnt find a single song worth listening to for more than 8 seconds.   This CD is full of horrible songs and now i have to have surgery to stop my ears from bleeding 
 For someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science, Stephen Jay Gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book. Gould rambles on and on, attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton, and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. For anyone who has no knowledge of biology, this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science. Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him, and it would be best if he, as well as all other crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics, stay out of it 
 For those that waited all these years for a sequel to the classic American Werewolf in London, the wait is not over.  American adventurers looking for thrills across Europe decide to bungy jump from the Eiffel Tower.  But there is a beautiful woman who is going to commit suicide by jumping.  One of the boys jumps to her rescue.  But her secret is she is a werewolf and accidentally infects him.  Well, it turns out that there is a pack of werewolves in Paris and they feed on Americans. (Let's talk obvious stereotyping.)  While at times it is good (especially when Julie Delpy is on screen).  Don't waste your time watch the original!! 
 I can't believe anyone would even charge money for this "map"!  It's like a handout you would get at a mall.  Poorly done, and minimal information.  
 We loved this pot when we bought it.  The design, the taste and temperature of the coffee;  but like everyone else our joy was short lived.  The cheap plastic top snapped off after 3 months. I have not contacted the company, but I will be doing so shortly. I wish I had read these reviews before I went shopping. 
 Did I expect too much?  I anticipated so much more from Douglas Gresham.  Was he writing for children?  Even children deserve to be treated as if they could understand words of more than one sylable.  Presumably many people who would be interested in reading about C. S. Lewis have some knowledge of the man, this particular book was entirely too condescending.  Who needs to have definitions of simple words explained? In addition, there was almost nothing new in this description of Lewis.  I hardly categorize it as "biography"; more an effort to sell yet another book given the hype over recent notice of Lewis' works.  I could not recommend it in good conscience. Voracious Reade 
 I'm a big fan of movies along this line of story telling.  I can also appreciate a low budget movie. I am quite fond of and I own many B movies.  That in mind... avoid this unless it is the final piece in the collection you just have to complete!  Crow-Salvation was one of the best follow ups to the original. The Prophecy series is decent even up to #5. Wicked Prayer tried to open a new angle within the premise of the storyline and it just wasn't pulled off well. The "Demon Worshippers" were not believable.  This would have been disappointing if it had been an episode of Buffy. Higher budget on the Buffy by the looks of it 
   Irvin Matus wrote the definitively researched text on Shakespearean authorship  (Shakespeare, In Fact), and the Earl of Oxford fails completely as an alternative Bard. I wouldn't go around quoting Anderson's theories in the presence of anyone familiar with Matus' evidence. You'll get your head handed to you on a platter. Guaranteed. It won't be a fair fight 
 When a spoiled young rich girl turns up dead from an overdose, it touches Bruce Wayne in ways that few can understand. And when a mother pleas for the return of her missing daughter, Batman takes on the girls cause as his way to help the young girl who is already dead. But, there's more going on than meets the eye, and even Batman's old enemies are running scared. Just what is going on in Gotham City?  OK, where do I start with this one? Overall, I found the artwork to be very good. The fly in the ointment is the story, which is terribly convoluted. And the worst of it is that Batman is up against a new and terrifying opponent, but for the life of me, I can't figure out who it was or what they wanted.  So, I must agree that this is not a very good Batman graphic novel. It *could* have been, and more's the pity. I do not recommend this book 
 Not the type of music I had envisioned...much slower than I was hoping for. 
 Much too rough and dry for our baby.  If you want to find good baby wipes I recommend the Pampers Sensitive wipes which are soft and moist. 
 It does discuss a variety of alternative treatments for MS, but pretty well dismisses them all as either 1) ineffective but harmless or 2) ineffective and dangerous 
 i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally 
 Some deluded person with bad hearing compared James Blunt to Tori Amos. Hardly. He was lucky with 'Beautiful'. Listen closely- that sucks too! The ramblings of an emotionally desperate middle school student. I rue the day she made eye contact with James. This album is like hummingbird nectar- lotsa sugar but no substance. I hate that I was tricked into buying it. I hate that James Blunt took 80 minutes of my life that I will never recover. I was so hopeful when I bought it. Bottom line: Melodramatic lyrics coupled with uninspired music. Skip it 
 This book gives plenty of background into international finance.  Unfortunately, it has some big flaws, in my opinion.  First, there are not enough calculation examples.  Second, there are too few questions at the end of each chapter.  In addition, you must go to the author's website for the solution.  Once you get there, you will be surprised to find out that the author has only solved maybe two out of eight problems.  That's annoying.  I do not recommend this book.  Take a class from another professor who uses a different text book 
 This book's suggestions are simple, basic and despite that, not deeply explained. They seem to be aimed at big city apartment-dwellers, but no such 'disclaimer' is stated. Thankfully, I checked this book out of the library rather than spending money on it. Do yourself a favor and buy another book with some meat to its frugal suggestions 
 We have to use this book for the college class that I'm taking and it is a horrible book. I often find myself looking for help on the internet rather than going to this book. It is poorly organized, I have to go to the index in order to find something I specifically need because the book isn't in any order. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Find another there are many more 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.  If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read "The Coffin Dancer" instead 
 Set in modern times, Mona Simpson's fictional book Anywhere But Here takes us through a mother-daughter relationship full of disagreements and misunderstandings.  Adele, Anne's mother, pressures Anne to look beautiful and thin so that she can become a notorious movie star in Hollywood.  Even though Adele has high aspirations for Anne, she can't quite seem to live teh life that she has in mind.  She is consistently trying to find "the perfect father" for Anne but comes up short after many different dates.  Adele finally decides to take Anne to California and eagerly searches for movie shoots and jobs for her daughter.  This whole ordeal of becoming famous is seen throughout the book but in the end Anne is just a normal child and her mother is left wondering why her idea of Anne becoming famous never was fulfilled.                                                           Even though the plot is intriquing, it is quite drawn out.  The sentences flow well with one another and are quite poetic and  colloquial.  But the prolonged story makes the whole readability  of the story difficult.  While reading through the book, we as readers are left wondering why some scenes are even inserted.  Many of the scenes are distracting as well as unnecessary.             Mona Simpson's writing style also affects the overall readability of Anywhere But Here.  Her chapters jump from character to character, letting us see the different views of each of the characters on specific events.  However, most of the chapters are seen through Anne's unemotional viewpoint.  Carol, Adele's sister, also plays part in a few of the chapters, describing Adele's past life and attempting to demonstrate to us as readers why Adele acts in the manner in which she does.  Adele has one chapter in the end which is, unlike Anne's, full of emotion.  As readers we are left confused as to why Simpson doesn't add as much emotion into Anne's character.  As Simpson jumps from character to character, she also skips from year to year ignoring chronological order.  This makes for a hard-to-understand organization of stories.  One minute we think that Anne is an eighteen-year-old woman and the next we find out that she is only a twelve-year-old child.  Not only that, sometimes Simpson doesn't even mention the age and we are left trying to decipher Anne's age by Simpson's inferring style.           Overall, the book depicted a real-life situation that most everyone can relate to but the storyline was really difficult to follow.  I would suggest watching the movie before the story because you may begin the book but find out that you are unable to finish it due to the difficult storyline 
 I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves 
 Wow, I am amazed at the allure the Brain Bio Center still has after all these years. Its very existence seems to be hotly contested in this forum. Please allow me to settle this question once and for all. My Mom was a patient at the BBC and a former neighbor was an employee. However before I go any further, I should say that despite the "Princeton" attachment, BBC was never affiliated with Princeton University, which has no medical school. It wasn't even within Princeton's city limits; it actually was located in neighboring Montgomery Township (Skillman). But that is not surprising. Entities from churches to multi-million dollar companies who are physically in other municipalities have added "Princeton" to their names and/or rented PO Boxes to obtain a Princeton mailing address just to cash in on the prestige of the Princeton name. This is a very common practice in Central New Jersey. It is all marketing, hype, and horse feathers.  Anyway, the Brain Bio Center has been OUT OF BUSINESS since the early 1990's. Why? Many insurance companies labeled BBC's methods "alternative" (read: questionable) and therefore refused to cover them. Most folks could ill afford to pay cash. BBC just couldn't survive. Carl Pfeiffer died in 1988, and his cohorts have since opened an institute in his name (also in Skillman) that carries on his work.  I am not particularly interested in debating the merits or demerits of Orthomolecular Medicine. But I cannot refrain from one observation. The prevailing attitude regarding mental illness here appears to be "take a pill (or vitamin) and that will fix everything." Any mental health professional of worth would say that is a dangerous belief. Mental illness is much more complicated than that and requires more than simple chemical treatment. Been there, done that. Don't forget too that all kind of nutty treatments for mental illness and other things have come and gone through the years. Exercise good caution and get multiple opinions before you agree to the treatment of anything.  In any case, don't forget this book is 17 years old--long before Al Gore invented the Internet ;-). We have learned so much about medicine and ourselves since then. Try to look for more up-to- date stuff, for comparison if nothing else.  Therefore, I am giving this book one star, for being as obsolete and irrelevant as my long-discarded Commodore 64 
 Boring!! I was disappointed.  In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book.  That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around.  I just could not do it with this book 
 My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book.  His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........   Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed?  Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest.  Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church.  God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal.  Maybe he was abused by a priest 
 I bought the Meade CaptureView 8X42 1.3MP Digital Camera Binocular. The first one had software / hardware that hung up after 3 pictures, the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable, the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box. A truely tatty product 
 Was very disappointed by the performance of this unit.  Not enough pressure.  Pretty useless even with new batteries 
 If you're looking for the original versions of Black's classics like "Smokie" or White Silver Sands," stay away from this CD! All of the so-called hits presented on this CD are stereo re-recordings of the original mono hits; I suspect most of them were recorded long after Bill Black's death in 1965.  The new recordings have the same arrangements as the old ones, and have great sound, but the feeling of the originals is totally gone. Stay away from this CD 
 This book has little to do with Project Management and nothing to do with extreme project management. It is full of cliche ideas and not very useful banter.     Save your money it is not worth it 
 I'm sorry, I couldn't get past the horrible narration and annoying music to enjoy the purpose of the book. Hopefully the written word is much better as the other two reviewers have stated 
 How is it possible for an author to write such a great book and then completely destroy it all in the last 100 pages? I loved the characters, the nostalgia, the mystery until Madeleine grew up. Then I hated the characters. Every bit of love and charm was completely blown away. A loving marriage completely fizzles, a precocious and charming little girl becomes an obnoxious and self-absorbed adult. Friendships and families destroyed. Yea, yea. I know. It's all because of the murder, right? Whatever... And speaking of the resolution of the murder mystery. Are you kidding? If you choose to read this book, read until Madeleine grows up then skip to the end where the murder mystery is resolved. Use your own imagination to fill in the gaps. Better yet, stop BEFORE Madeleine grows up and "finish" the rest yourself. 
 I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.    The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.  The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.  1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.  2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making "S" sounds sound more like "H" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.  3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).  I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs.  
 The title says it all--except that it is largely about the Good Ol' Days in New York City. The title of the book promises more, and its tight focus on the Big Apple is not only a disappointment to readers expecting a broader treatment, but also makes the 'Ol Days less relevant to the general reader. It is the disappointed expectations that cost it three stars. This one definitely goes to the used book shop 
 Very satisfied in receiving the Holmes fan before the scheduled date.The fan was very easy to put together and take apart.  The noise level was too loud.  It does not tilt more than a inch and oscillates only 5" left and right of center.  I had to return this item.  I do not recommend this fan. 
 this film was pretty lousy and boring.  some big game hunter guy or something has this guy gets one of the snakes the python and is going 2 release it somewhere so he can hunt it.  but of course them snake gets loose.  wat a surprise.  so he finds out it got away and he and some other people go hunting it.  then their is another group of people trying to catch it as well and kill it.  one of the other persons has a 100 foot boa at his little aquaium or something and they let it go to try and catch the python.  but the boa starts mating with the python and they become friends and start eating all the people.  but the start to fight each other when the python eats 1 of the eggs.  there was 1 good thing though, the blond was very interesting to look at and thts rely the only reason i stuck around to watch this movie.  this movie rely had no plot and bad acting and horrible cgi effects.  dont waist ur time watching this movie 
 This book is awful.  The blurb makes it sound like a story of ostracism in high school, but the characters are cardboard-flat. It's more of a preachy spiritual trip for the author than a story.  There's no reason for the narrator, Justin, to befriend the school outcast (who is a Christian-raised white boy trying to live as a Buddhist monk). The narrator's friends are bratty and too obviously shallow. The school bully is a stock stereotype who does all the predictable bully things. I got about halfway through and quit. 
 but this still would not make up for the disarray this book is in.  The author has a lot of interesting information, but "Tomorrow's Energy" (TE) is very poorly compiled and editted, making it very difficult to read or skim through. I have another book I would recommend in place of this one, but I will hold off until the end of this review because TE should be fully addressed.  There is almost no foresight in this book. TE reads almost like hydrogen is just a fuel of the past when in fact many of us hope and expect it will one day be our fuel of choice. Even in the last chapter, "The Next 100 Years," the author just continues quoting away and giving speculation by others instead of reflecting on where hydrogen is going to go from his expertise (his perspective would have been nice since he has obviously done a lot of research on the topic).  The book reads like a collection of essays by the author on historical bits about hydrogen. Instead of telling us who did what on what date and here is what the person who did it had to say, it would have been far more useful to have the author explain in his own words what is going on and break the book into smaller sections if necessary (which really is necessary since there are so many random discussions it is painful).  Also, as "Slezak" mentioned, the units (GJ, BTU's, calories, you name it, it's in here) are flip-flopped throughout the book, making it incredibly difficult to follow the numbers, which is really relavent information to this topic.  The only type of person who will find TE useful over the book below is someone who wants to know a lot of details about the history of hydrogen and less about whether it will be useful for us in the future.  Now, my recommendation...  "The Hype about Hydrogen" (THAH), by Joseph Romm  THAH is still a little dry, but it does magnitudes better than TE, and it is consistent with units and has pretty clear descriptions. I couldn't put THAH down (I finished it in less than 2 days*), but after getting into TE about 100 pages, I dreaded going back to it. I made myself finish TE because I looked forward to what I expected to be the forward thinking last chapter (which, as mentioned above, was a great disappointment). *I'm a diligent (slow) reader 
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 I just finished this book and i don't really know if I liked the book overall. The book is too shallow, the story is just so so. There is nothing really exciting about the book. This is the first Lisa Kleypas book that I've read and I really rely in the ratings of the readers of course depending on the story also before I buy a book. This book have a good rating and definitely have a nice start to the story but after reading it, I am not having second thoughts about her books. I have other books of Lisa Kleypas and now I am hesitating to read them. 
 Danielewski is a little like "musician" Puff Daddy: he really does very little work on his own but is an expert at appropriating ideas from the avant-garde and then rearranging them in a comfortable, easily consumable form. "House of Leaves" has more in common with Stephen King than it does with Ballard, Burroughs, Poe, or even more radical artists who use the methods MD steals, like Samuel R. Delaney.  If having to turn a book while you read seems "cutting edge" or "daring" to you, then jump in. Otherwise, you should go buy some Jeff Vandermeer of China Mieville -- two artists less concerned with empty stylistic tricks and more focused on producing quality literature 
 This album contains a lot of experimental music, with a few early Talking Heads type songs sprinkled in.  If you like Brian Eno's experimental music, you will like this album 
 This is a book of Black Magic.  Do not be seduced into this type of foolishness.  Find the true Tantrism 
 Hi I'm Steven, I disliked this book for a number of reasons. It changed chapters to quickly, so it is hard to understand the life of Vinny and Li as a child growing up.  Once you start to uderstand what Peter Dickenson is talking about, he changes the chapters, so it makes it very very coppy, and  then you get annoyed becuase it keeps changing chapters, from Vinny's life  to Li's life, then back to Vinny's and then Li's you get the picture. And  Li changing evolution in about two years.(what I call the quicky  evolution)Li shouldn't think she is so different, all that happened was the  shark thing in the biginning of the book, and then the thing with the shell  at the end.  The Then story of the book ended really poorly, with she  turned the rock with the shell.  And the Now chapter cocentrated mostly on  her relationship with her dad, and not digging for bones and more important  stuff like that.  Actually I thought the Now chapter ended much better than  the Then chapter with Vinny finding the bone that Li had squished into the  end of the book, to end the Now chapter.  And that is my review of Bone  from a Dry Sea By Steven H 
 As much as I love Bleeding Through, this DVD came as a big disappointment.  The documentary drags on and on.  It does have its moments, however, and is fairly informative about the band.  My biggest problem with the DVD is the concert material.  The production of it was an absolute joke, looking and sounding like a typical ripoff bootleg that you'd find circling the Internet.  They even have a preceding introduction to the concert footage saying that there were "NO OVERDUBS, REMIXES, PITCH CORRECTION, AUTO TUNING, or 'CORRECTED' MISTAKES in the following recording.  It is raw and it is real."  As if giving it that X-TREEEME outlook is supposed to change the fact that the footage looks and sounds like utter sh*t.  They also censor the lyrics in their music video; what the hell?!  But it's a pretty affordable price, so I'd only recommed it if you want to learn more about this band 
 As long as its on, it will prevent scratches, but its tough to get off, and that act can scratch your laptop.  It scratched my Macbook when I pried it off.  The guy at the Apple Store who snapped it on a Macbook beause I requested a "demo", couldn't pry it off, and after 10 embarassing minutes, he called a colleague over, and they pried it off together.  And, to be honest, this makes the MB look ugly - kinda like putting a veil on a supermodel.  ;-- 
 I bought this Trendware TU-S9 couple months back. It was working great  except that I had to unplug the cable before hibernating my machine; otherwise the machine will hang during bootup. Today, Windows sees it as an "unkown device".  It was working an hour ago. I give it two stars for it is not very reliable - broken after rarely used for couple of months and that the cable needs to be unplugged before the machine is shutting down/hibernating. I would have given it four stars if it were not broken. By the way, my laptop is Dell Inspiron 6000. I haven't tried it on any other machine 
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
 My three year old loves this DVD and has discovered the joys of Goofy, BUT... Why can you just set the DVD to play all? The Mickey collection you can just set it and forget it. This collection you must keep selecting the next cartoon (it does not even default to the next cartoon). POOR SHOW DISNEY 
 I am the kind of person who cannot stand sustained negativity, so I never finished reading this book. I really think the author is a talented and smart person, and from what I hear from my parents I also think what she is telling is mostly true. But I feel sorry for her for what she must have suffered from her selfishness and her own negative view of everything around her. I used to be like that many many years ago and I know how it hurts. Anything has both good side and bad side. I think it's more healthy to remember what good things happened rather than how terrible things were which nobody can do anything about.  This book could be much better if the author had more sense of humor and described everything in a lighter tone. 
 This book attempts to "reboot" the continuity of several major characters by changing their backstory in midstream. Mr Feist is faced with the problem writers face when their major characters become too powerful (Both Pug and Tomas are almost gods). You end up just inventing more and more powerful adversaries. At some point it becomes both tired and ridiculous. This is way past that point. Yet somehow I still kept reading. Sigh. I am sure there are still Midkemia stories to be told. But vast end-of-the-world stories should not be one of them. After all, just how many times can Midkemia be threatened with "the end to everything" before it becomes just another yawn 
 Received this as a gift some time ago and after my son told me how much better fresh popped corn tastes I bought some popcorn, and buttery popping oil, both Orville's  Then I broke out the popper and followed manufacturer's instructions to the letter.  It popped the corn quickly, but it smelled funny and the popcorn was tough, chewy and tasted very stale.  I thought maybe it was because it was the first batch. so I popped another.  Same results.  Called my son to ask what I could be doing wrong, but he had no idea (he pops his on the stove).  I was planning on trying some different oil and popcorn, but then I read these reviews, so I won't bother.  At least now I know it isn't just me. BIG disappointment 
 I regret buying this book. It's not a guide for young people to starting your own business unless you call part time babysitting a business or selling your goods at a flea market as having your own business. The "businesses" the author has in mind are are, for example, selling homemade goods to your friends or anyone else you can get to buy them. If you call having a lemonade stand  a business, then this book may pertain to you 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 if you want to read an exceptional book saying the same things as this one but MUCH, MUCH better.   Mistry should be embarrassed to be writing, or rather re-writing, Midnight's Children with less spark, creativity, and far less to actually say. It is unoriginal!  Although this book is good, I frankly couldn't get past that I had JUST read the Rushdie previous to this book and felt like Mistry should have been chastized rather than lauded for putting this book out.   Oprah should pick up the Rushdie too 
 Roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free-trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better.  Based on the theories of David Ricardo, the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible.  In The Choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt CEOs.  Fables like The Choice (or the "free-market economy" for that matter) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple.  That's why the book is dangerous.  The Choice has almost nothing to do with the real world, but it sounds good.  The argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable.  If you buy Roberts' version of Ricardo, however, you must accept Wal-Mart as the epitome of business virtue.  Roberts may be a great guy, and he certainly writes well.  Unfortunately, his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple, elegant, and horribly wrong 
 The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to "preserve the life that is dear to him."  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of "24," but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write "Sunday," we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne 
 I thouht I'd like this book, what with all the good reviews and my love of English mysteries. But I found it stilted and boring. The concept was good: an investigation sixty-some years after her great-aunt died into whether or not she actually killed her husband, a charge for which she was acquitted. There were letters, interviews, even a diary/journal for clues. But the answer was so obvious and the writing so stilted, I found myself skipping through the pages just to confirm that that my first instincts as to who-dunnit were accurate. (They were.) There's no doubt the author, the wife of the British Ambassador to the United States, is a talented, intelligent woman. But the story was too drawn out, and the writing was pretentious, at least for me. 
 I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*&%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put "Low Rider" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that 
 I found this documentary left out some information about the Bush family that I thought would be included. The documentary did not cover George W. Bush's grandfather's working relationship with the Nazi party during the second world war. Nor did the doc spend much time on the rest of George's relatives and family members. The doc didn't include as much information as I thought that it would and the material that it covered has already been covered in other documentaries like Fahrenheit 9/11. The host of the documentary had to assert his fedora for no reason which was more distracting and annoying to see in what I expected to be a hard hitting, serious documentary 
 Ms. Vincent seems to sincerely dislike women.   In her various guises, Ms. Vincent attempts to relate to, to date and to seduce various women.  She tends to identify the resistance she meets from women as game playing, never seeming to consider the possibility that some women simply might not be interested in her.   She writes about being offended that a group of women talking animatedly amongst themselves seemed uninterested in getting to know her when she approached out of the blue at a bar.  It is almost as though she cannot imagine that women might not be available for conquest, that a group of women might not consider themselves to be "alone".  At one point, in response to a perceived slight by a woman she muses that she can understand the desire to rape.  Men should resist Ms. Vincent's `expose' about the experience of manhood.  
 this game is overrated  and there is to much aimless wandering . the same thing over and over  hope they dont make prey  
 This book was relevant at the time it came out, if nothing for the fact it helped pump the patriotism and zeal to go to war.  However now, after we know the true facts, the lies, and the totally corrupt and inept administration running this country - this book serves no purpose.  I recommend Bob Woodwards new book, "Bush at War Part 2:  Denial", where he illustrates in detail how bad this administration has bungled up everything.  Skip this one, it is no longer relevant.  The only thing Bush is at war with anymore is his own conscience and moral fabric - which is woefully lacking 
 Don't waste your time and money on this piece of excrement.  Ms. Homes HATES L.A. and lets the reader know it all the time.  She knows nothing of the history of Chateau Marmont.  She also has an ego so huge it wouldn't fit into Arrowhead Pond. No dear, it's not REALLY a pond!  The writer refers to herself more than once as an "intellectual from the East." Usually when someone speaks so highly of themselves it's frequently because no one else does.  Ms. Homes is like the one irritating girl in class that knows EVERYTHING and lets you know she knows everything all the time. If you want to read a truly splendid book about the Chateau Marmont pick up "Life at the Marmont" and don't waste any time and money on this one.  My copy will be on the garbage truck in the morning. If I could have chosen NO STARS I would. A.M. Homes you are a disgrace 
 If a person constantly predicts a bear market over a period of years, eventually he will prove right, since, as we all know, bull markets do not last forever, and bear markets are regular features of the stock market landscape. However, it is not enough simply to predict a bear market, one must predict a bear market at the right time. A prediction of a bear market during the early and mid 1990s (and there were many) would not be particularly helpful, since the bull continued to 2000. The same applies here to Mauldin. Mauldin predicted a bear market in 2004. He was wrong. A consistent bull market lasted from early 2003 until early 2006. The market has turned down since May of 2006, but as of this writing (Aug. 3), the market is still up significantly for the year. If you listened to John Mauldin's advice, you would have missed the bull market of 2004, 2005, and early 2006, especially in small-mid caps and foreign markets.   According to John Mauldin, bull and bear markets always last approximately 7-15 years. The facts do not support this conclusion. A bear market lasts for as long as it continues, and no longer. The bear market of 2000-2003 lasted only 3 years. Now according to Mauldin, the bull market of 2003-2006 is simply a "bear rally." But three plus years of positive returns cannot be so easily dismissed. In practical terms, for investors, you simply cannot afford to sit out a market rally like the 2003-2006 one.    Study after study has shown that the best way to minimize your risk and maximize your returns is to diversify, invest for the long run, and choose your mutual funds and stocks with great care after substantial research. One should not "buy and hold" blindly, but it's been proved that if your investment horizon is 9 years or more, a diversified portfolio of stocks will consistently outperform bonds. Furthermore, it's impossible to time the market successfully on any kind of consistent basis.   Mauldin is in the hedge fund business; hedge funds are designed to produce positive returns during bear markets. So it is in his personal interest to convince people that a bear market is coming. Hedge funds are limited to people with over a million dollars, so they are not exactly a viable solution for average investors. In addition, hedge funds are not the cure-all that Mauldin suggests. In fact, many hedge funds lose money and go out of business. They are, in fact, extremely risky investments, despite Mauldin's claims.   Mauldin believes in a deep value approach to stock picking, which I happen to agree with. Value stocks have lower volatility and tend to outperform the market in the long run. However, they don't do as well as growth stocks during bull markets, as several value fund managers learned during the late 1990s, some of whom even lost their jobs.   The argument Mauldin makes for a coming recession is pretty persuasive although not original. Trade deficits, budget deficits, an aging population, pension and medicare obligations; these all point to increased inflation (the least painful and only politically acceptable way to pay off our obligations) leading to recession and depressed stock prices. With the current market and economic conditions (Aug. 2006), it's time to think about some defensive investment choices: value and high-dividend stocks, and bonds. But we are not in a recession yet, and it's not inevitable. As Mauldin points out, quoting Greenspan, the market is so large and complex that it's essentially impossible to make accurate predictions. And the market is so efficient, that if it were possible to predict the future by any means, that information would be immediately and permanently discounted. 
 This is, by far, the worst book I have EVER been forced to read. One star is too much. The title of this book, "The culture of education" leads the reader to believe that the author knows something about education. He toots his own horn several times in the book saying how good he is at what he does, but wouldn't someone who knows something about education be able to relay information in a more effective way? This book is entirely unreadable. For example, here is a sentence from page 106. "Many of the tacit presuppositions guiding intersubjective transactions seem surprisingly incorrigible, even surprisingly inaccessible to conscious reflection." What exactly does this mean? I'll tell you what I think this book is. I think that Mr. Bruner is trying to impress people, while trying to make them feel stupid. If he has something to say, he should just say it! He buries whatever point he has in pretentious words such as "immutable," Pontogenetically," and "Hermeneutic." If you are buying this book on Amazon, I suggest you also purchase the biggest dictionary they sell 
 i was disapointed by this book and the presentation of it 
 I purchased Eldredge's "Wild at Heart", and I didn't think it was scripturally sound. I was given "Waking the Dead" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up.   John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like "The Matrix" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it.   The author also presents the image of God as "my friend". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway.   This is exactly the same theology as building the largest "Christian" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to "offend anyone". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't.   Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of "setting hearts free". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not "free" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, "Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ"...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service.   For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend "The Way of the Master" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron.  
 I am really amazed that so many people have liked this book.  To each her own, I suppose, but this is my first time reading Beatrice Small, and as a person who enjoys the work of Stephanie Laurens, JoAnn Ross, Nora Roberts and Diana Gabaldon, I can only recommend than anyone who likes the strong man with a strong woman taking on the world themes of all of the above mentioned ladies, you will likely hate this book as much as I do.  I remember my first time through Outlander, being taken aback when Jamie switches Claire, but that was nothing compared to the unrepentent sexual violence this book presents with it's "authentic" portrayal completely devoid of charm 
 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly.  They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD 
 This is an update of a prior review I wrote of this book, I changed my mind. I hadn't read the entire book but had been impressed with what I had read. The book does cover many aspects of commercial banking including regulations, capital and liquidity management, things of most interst to me as an analyst. However, a significant problem is that many of the examples used appear to be incorrect. For instance, the text often does not match the accompanying exhibits or tables. Perhaps the book was not edited well during an update to a new edition, and either the text or the exhibit/table was updated but not both (ie, in numerous cases they disagree). Whatever the reason, the numerous typographical errors made the book difficult to read, especially in a "self-study" situation. I'm looking elsewhere for a better guide 
 Possibly the worst design for an armband.  A fifth-grader could make a better armband with felt, velcro, scissors and some thread.  Not only can you not see the Nano screen, or adjust the volume while you are running (changing the volume is like trying to text message with gloves on), but you cannot adjust the tightness of the band with just one hand, it has too little elesticity and too small a velcro strip.  To top it off, the Nano is kinda difficult to get in and out of the band.  
 This book was extremely disappointing.  It is not written or illustrated by the creators of the Magic School Bus series and it is obvious from page one.  There are none of the informative side bars (papers, etc. "written" by the kids in the story) and the information is not as complete.  This alone makes the book less appealing than the originals, but to top it off, the children in the book bicker and compete with each other and are not supportive or respectful.  
 You can bet those people gaving Vista a good rating here, work for the company.  It's a piece of JUNK.  If you have a good working XP, or anything else, please don't buy Vista.  I bought it a month ago already installed on a good HP computer.  I've worked on it from sun-up to sun-down for a month and still, all I've got is a pile of junk.  And, it's so slow, that you have to take a coffee break while it's gathering up a program to run.  Don't buy their One-Care either.  I've owned Windows since "98".  I'm considering re-installing my old HP/XP.  It's still here in the closet 
 I had high hopes going into this book. I had learned of the "divine proportion" in a linear algebra class I'd taken and it inspired me to pick this book up.   In the beginning I wasn't surprised, Livio outlined so many amazing applications of phi that I couldn't wait to get into the more in depth explanations. However, once I had, it seemed to me that Livio was convincing me that It wasn't so "divine." In any other applications other than simple geometry phi fails at being anything miraculous. For instance, when attempted to apply it into aesthetics it's useless.   The only reason I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 is that it gives a great overview of the history of Phi, which I appreciated. Other than that, it at least convinced me that Phi is just another way of looking for a set universal design. However, after further thought you should realize that if it weren't there, another mathematical structure would be. Because if we're working with simple Euclidean geometry, we're bound to come up with the same answers when looking for proportions in geometrical shapes.  
 Do some people lose weight on this diet?  Sure.  Some people lost weight on the cabbage soup diet, others on the Adkins diet - but none of these are based on sound nutritional science.  Because of this, I would not recommend this book to anyone.  There are a lot of junk science diet books on the market.    If you are not only interested in losing weight, but are actually interested in becoming healthy, preventing or eliminating heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and so many other western diseases . . . then I would recommend Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, MD - an extremely well researched and documented book on how to lose weight by eating a nutritionally dense, healthy diet.  And it is surprisingly easy to do.  You will not only lose pounds, but a lot of Rx meds!  Another book that I highly recommend is the China Study, by T. Colin Campbell, MD - this book documents the larges nutritional study ever done.  A very readable book written by a top scientist - he shows you the science behind Dr. Fuhrman's work, and reinforces Dr. Fuhrman's claims about what it means to eat a truly healthy diet that will lead you to achieve and maintain your optimal weight. 
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 I read about one hundred pages and then, when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding, I quit. This was my first King book and I am not rushing out to buy another one, especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages.  Is it any wonder that it is selling on Amazon for a penny? Actually, I would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
 mono sound (how do you get you 3-prong RCA cables from the DVD player to work?)... after about 5 hours of use, the edges all around the screen are a green a purple hue for a few inches inward! Thanks God for Amazon.com customer service, we're sending it back and paying almnost twice as much for a tv 10x better.. 
 Please don't read this one for you first Kellerman, Alex Delaware book.  It falls far short of Kellerman's past Delaware stories.  Too many characters and the wrap up of the murders just doesn't cut it for me.  When Kellerman starts in on the African genocide, the book's rhythm takes a 180 and fizzles out from there to the end 
 That was supposed to be sounds of nature?? I assure all you people who don't get outside much that that's NOT the way it sounds! Some of the sample clips sound like someone shot a computer and recorded the noise it made with clips of bird songs recorded over it. (that and the water sounds like someone recorded the water going down a toilet) Awful, awful. I don't think the people who made these "natural sounds" have ever been outdoors, much less to a rainforest!! If you are looking for CONVINCING nature sounds I recommend you look some where else 
 On the front page The Times is quoted to have written: "Extremely funny!". I didn't have one laugh. Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression 
 If you are new to Dead Can Dance, please do yourself a favor and don't buy this album, which is by far the worst album they have ever recorded. It shows DCD's lack of new ideas and reworking of tired ones. You should start with _Within the Realm Of A Dying Sun_ or _The Serpents Egg_ instead.  
 I could not watch all it because one disc will not play.  What I could watch of the series, I would rate a 5 star 
 This toy looked cool in the package so I bought it for my 10 y/o son. He played with it for less than 10 minutes and it was trashed! The nose was caved in, the wings were broken, it was in like 5 pieces. If I hadn't been sitting there watching him play with it I would have swore that he tore it apart. All I can say is save the time and throw your $30 ( I got it on sale) directly into the trash! 
 Try before you buy! This game has a major glitch: its save game files are erased sometimes, so you can start all over again. Beware 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 Is as far as I could get. It wasn't even good falling asleep material. I soak up every half decent book on the mob. This ain't.  I understand the author is a journalist. Probly on the business page. It's that kind of droll style. It's weird cause the title and author are almost household names. Undeserved 
 I give this book one star as there was nothing lower to choose from.  Save your money.  This book is not worth either your time or your money.  Was she on drugs during the writing of this piece of tripe?  
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 The woman who helped engineer the useless war against the Christians in the Balkans (to help Klinton distract us fro Monicagate), promoted our sales of technology to the Korean Dictator so he could threaten the world with his nukes, is now in a panic to justify her actions which so harmed America. I cannot read the reviews which praise her without wondering how she could be so misunderstood/identified.  She is a disgrace 
 This item will indeed brew coffee, but not without some shortcomings. First, the mechanism that allows you to remove and pour a cup while it is brewing doesn't work very well. You have to use one hand to hold the unit in place while you forcibly shove the coffee pot into place; usually resulting in some spilt coffee all over the inside of the unit. Second, for some reason, the spout that empties hot water over the grounds inside is mounted on a swivel that you have to move in and out of the way every time you use it. Only a mild nusience, really , but nevertheless, annoying. I suppose the moron who designed it would have you believe it brews a better cup that way, but that is obviously nonsense. Also, The opening to pour the water into is very small--your aim better be good. If this is on an average counter top, you're going to have to lift the water up quite high and hope you can hit the opening without spilling. Lastly, the steam that comes off while it is brewing condenses on the front faceplate, where the switches and circuitry is and I can't help but believe over time, the moisture will penetrate inside and probably short out the wiring-probably just after the warrantly runs out. To sum up: Overpriced! Poor value! Idiotic design. [... 
 Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now."  And what did I find as a result of my maverick literary exploration?  Ehh...  Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful.  If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere 
 This book is a joke.  For a beginner looking for a comprehensive guide for investing, don't buy this book, unless you want a lesson in being ripped off.  This book is the size of a coaster, the kind you find next to the checkout at the pharmacy about how to get various stains out of your argyle socks.  It's made up to look cute; a two inch hardcover tomb, complete with dustjacket.  Misspellings and grammatical errors abound in this nugget.  Aspects of investing are listed, but not explained to any extent that might help someone actually pick stocks.  "A Fool And His Money Are Soon Parted," by Peter Lynch.  Buy another one of his books (a "big kid" book), but not this one 
 I am a big fan of Emily Dickinson, I love her poetry, but this edition is thoroughly rotten.  It is not Emily Dickinson's poetry, but the edited version of her poetry, significantly changed by the same editor who rejected Dickinson's poems while she was alive.  This edition is changed so much from the original poems that most of Dickinson's meaning is lost.  If you want to read what Emily Dickinson really wrote, I reccomed the complete poetry of Emily Dickinson edited by Thomas H. Johnson, it is the complete and original poetry of Dickinson 
 Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 I could not finish this book.  The writing was stilted and generally not readable to me.  The plot seemed interesting, but the writing style coupled with the unbelievability of the characters at the beginning of the book left me simply not caring about the story, or characters.  You have to have one of three things to make a book readable:  Good writing style, good characters or good plot.  This book almost had a good plot, but it was buried with poor writing and wooden characters.  I do not recommend this book 
 This book should have been a collection of short stories.  It needs some heavy editing.  There are moments of real science fiction and story telling, but it is burdened by preaching.  
 You're led to believe that these are the full-length hits when you play them, but DONT BE FOOLED!!  They are chopped up shortened versions of the original hits!!  FAME by David Bowie has about 2 min taken out, and the great guitar riff at the end of the Lynard Skynard "Freebird" tune is chopped off at the end . .A RIP OFF!! 
 We couldn't find ANY of the collectibles on which we needed information - and the index was the WORST I've ever seen!  I felt totally ripped off with this book but it would cost more to return than it was worth.  Maybe I can find an antique outhouse and supply it with a fresh 2007 price guide... 
 My kitchen is all Kitchenaid so of course I had to have this, but as other commenters said - they can do better.  It's a pain to set, it's angle is awkward and you have to be right in front of it to see the display and at the right angle (I'm short).  And the beep isn't that loud.  There's no clock in it either.  The metal band around the outer rim corroded too so it doesn't look nice anymore.  I have a non-Kitchenaid timer that's got the clock, 2 timers, a button to set H/M/S seperately, and shows you how long it's been since you missed the beep that beeps for over a minute.  I use this one more.  (I think it's an older West Bend model 
 Look, straight up. Don't get this Book! It is a joke of a book. This thing is awful. Bad art and all! This thing is terrible! I give this book a ZERO! And I mean that! It will do you absolutely no good! Please save your money 
 Simple ideas.  Was not very useful for my work environment. I was looking for something that was a little different or unusual that we haven't tried 
 Pick any house on any street.  Pick any random two people(Man and Woman), give them a script and let them go wild. I promise you could make this movie work better than the producers. Nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring. The acting and settings in this movie are just horrible. By the end you WANT everyone to die just to become interested. Now, I don't usually give bad ratings and I really like "B" horror films, but the lack of effort here is unbelievable. Just nothing to interest me 
 I'm just not feelin the love on this one.  The first story is ok, but kinda dull and the second is just too wordy and all this crap about incubus and imps etc.  Are all Katie Macalister books this way?  If so, I won't be a fan.  I like some vampire stuff, but if it gets too out there or detailed, I can't take it.  The third is also ok, but same thing on almost ever chapter.  Not a keeper and I wouldn't pay for it.  Good thing I got it used 
 I bought the ultra hydrating shampoo, conditioner, and the treatment, oh and also the hairspray.  These products dried my hair out horribly and weighed it down.  I gave it 2 weeks because it was so expensive and after two weeks my hair never has looked any worse!  I have naturally wavy, thick coarse hair and this made my hair unmanageable - like a helmet head.  My hair had no movement, no shine--just made it very heavy and weighed down.  Last night I used a hair purifier shampoo that gets gunk, minerals, etc out of your hair and after that I deep conditioned it with Kerestase Masintense - wow, what a difference!!  Afer blowdrying my hair it was soft, shiny and had so much bounce!  I woke up this morning and my hair was still awesome.  So glad to have my old hair back - I was beginning to think I had a hormone problem or water problem but it was this Ojon product - horrible if you have the type of hair I have.  Good Luck 
 One star is too generous!  AAARRRGGGH!  I am still mad about this book and I read it 3 books ago!  I loved Ted Dekker's "Three" and I enjoyed Peretti's children's books I read with my kiddos, so I was looking forward to the arrival of a collaboration.  But it was utterly silly!  If I start a book, I have to finish it.  Okay, that's my own fault, but I had to MAKE myself read this to get it over with!  I wanted to burn the book when I was finished to make sure nobody else I knew ever read my copy.   The ending?  Well, "Shoo!  Get out of here!"  was embarrassing!  Shame on you, Frank and Ted 
 Based on an extensive research project this book promises a lot but delivers nothing. The first thing that you have to recognize is that there is hardly any structure at all. Repitions abound without adding any value. The style of writing is close to unbearable - they could have put the contents into a fourth of the pages. The cases are sketchy at best; they claim to offer best practices but are nothing new. The book tries to look into the future and puts forward a wildly speculative view of what the authors think lies ahead; again they do not offer a vision but describe the status quo in future tense. For people who like real satire I recommend Moody's Harley Davidson poem! Summary: Only recommended for those who need to own every book on the subject.. 
 Well, I must say that the DVD has many aspects:  1. Most of the music is absolutely annoying and horrible for a topic such as gnosticism. Furthermore, the volume of the music itself sometimes does not allow us to listen clearly to the words of the narrator.  2. Everything in reduced to this: GNOSIS is an alectromagnetic experience with the quantum universe that lies within the self. Hence, to be illuminated by Christ or to be a Buddha is just to achieve an electromagnetic condition offered by the union with the Universal Mind and the kundalini in us.  3. The narratror fails to expose a very important and key idea: there are TWO types of kundalini and two main centers in the human body. He never speaks of the Kundalini of the Heart. He speaks only of the lower kindalini, the one responsible for the human sexuality.  4. Anyway, it is worth to watch the DVD once. But be prepare to endure a very disgusting and annoying music that hides the most important thing: the words of the narrator! Too much especualtion, at the end.  It is sad that there is not yet in the market a good DVD on GNOSIS or Gnosticism, made with ellegance, fair scientifical research and seriousness, without any music at all as the background.  This DVD is an excellent example of how annoying can music be! 
 teenage vegans and vegetarians aren't stupid people. if i had read this befor i had gone vegan, i probably wouldn't have... there are so many other great books out there with better information. try anne marie colbin's "food and healing.&quot 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 My recommendation is not to waiste time on this book, especially if you are considering meeting a Russian woman.  The only advice  given, was not to seek a Russian wife, and instead for Christians to pray for a wife.  The authors also recommended that if you are not Christian, to convert, and then pray.  Lastly, coauthor Julia Rossedahl clearly had an angry attitude towards any man that would seek a wife from the FSU 
 Just as the other mothers have stated, nothing about this pump is beneficial.  It was given to me by a lactation nurse, but it was more trouble than it was worth.  Only once was I able to pump more than one ounce (it took almost an hour), and I hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing.  I only needed it occassionally, but this was such a waste of time I bought the pump in style, which is amazing.  This is not comparable to the more expensive Medela pumps, so if you want something that works with little discomfort, invenst in the pump in style or similar model.  Don't waste your money, even if it is cheap 
 Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film 
 Probably my own fault. I was looking for something more like the Spirited Away soundtrack. This album is VERY experimental 
 Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band. I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it 
 A very outdated book. Not very good even when it was relevant. There's just no substance and the ideas that are touched on are not followed through.  Just enough material to be really dangerous for a novice. Please don't even read the chapter on trading thinly-traded, non-liquid issues. Don't even go there and get that idea out of your head permanently. "The art of going broke."  I really, really doubt that this guy is still trading, or if he is, that his lifetime trades show a net profit. I'd make a substantial bet against that.  If you are a newbie, get Toni Turner's daytrading book instead.  [... 
                     DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!! I bought this on pay-per-view not to long ago,... It started out GREAT!- The story is good,-The syle is nice,-The art style is good,- The art itself is GREAT- The movie-....IT'S -DOWN-RIGHT BORRRINNNGGGG----!!!!!!! The movie almost put me to sleep!-is simply mind numbing!-_-zzzZZZ I thoght the story was eehhh...ok. I give the story 3 stars, but the movie....Negative-onecentillion stars! (centillion=303-700 zerros) WHHHAATT KIND OF MOVIE IS THIS??!!!! -I couldn't even pause it! ;_; 
 Pros: Low price, looks good in the package, adequately slices and dices small pieces of meat and thin veggies.  Cons: Flexible thin blade, extremely lightweight, and air pockets are too small to be effective -- veggies stick to the blade.  Conclusion: If you regularly need to use a Santoku knife, spend a little more and buy something with more weight/heft and deeper dimples.  This is more like a disposable knife that you might take on a vacation or use in a pinch.   
 I was disappointed with how the illustrations were presented.  The explanations were done clearly, but not a book for those who are looking for ideas for new ink 
 I placed my first order for the red casserole in March.  It was not slated to be delivered until May!  But, I waited patiently for it.  In May I see that it has finally been shipped and delivered to my house, but I never received it.  So they send a replacement.  And it is white, not red.  And apparently they no longer have red 
 On one hand, this book makes useful points and divorce and its impact on children and offers better alternatives. The problem with it is that most of the evidence is anecdotal. I don't think a lot of the problems the people in the book had were due to divorce, but to the way their parents handled the divorce. Many of them either leaned on their children too much for support or they went from giving their children attention and affection to ignoring them in favour of work and other mates. A lot of the problems could have been lessened with more care. Especially in the case of the fellow who had a congenital heart defect. He needed attention and help, he didn't need to be shunted off to the side. I'm also reading about attachment issues and how they can impact a person from the time they are a baby to an adult. If a person has to divorce, they should ask themselves if it is the right thing to do and if all other options have been exausted. Forcing people to stay together in a stagnating marriage seems a bit cruel to me, like in the case of the intact family she used as an example.  Also, I do not agree with her stating that children don't notice the tention and fighting in their family. They do. Children notice more than people give them credit for. Like so many experts she paints with too broad a brush. She uses too many generalizations. It lessens the impact of her argument. But, a lot of the advice she gives to the system could be used to make divorce easier on parents and children. Divorce isn't going away anytime soon, but, with responsibility and care perhaps it can be easier on children. It is hard for children to adapt to changes. I suggest looking at the advice she offers, but question her methods and conclusions 
 If you like whiteboy rap with terrible flow, this cd is for you. I loved "steal my sunshine" but the rest completely sucks. They arent even good rappers and thats the genre most prevailent here. Just buy the single 
 According to the author, Australian history is 200 years of racism, sexism, oppression, dominance, exploitation. The victims are aborginal people, women, the early convicts -- and the environment.  The villains, of course, are white males. When the Australian economy dips, the fault lies with the U.S., world capitalism and neoliberalism. When the Australian economy thrives, it just means Aussies can waste more money on bourgeois geegaws. The tone is humorless, unrelenting, shrill, one-sided -- a prime example of what one Australian referred to as "black armband history". 
 Viewers hoping to see the controversial "pistol" scene, in which McGillis's character is forced by her jealous husband to open her legs for his gun will be disappointed to find that it has been cut from the R-rated DVD version.  For that, you'll apparently have to stick with the unrated VHS tape.  Other than that, the movie is a decent if unspectacular B thriller, and the digital transfer is pretty good 
 This could have been a very exciting book if it had been written by someone such as James Dodson instead of by Mr. Palmer.  Although he shares with us information about many exciting moments of golf matches and  facinating individuals, the book becomes incredibly boring because of all  his first person I-Me-My references 
 Sorry, I really wanted to like this book, since I've had a horrible experience writing code to handle audio on a PC (.wav files, audio sampling are much messier and less intuitive than need be). I AM an expert at DSP, having done it for over 25 years, with many hardware/firmware designs under my belt. I would not have slammed this book for one simple reason. The code examples are buggy and crash. Yikes, the fellow rails on Microsoft and the low quality of their compilers. His code does not work.  Sorry, I tried, I really did, but this book mostly text describing C++ classes which are on the CD. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands - just get a decent DSP book (Antoniou, oppenheim). Try Embree or Rorabaugh if you want books with DSP code in them. 
 I started writing code for the web back when you could still order it as a text only service.  DOS ruled the day, and there were no ads plastered on every site.  This is the first product that takes HUGE STEPS BACKWARD in useability, functionality, and performance since the public birth of the web.  Unlike the previous reviewers glowing account of AS 4000 I am looking at new software because the service that this company provides and their complete lack of a proactive nature with regard to its useability have rankled me one too many times.  To wit:  1.  I am running a dual core 3.0 with 1 gb of memory and the 3d draw is slower that previous versions. 2.  Tech support had the audacity to tell me that going to a drop down menu to rotate an item selected is faster than a right click of the mouse and a context menu that would allow me to do the same from that menu.  This is a step backward of at least 10 years.  Previous versions had the right click menu which also had delete and other frequently used commands available.  Really piss poor on their part to eliminate this feature alone. 3.  Despite a fast newer machine, once you select an item you have to wait before you can move it by selecting it a second time.  Pitiful. 4.  Won't import standard dxf files without saving them as one layer.  Making a product that won't play nice with others is a bad thing.  I have other issues, but just don't want to spend any more time on this company or their products.  If I ran my business and failed to listen to my customers like punch, I would be out of business.  Bottom line:  NO LONGER RECOMMENDE 
 Without a doubt, the Pepper Pad has potential but it isn't really ready for prime time.  It is nicely made and priced well below many of the other ultra portable laptops and UMPCs.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer still has a significant # of issues to work out before the Pepper Pad 3 rises to the user friendly level it must be at to garner the mass market. [...]There are a # of software glitches that are also causing user irritation that may or may not be addressed in upcoming software updates.  If you are not familiar with Linux and enjoy the user friendliness of Windows, there is a relatively steep learning curve.  Linux devotees, however, love this product.  They enjoy tearing into the software and souping up their pads.  You can not print or use "office-type" applications with this.  In conclusion, if you are fluent in Linux, don't need to print or use office type applications and are fortunate enough to get a pad devoid of the touch screen problems and with the needed software updates, the Pepper Pad 3 may be for you 
 if it is one thing i hate in a book it's a gimmick. gimmick writing is almost never clever or interesting or good, it is simply a gimmick. the gimmick here is that mr amis writes the novel backwards. the story, all dialogue, everything is backward. end to beginning, this, like all gimmicks, gets real tiresome, real fast. years ago i read mr amis's book "money," which i loved. i have been looking forward to reading more of him, so this came as a great disappointment. don't waste your time

 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Lie to me and Wander this world are so much different and much much better, if you are a blues fan. I bought it for "Give me up again", which is in a very good version on the Clapton DVD "Crossroads Festival". The rest is more like a Prince style, Pitty, hardly any guitar, Jonny is slipping away from the blues 
 I bought this as a gift for a 10 year old this christmas and her first impression was " why on Earth would you buy this book for ME?" I felt really bad when i read it myself. The author uses old paintings anyone who is into Mermaids has already seen a million times, nothing new here.. and nothing recent in terms of art! Also this book is not very large or really very informitive. It essentially brushes across the subject of Mermaids as if this was your first introduction to the subject. I didnt' learn a thing there was tons of old quotes on Mermaids all of them meaning nothing. The worst part other then the lack of real research and imagination, was that all the paintings don't have captions so if you want to know where the paintings came from, who made them and what story they are from you have to find it somewhere in the back of the book, truely annoying and unnessary. This book or any book on Mermaids could have been "oh so much more". I have no idea why it got so many high stars from people! There is I see now, Tons of wonderful books on Amazon much better then this one on mermaids dont' let your search stop here 
 Somewhat interesting, and at times amusing.  Although at times there is potential for depth in critically evaluating living at the bottom of the world, the author rarely goes there.  He is stuck on the absolute surface of things, rattling along, I suspect, on pot or some other substance.  He seems to have no perspective from which he can organize his observations into any kind of meaningful structure 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 WOULD SOMEONE WHO HAS READ THIS BOOK PLEASE WRITE A REVIEW MORE THAN 7 WORDS LONG SO THOSE OF US WHO HAVEN'T READ IT WILL HAVE AN IDEA WHAT IT IS ABOUT 
 Granted, the divorce rate is at 50% in our country, but what is it in other countries? It's easier here to give up, or to make a hasty decision to get married.  The institution of marriage isn't what's wrong, it's the people who use bad judgement and who don't believe in having to work for something worthwhile.  Nothing worthwhile comes easy, and I for one, believe that Kipnis advocates the easy way out - she is a proponent of succumbing to lust and desire over deeper more meaningful states of loyalty and commitment which sustain the longevity of a relationship.  She fails to address what happens when children come into the equation, and what happens to the family as an institution when monogamy is thrown aside.  What then? What kind of society would this be if parents were free to pursue a better sex life and abandon the responsibility of providing an emotionally stable household structure? Though she poses interesting questions that elicit strong reactions in both directions, she fails to propose a viable solution, and her polemic only results in coming off as more of a rant than a productive piece of literature.  
 C. S. Lewis exposed the circular reasoning in Hume in the book "Miracles."  David Hume was not a skeptic.  He was a freemason and therefore a gnostic.  He was only skeptical of nongnostic positions, such as Christianity.  He was an apologist for gnosticism.  He had blind faith allegiance to the masonic lodge and its creed.  His argument against miracles is his chief argument against Christianity, and it suffers from circular reasoning.  Circular reasoning you exclaim?  Yes.  Hume argued that miracles violate uniform experience.  However, if uniform experience is against mircales, then they cannot happen.  Uniform experience is his presupposition.  But, uniform experience is defined to exclude miracles.  If they didn't happen, well, they didn't happen.  This begs the question.  I have a better argument than Lewis's.  I would simply point out that pure logic cannot dispense with the empirical question of whether miracles happen.  Afterall, mathematics is made up of tautologies.  As such, mathematics or logic or any formal reasoning cannot have physical meaning.  Pure logic, as Hume employs, cannot tell us anything about the world.  Therein lies the sophistry.  It boils down to the distinction between analytic statements and synthetic statements.  Whether or not miracles happen depends not on logic, but on the existence of God who intervenes in human affairs.  As the former atheist Antony Flew said, it is impossible to argue against the existence of God in light of the evidence of intelligent design of the universe.  If anyone went to the moon and found a house there that supplied oxygen, food and other human necessities, they wouldn't hesitate to posit a creator of that house.  So why would anyone question the existence of God in light of this wonderful planet that supports our lives?  What is remarkable about him is how irrational he is.  He possesses a flair for writing and shows great promise in reasoning.  Yet, he sacrifices good reasoning for pushing his gnostic agenda.  It's like a person who graduates from medical school who decides to murder patients, or a graduate from law school who chooses to rob banks.  He tries to use reasoning to support irrational thought.  Hume was a strange man.  The engine is running, but there's no one behind the wheel.  
 While occasionally interesting and compelling, the nonsensical anti-evolution message not only makes the book's focus leave suspence and head, instead, for religious banter, it also makes things confusing and impractical.  While Crichton's "State of Fear" gave a brilliant argument againt global warming through fiction, this novel does nothing brilliantly and, in fact, some things quite miserably 
 unless you are a complete newbie at ninja gaiden, this guide is worthless.  full of empty space and pictures with very little information.  the worst offense? "ALL ITEM LOCATIONS" in huge print on the cover.  But, as i discovered, this guide doesn't show item locations for level other than normal!! The guide has pretty much no discussion of strategy for weapons, even omitting strats for some weapons ( like kitetsu ) because they are "secret".  terribly uninformed and underresearched, this guide is a greivious offense to an amazing game 
 I'll be up front and say I never finished this book. I have about 70 reviews here and this is the only one on a book I never finished. It wasn't that it was terrible or lacking in information, it's just that it was so, so boring and superficial. All the encounters with Hitler had all the emotion of checking out a book from the library. The behind the scenes may have come later, but by a third of the way through I wasn't going to wait around to find out. Plus it was hard to overcome the feeling that there was no way this wasn't going to be a self-serving attempt by the author to restore his public image.  Again, I didn't finish, so take my review for what it's worth, but it's rare that I read that far on a book and then find it so dull I lose all interest 
 I thoroughly enjoyed previous entries in the "Cat Who..." series, but this one was very disappointing.  In fact, I was so disappointed in this one that I pulled out a couple of older ones to see if my tastes had simply changed!  No, the book just doesn't measure up.  As another viewer commented - too cutesy, too predictable, too little mystery.  I will look for subsequent titles at the library rather than purchase them in hardback.  I hope this is just an oddball flop 
 I own eight books by Sears and this is the only one I would not highly recommend.  There isn't much in here that isn't in The Baby Book, though it goes into slightly greater detail in some areas.  It is lacking in good techniques that work for babies age 9 months to 18 months unless they are very "easy" children.  If you have an easy or average baby it is a quick read and might be worth the time if you know little or nothing about normal infant sleep.  If you have a child with a challenging temperment don't even bother 
 o.k., i just finished listening to the C.D. of Predator, which i had downloaded on my I-pod.   Well, i kept thinking the book was abridged, or maybe i had made a mistake in the download.  It jumped around so much that i was convinced it was abridged, but it wasn't!  i have so many questions, i can't even list them all, and think maybe we should all form an on-line group to see if any of us can answer them.  1. was Johnny the doctor killed or was it suicide?  and who killed him, and most importanly, WHY?    2. why were the members of the family killed and how were they known by the serial killer? 3. when did Kay and Benton make up, and why the heck is she always so angry? this is just the beginning 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 I have almost all the recordings of Neil Diamond since the early 70's and to listen to this is does a poor service to the artist's career as a performer. The audio remastering is poor, the musical arrangements are even worse. Even though this is supposed to be live, make no mistake this is no "Live at the Greek" or "Hot August Night" this sounds more like elevator music. If you are an enthusiast of Neil Diamond's music and passionate performance don't dissapoint yourself with this recording 
 John Horgan is one of those intellectually challenged journalists who only want to write about big things because they are too proud to be interested in any particular "small" question that science tries to solve. So many of these journalists choose a truly big theory - namely that there is something seriously wrong with the scientific method and with science and that science may be ending.  Of course, the scientists consider all such journalists and "thinkers" to be cranks, for a very good reason. The very existence of our civilization - something that distinguishes most of us from the monkeys - is based on certain general principles that also underlie science and these principles will never be given up unless the whole humankind is really doomed.  Careful thinking that is as quantitative as possible and the elimination of ideas that have turned out not to be viable are two examples of such principles.  John Horgan, is his attempt to earn his 15 minutes of fame - plus some bucks - has written this nasty book that not only offered a whole sequence of possible theories how science can finally be killed and how horrible science is. This book was also full of personal attacks against the scientists, their appearance, their voice, and all of their other superficial and unimportant characteristics.   John Horgan was - and still is - just far too dumb to be able to look into the scientists' thoughts, the entities that make the scientists important. At least, he could analyze their "quirkiness" and write confusing stories about the scientists and aliens that have nothing to do with the essence of the research done by the actual scientists.  Such crappy books have always found a lot of readers who eagerly buy them. However, the books have no lasting value. It's been almost 10 years since the book was released, and all of its predictions look even more absurd now than they looked 10 years ago. The science hasn't ended, Edward Witten is still the most respected physicist, and John Horgan is still just a despicable nobody.  Also, this book is the 360,000th most successful book at amazon.com; compare with The Elegant Universe that has been among the top 1,000 books more or less for the whole time. Nevertheless, the big doomsayers and science-haters will never close their mouth. So they still flood the book market with many new crappy books that are very similar to Horgan's book - Troubles with Physics, Not Even Wrong, and various feminist diatribes against the male science - books that will surely share the fate of this nonsense written by Horgan. But before the time will speak, thousands of new stupid consumers will buy these books and they will say how terribly inspiring the content is 
 The other readers pegged it nicely: this book is self-loathing and superior. I read this when I was fourteen and, fourteen years later, found myself rereading it when I cleaned out my closet. I can't believe the arrogance and myopia of its WASP narrator. This book is internalized homophobia coupled with upper middle class snobbery at its worst. No doubt if the author was born in Nazi Germany sixty years ago, he would be Hitler's right hand man in his pink triangle quest to oppress homosexuals, or at least, those too limp wristed and "icky" for Andrew Tobias' liking. I'm aghast other readers are recommending his book for those coming out of the closet. 
 The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha 
 If you are the type that likes happy endings, avoid this movie!  Bruce Willis dies and he doesn't save the world, and the journey to this depressing conclusion is no fun at all.  It reminded me of Arlington Road, where the terrorist uses the good guy to blow up the building at the end of the movie.  Also, in this movie, the repetitive flashbacks to Bruce's airport dream were overdone.  By the 3rd time, I was saying "I got it already", and by the 5th or 6th flashback I was ready to throw something at the screen.  In the featurette, Terry Gilliam said that he thought he had managed to snooker the major studios into producing a "European art movie".  He did, and I hate European art movies.  On the other hand, if you like such things, you'll probably like the film.  It was well acted 
 This is a vicious book written by someone who obviously hated Diana, Princess of Wales.  And if anyone is 'mentally ill' it is Lady Campbell.  I understand 'lady' Campbell had a very strange childhood.  Apparently, her parents could not decide whether she was a boy or girl!  And I think it created a 'crack' in her brain.  Diana paid dearly for standing up for herself and getting out of her pathetic marriage.  Her husband was a Prince who turned out to be a selfish toad.  She was definitely a lamb to the slaughter.  And as for saying that Diana was schizophrenic that is postively ludicrous!    
 After reading this book, I would have to say Michael Apple did a wonderful job using examples to describe how modern public schools in the United States are flawed. He also did a good job introducing ideas, which might have been alien to many people, regarding elements of public education in America. However, it seems he spends too much time on the tautology of blaming Republicans for the misfortunes and pratfalls of present pedagogy. One must remember that Democrats and Republicans are both cut from the same cloth. In addition, if Apple wants to scream bloody murder about how many blemishes that Republicans have caused public education, he needs to remember that Democrats really have not made it any better. The "No Child Left Behind" act is something that both the left and the right support, and after working in public education for over a year, I can tell you this act really does not work.  Apple does explain notions of Channel One and product placement in public schools, which then dictates curriculum. He also goes into detail about how the media influences education and contemporary society. Nevertheless, he spends more time pointing fingers and telling you what is wrong. However, he never expresses any lucid or tangible means to ameliorate this quagmire facing our youth and public education.   There is a fine line between making a wonderful argument and whining like a baby. Apple does a great job performing the latter. Mind you, Republicans are not perfect politicians by any stretch of the imagination. Just look at some of the things that have happened over the past few years. Yet, Apple's diatribe seems more like whimpering, instead of fighting back, or addressing a solution to all the things, he is complaining about. Overall, this is an interesting read, but Apple is nowhere near the philosophical icon of John Dewey.   
 A previous reviewer expounded ad nauseum on the anger and rage that MUST be felt by fat women the world over; almost as though he himself has been involved with women of size and felt their wrath. However, that is more indicative of his own issues (why keep choosing women with these issues? He himself must be overly familiar with anger and rage) than an indicator of the value of the book. I found the book to contain many of the familiar diatribes and platitudes of any recovery program, without the depth. This is not to say that there were NO redeeming qualities; simply that such a simplistic ideology about the reasons for obesity insult the individual who suffers from such a disease 
 I really like the instructor Michelle Dozois. She teaches in the 10-minute solution series. That's mainly why I bought this dvd. I was dissapointed with it. The only routine I like is Dance Party. Other than that I think the routines are so-so. Maybe it's just me. I am more athletic and don't really like dance style to get fit. For fun, I think it's great. I don't really recommend this if you are trying to get a good cardio workout. 
 I read this book because: of my love for old school jazz and the big "HOOPLA" over this publication! I can't say that I gained much knowledge from this book. If you are a true collector of jazz and know Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Lee Morgan, Charlie Parker, Dizzy, Wes Montgomery, Freddie Hubbard, Billie Holiday, Coltrane and others then you already know more or as much as what is written here.You've got 512 pages to tell a story about a subject so diverse and complex that I don't know how he did it and felt that justice was done! What I would have preferred he did was to write several books on jazz EACH concentrating on a particular era. That way I think the public would get a true and comprehensive study of our most beautiful and natural resource--jazz. Sorry but I can't offer a rating higher than 2 - 2 1/2 stars 
 I bought this album because I love Charlie Haden's tone, and was impressed by the inclusion of the very fast playing alto saxist Miguel Zenon and pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba in the credits. But why were they hired? There's hardly any need in the bland arrangements for more than competent amateurs. It certainly needs a singer and a rocket up the band. I am so puzzled by the five star reviews that I went back and switched on the CD. The track I picked at random was nice, but I couldn't face a second, and played a Fall record instead to wake me up. I shall try again, but it seems a bit dreary.  
 This book is way too technical for the average photographer looking to get started using infrared film. Too many charts that only confuse and don't translate to in the field shooting. The images are also poorly composed and  not creative. A waste of money 
 DENNIS LEARY IS HAILED AS SOME GREAT ANGRY YOUNG MAN WHO IS TRYING TO BRING THE WORLD TO RIGHTS. PERSONALLY I PREFER BILL HICKS. AT LEAST WHEN BILL DID IT HE WAS BEING ORIGINAL!!!!!!! DENNIS LEARY HAS IN MY OPINION NICKED BILL HICKS ACT IN A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW I FEEL ABOUT JOSS STONE COMPARED TO PROPER SOUL ARTISTS. SITTING IN FRONT OF A FEW LIVE VIDEOS OF A GREAT MAN AND TAKING NOTES DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL EVER BE ONE DENNIS! DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS COVERS BANDS...STICK TO THE ACTING DENNIS 
 If you are looking for a very easy and quick to read book this is the one for you.  What to Expect When You're Expecting is written by a mother (Arlene Eisenberg) and her two daughters Heidi and Sandee.  These ladies have written several books in the series, they call "What to Expect When..."   There are a few positive aspects of this book; the author's give information on the month to month physical changes that occur during pregnancy, including physical discomforts and how the fetus changes throughout the nine months.  There is some basic information on medical conditions that may arise during pregnancy and basic breastfeeding information for the immediate postpartum period.    This is a good book to read for an overview of pregnancy, labor, birth and the early postpartum period.  I would recommend that you also read other more in-depth books such as: The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth written by Henci Goer, The Pregnancy Book, by Dr William Sears and his wife Martha Sears, RN, and Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, RN, Midwife.   
 B"H  I've liked all of the Dianne Mott Davidson books, but this was the weakest, by far.  What a snotty kid Arch has turned into -- made worse by the fact that the new character, Liz, also has a spoiled brat. The both need a dose of Dr. Laura.   It's one thing to create unsavory characters to heighten tension, it's quite another to fill the book with them. In this one, there's no one to like -- It actually occured to me to wonder who really wrote this thing.    Maybe it's time to leave Goldy and Liz to their futures of bailing out their kids -- literally -- and focus on Julian, instead. He's the only one to have his act together.  So-so plot, annoying characters, not especially interesting recipes.  I won't be looking forward to the next one quite as much... 
 not very easy to fill into the original filter; but it saves money though 
 I actually rate this book as absolutely ZERO stars.  There is ACCURATE information available 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 I found this book sophomoric and silly.  Not up to par.  
 I guess this wasnt the type of book for me... it was boring, not surprising, and it felt like 3 months had gone by since i started the book (took me 2 weeks to read)! If i hadn't had to read this for school I would've never finished it 
 I am sure there are others who have already stated what I am about to write, however I felt it my duty as an educated reader to warn the populace about this book. I enjoy kinky writing just like the next closet freak, however this book was absolute drivel. It made little sense from beginning to end. The writing was beyond elementary. The "show but don't tell" rule of writing is thrown out the window. Everything the reader is supposed to learn is stated by one character or another in very dry and silly dialogue. I don't know how people got turned on while reading this. Its rediculous and not well thought out. Personally I am convinced that Anne Rice's Master made her write and publish this novel as a "punishment", because something so juvenile could not have been a true attempt at well written fiction. 
 I have mixed feelings about this product.  The idea behind it is fine--keep all of your CDs/DVDs in one place, away from too much handling.  The problem is that the Sony implementation is mediocre at best.  The user interface is *terrible*; so bad you almost can't believe that they'd release a product like this.  You need a keyboard to do anything reasonable, and the "Load info from DVD" feature barely works.  And when it does, it's wrong and uneditable.  The remote control is so poorly laid out that it's almost comical.  The most important button, to get a list of your DVDs, is labeled "Folders" and is tiny and in a bad location.  Plus once all your DVDs are loaded, then what?  You only can support one TV...I have other TVs and a DVD player in the car, so I either have to unload them (and the device forgets everything), or have to copy all the DVDs that I need to use on multiple machines.  If you are not sure whether to get this, I'd consider buying your movies from iTunes and using an AppleTV, or some other similar model.  You might also consider any fair use provisions that let you keep a copy of the DVDs you rightfully own for permanent insertion into this device (although the interface is still absolutely horrible).    If the remote and user interface were actually functional and elegant, I'd probably feel differently about this product 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 The character development in this book is absurd.  Ann is mentioned all over the place in the context of the dialog of others, but has such little development that in the end, she barely matters.  The priests are stereotypes, and terrible ones at that.  Many parts of this story could have been cut and were absolutely boring.  I am so disappointed in this book and the overall story.  I'm angry at how negatively G. characterizes people, society, (not that I want a happy go-lucky book,  but G. is just obnoxious, self-serving, and elitist) and the faithful.  The quirks of Carolyn are idiotic and not humorous.  The only one you end up feeling something for is Tom Cross (albeit mildly in that Hallmark Channel ending way).  This book could have been so much more.  G. has proven himself as a smart and talented writer.  Too bad this book got in the way 
 I read Bergdorf Blondes earlier this summer and highly recommend it if you'd like to suspend reality for a few hours and get a girly, humorous dose of the high-maintenance lifestyle of a Manhattan socialite.  I certainly can't say the same for Debutante Divorcee - the story is far less engaging; the observations of manners, dress, and other details of society life are shallow and don't add much to the storytelling.  Worse, the characters evolve from boring to saccharine - and their respective stories are tied up at the end in a very unimaginative, deux ex machina sort of way that will leave you rolling your eyes.  Methinks PS could do better.  
 The unit works fine for charging my sandisk mp3 player, but I can not get a clear broadcast through any of the available FM frequencies 
 I don't know what I was expecting from Hubert Sumlin. Surely not a rehash of some old Muddy Waters' and Willie Dixon chestnuts that were done correctly the first time with Muddy's voice and band. This album was a big dud. Sumlin takes the songs and tries to sing them and tries to make his band sound as if they were recording in the same style and sound as Chess Studio in the 1940's and 50's. Unfortunatley Muddy had a better voice and so does Willie Dixon for that matter. All the session men sound like add-ons to the old band, not muscicians who can bring their own style and verve to this thing. Pretty weak effort by all, unless Sumlin is himself to blame, as a control freak who did not have the vision to see what he was creating,something that had already been created 50 years before.  One redeeming quality of this cd is the final cut, an acoustic number that sounds as if some originality had been finally injected into the session. Sumlin is in need of an editor, or at least a confidant, who could have helped him with a better song selection or at least a better and more original way of handling these tunes. 
 I was sooooo disappointed.  I had high expectations for this book and found that it was really nothing more then stories told from a counselors chair.  This book told me nothing about how to overcome the problems, but instead focused on experiments conducted to account for jealous partners.  Truly a waste...there are other books out there that are much more useful 
 This novel is comprised of pretty, well constructed sentences.  That's about all it is.  Pretty, well constructed sentences.  The story itself could be interesting, after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested, let alone awake.  The narrator, although the main character, was so far removed, emotionally, from her own telling of the story, that you wondered why she had bothered.    At time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told.  
 If you child is not eating by mouth but by tube installed in his(her) body usually tummy then this book is just right for you. I have a 4 yr old food refuser and bought this book , first to make her eat , second to widen her food choice.  Author used so difficult language mostly related to feeding tubed children. Not worth to buy , if you child has no physical problems.  
 Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.    As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.    The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.    
 As a reader and cook who specializes in French cooking, I want to save fellow readers and cooks time and money. It is one of the worst books I've found about the subject. The pictures are cheap black and white  grainy shots of anything but the recipes. Her commentaries are boring and the recipes are disappointing. Don't bother 
 Maybe because the sizing is over seas, but these shoes were too small for me, not comfortable, I was very disappointed. Returned not exchanged because I would try shoes on first 
 I wanted to give this book a good review, but I cannot recommend it for a beginner. Like many readers, I came to it because I wanted to learn about philosophy and it was the only book on subject that I had heard of. The good news is that after 800 pages, I still wanted to learn more. The bad news is that I still knew very little.   The first problem is that the book has way too much breadth for a beginner. You do not need to spend 100 pages on Greek philosophy before even coming to Plato. For those that are interested in purchasing the book, I would suggest trimming the list to: Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Locke, Leibniz, Hegel, and then everything from Schopenhauer onwards.  The second problem is that the book is dated. Russell wrote it during World War II and there have been huge developments in philosophy since then. Some examples include the decline of the logicst program and logical positivism, the development of ordinary language philosophy, the later Wittgenstein, and a lot more on pragmatism beyond William James (such as Quine), and a rebirth of Christian philosophy from within the analytic and empirical traditions that Russell advanced (such as the works of Alvin Plantinga and William Lane Craig). It is standard for contemporary introductions to philosophy to cover most of these later developments.  A third problem has been well commented on by many other reviewers, which is Russell's bias and his dismissive treatment of philosophers that he does not agree with.   Finally, although histories have their place, they are not a good way to actually learn philosophy. Instead they are best used for becoming familiar with the major names and what they did. To actually learn philosophy you need an introductory book that directly focuses on the ideas.   My advice to someone new to philosophy is to buy 'An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis' by John Hospers. It is a gentle but rigorous textbook that is ideal for the first timer. It has a bias towards atheism, but theists should not pass up such a well-written book. Then follow it up with the even more rigorous and thorough 'Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview' by JP Moreland, even if you aren't a Christian. It has the best explanations of epistemology and metaphysics that I've seen. At that point you may want to get some logic under your belt, so if you are still ambitious, buy 'An Introduction to Logic' by Harry Gensler. The logicola software that accompanies the book is ideal for learning philosophical logic through self-study. 
 Mr. Dennett's book demonstrates the ignorance, irrationality, and dishonesty  of humanists. Discussing the meaning of word materialsim, Professor Dennett says:  "In its scientific or philosophical sense, it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial--like a Cartesian soul, or "ectoplasm"--or God. The standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic, which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance, matter and ...whatever minds are supposedly made of." (p. 302)  Philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics. A modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence.   The philosophy that God does not exist is not materialism, it is naturalism. Materialism is the view that all that exists is matter. Materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena. (In a quote below, you will see that Dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in.)  It is not clear from the book whether Dennett is a materialist, but he is certainly a naturalist. Concerning the proof of God's existence, he trots out David Hume's "Who made God?" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality. I refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof.  Let's look at two quotes, the first is at the end of the chapter "Belief in Belief" and the other at the beginning of the chapter "Morality and Religion":   "That is, isn't it true that, whether or not God exists, religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy, in the rule of law, in free will? The very widespread (but far from universal) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning." (p. 245)  " Without the divine carrot and stick, goes this reasoning, people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires, beak their promises, cheat on their spouses, neglect their duties, and so on.  There are two well-known problems with this reasoning: (1) it doesn't seem to be true, which is good news, since (2) is is such a demeaning view of human nature." (p. 279)  In the first chapter, he mentions "bulwark of morality" and "meaning." But in the second chapter, he leaves out "meaning."  If our purpose in life is not to get to heaven, what is our purpose is life?   Whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief. Mr. Dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist Christians.  There are worse things than divorcing your spouse. Disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said. Mr. Dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life.  The only miracle mentioned in Mr. Dennett's book is the Shroud of Turin, which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man.  Since no one claims to know how the image got there, it can be called a miracle. However, Mr. Dennett does not tell us anything about it. The reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet. 
 If you have had the opportunity to see the (out-of-print) show catalogue (Giorgio Morandi: [catalogue of] an exhibition of paintings, water-colours, drawings and etchings) this skimpy overview will not only disappoint, it also will not whet your appetite for more of this insightful artist's  oeuvre 
 This item was purchased for a 3 year old, and within minutes of play, the sides popped off, and we were never able to securely attach them again.  The heart clasp at the top also came off, and we were never able to get that to stay on either.  A toy that keeps falling apart is very disappointing for a 3 year old.  This item is in pieces, sitting in the bottom of a toybox 
 The author definitely has some issues with his father. It's always easiest to blame the parents. Although well organized, it's still a pretty cheap piece of whining. 
 I purchased the book believing by the title and the description that I was purchasing a cookbook featuring generally healthier recipes. When I received the book I was surprised to learn that they are all low carb recipes only. 
 First of all, this book mentions "the heart" and strays from the truth of scripture terribly. God's word says the "heart is deceitful above all things and who can know it?" There is nothing good in our hearts, apart from Christ, and whatever "good" there might be in there comes from Him. Scripture tells us that in the last days the church will go into apostasy. This time has come like no other time before. There is a move to to throw out scripture and move past it, ignoring what God has already told us. What we need to know is in scripture--especially those things we need to know about Him and what He requires of us. This move in the church today to "feel" God and go "to a deeper level" is a reawakening of mysticism which does not belong in the body of Christ. The truth and objectives of scripture are not mystical, for a reason. Jesus Christ was and is not a mystic. This movement is called "contemplative spirituality" and it is subtle and dangerous. Sadly, even Eldredge has taken this route. How many more good authors and great men of God are going to forsake the completeness of God's word to turn inward to "self" and think they will find something new? Solomon said, "there is nothing new under the sun." The devil wants us to think we can reinvent and invent "new" outside of God's marvelous confines. We need to stick to scripture and stop reading books like these written by men who want to offer us something more than the Lord commanded us. We are treading on shaky ground, but all we need is His glorious word and to do what He said: "Keep my commandments. 
 While the movie (for my niece and nephew,) was mildly amusing, it seemed to be a rip off of ideas from the "Tick" cartoon series, set in a high school.  The soundtrack- terrible! Why can't they leave the songs alone. I detest covers and remakes. The original artist inteneded it to be recorded the way they did. They did not intend to have some 20-something rocker wanna-bes butchering their vision. Were you really amused, or was your stomach churning, hearing these lame covers?   And why would high school kids be listening to 20+ year old music anyway. My niece and nephew were complaining that they didn't know any of the songs...  The only song worth listening to is the "They Might Be Giants" tune- finally something original on this CD!  Sorry if you are offended, but it had to be said- this is still America, where I can freely state my opinions and thoughts (especially when I am invited to give it in an open forum! 
 This unit works great.. for a couple of months. I don't know if it's the rain or heat (neither is suppose to bother it), but after a couple of months, it simply quits sensing the barking. It gets to the point that you have to hit the sensor hole directly to get it to even trigger. In addition, the label starts to shrivel up.. a sign that it can't really handle the weather. I've sent 7 of these back.. now Smarthome is smart enough to not even carry them. Stay away from this dog 
 After reading most of the Dragonlance books, I finally bought this trilogy. I wasn't expecting much, and I didn't get it. It's a bad sign when your book has 15 pages left with no resolution in sight. Or when you have a "slideshow" telling what happened to the characters because you ran out of space. How many times did these paperdoll characters get burned, scarred, run through and mortally wounded just to get revived by the healer? How many times did we get detailed descriptions of their new outfits but not real personalities? Despite the good idea of dragon overlords, how come no one deals with the problem of food? At the rate they eat, Ansalon should have no people or livestock left. But that, along with so many plot points, is just part of the mystery. Maybe that mystery is why five dragons let a band of humanoids poke, prod and wound them, then let them leave. It's too bad Jean Rabe had to introduce unbeatable, unkillable monsters and found them more fascinating than the characters we had to read about for three books 
 I honestly can't understand the glowing reviews this book has gotten by self-reported fans of 24.  I truly doubt the writer has actually seen the show himself.  He does not have a grasp whatsoever on the characters.  For example, the character of Nina Meyers, who was one of my favorite characters, even after she was exposed as a mole in the first season.  He seems to be completely  unaware of, or willfully disregard the fact tht CTU is a military organization and there are protocols that are followed.  For that matter, the banter between agents does not ring true to the 24 that I know and love.  Here are a few examples from the book:    -- on Page 179, Nina walks into the conference room where Jack and Kelly are discussing the situation and says "You're going to want to make out with me when I show you this."  She then follows that up, after divulging her information, with "Am I not the sexiest woman alive at the moment?"  What? Seriously, what?  Nina was always a smart cookie, sharp as a tack and she wasn't blatant about flaunting her sexuality at work.  Despite the fact that she had affairs with two co-workers, while she was at work, she demanded respect.  That aspect of her character is wholly absent in this novel.    -- on Page 276 Nina is checking out an apartment of a suspect while the teenage building manager stands in the doorway and watches. She turns to him and asks "Aren't you going to ask me what this is all about?" to which he replies "You work for the government right?" and she says "Yes."  He then asks if what she tells him could get him killed, to which she also replies "Yes." and he smartly refuses to get involved.  So you're telling me that some teenage apartment manager is smarter than a trained agent  who should have, and likely would have, told him to mind his own business had he asked?  Not likely.    Besides his frequent use of language that is not used in 24 (the f-bombs got old really quickly), he introduces too many new characters for this to read true.  Nina and Chapelle are the only characters who are present for nearly the whole novel.  Jamie and Tony make an entrance 3/4 of the way in.  You don't have to bring Kim into it to make it believable.  Actually, the only positive thing I have to say about this novel as it pertains to 24 is that he *didn't* bring in Kim or Terri.  This novel focused less on personal relationships and more on the plot.  But that's where my positive feedback begins and ends.   This novel reads, at best, as a mediocre political thriller.  1/3 of the way through the book I could see where it was going and ultimately where it ended.  The beauty of 24 is that there are many twists, and this just didn't have that many that were surprising or relevant.   There were twists, but they were twists for twists sake and didn't actually alter the course of the plot. I think the authors political views were transparent as well, and while I may agree with some of  them, I read these novels not to be beat over the head by current political events but as a means of being entertained.  If I want relevant political commentary, this is not the author I would choose.  If you want a 24 novel that reads more fluidly and more like a season of 24, check out Operation Hell Gate by Mark Cerasini.  Pass this one up, unless you're so absolutely desperate for a 24 fix that anything will do.  
 I bought this book imagining how much easier and heathier meal planning could be.  What I discovered, after spending $120 for the first week of menus, was that this is not for me.  I spent 1.5 hours in the kitchen on the first night of cooking!  I am a very busy, working mom.  I do not have that much time to spend on preparation, nor the money to spend over $100 per week on food items that I only use a portion of then throw away!  I need a meal plan that re-uses leftovers (i.e., most of the english muffins in a bag instead of just one) and is more time/cost conscientious.  Hopefully, I will have better luck with my next purchase 
 The Worlds biggest and safest oil rig is ready to drill on unstable ocean floor in the Arctic.  Bad move.  In a scene from Deep Star Six, the drilling opens up a huge cavern that is teeming with life that has gone extinct elsewhere 60-70 million years ago.  One life form is a megalodon which leaves the rich feeding ground of the cave for the more barren waters of the Arctic (would you like a bridge with that?).  Actually the first shark evidence, a shadow, does not appear until 47 minutes into the movie.  The rig and the small cast are now at risk from a powerful predator.  Mistakes abound in this film in unexpected ways.  I am used to these film getting the extinction dates wrong but this one got it right.  However, it does play heck with a lot of other details.  Imagine a body at 5,000 feet down that does not suffer from the pressure.  Imagine and elevator and subs that travel the 5,000 feet from surface to ocean floor in a matter of minutes.  Imagine a shark that has no internal organs (it is solid like a statue).  Imagine planning rescue boats that have to be dropped bow first sixty feet to the water (and have wounded aboard).  Watch visitors get invited to a dinner with no food and everyone leaves at the start.  The disk is very barren.  Just play movie and a chapter selection.  No trailers, commentary, behind the scenes (although it is credited in the credits), no nothing 
 Colmes is an invention by FAUX NEWS!!! He cant even be considered a FAUX liberal because he was invented to be Pawn Hannity's...uh pawn so he can announce that there will be a commercial during their so called liberal/conservative talk show. This book was so mind numbingly..uh..dull and as Faux as Colmes himself..he oughtta banish himself for such buffonry 
 This book offers some nice information, but to subculture, sex-centered gays. I was really disappointed at some topics such as bisexuality and sex with animals!!! Thats not what I expect in my gay sex. So clearly, buy this book ONLY if your life revolves around sex. I now regret I bought this book 
 For some reason I don't believe this book.  The whole book seems like some kind of hoax - a planned event.  There are several wonderful places a man going through a mid-life crisis can explore on a motorcycle to find himself; Glen seems begging for all of these horrible things to happen to him.  The author is a bit full of himself and his uncultured descriptions of the places and faces he encounters are a complete bore.  I admit that when I purchased this book I was searching for the innocent escape I reaped by reading "Jupiter's Travels" by Ted Simon, not an ego charged, made for t.v. action adventure 
 Bought this awhile back and forgot I had it. Watched it and then I rememebered how AWFUL it was. Was about to throw it out and then thought maybe I could reuse the case? 
 I have found it very challenging to get through this book.  It is written in a very academic style and focuses considerably on previous research.  I cannot understand from the discussion exactly what is being put forward as relevant understandings in today's world.  I wish I had a dollar for every time the author says 'as I argued in...'  or 'what I will argue in...'.  This is driving me nuts. I have had a couple of tries at ploughing through this book but I just can't cope with the writing style 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 This game sounded so promising on the box but when my 6 year old go it for Christmas last year we were very disappointed.  The sticks break easily and they are hard to put and and very time consuming to do also.  She was bored with it before we could get the sticks in.  It is to difficult for her to set up by herself.  SAVE YOUR MONEY 
 I've read Roemer's other book: 'Accardo'.  Roemer's biggest problem is that he fails to take himself out of his books, insisting on intermingling his own stories with those of his subjects. With 'Accardo' Roemer had a lot of strong data (he really knew Tony `Joe Batters' Accardo  the 50 year Don of Chicago's Outfit), so in that book's case, he could get away with such mixings, mainly because he belonged mingled somewhat within his story (limits which I think Roemer crossed very often).   But in 'The Enforcer' Roemer seemed almost as if he'd obtained most of his information from second hand sources. Here this continuous digression into his own history further dilutes an already weak factual accounting of his subject: Tony 'The Ant' Spillatro.   In short in The Enforcer it was as if Roemer were merely trying to add some girth to an otherwise 'thin' book 
 I LOVE that it comes with matching food containers, a thermos, and a separate storage area on front.  I also love the idea of the thermos design with a pop-up built-in staw.  My son really enjoyed the whole package in the beginning.  However, the functionality of the thermos rests with a flimsy tab of plastic in the flip-open top.  Ours broke pretty quicky and now it won't close at all.  It has been rendered useless for travel.  We've only owned it for a few months and already the images are badly scratched and worn.  While I give them points for the great design ideas, the lack of durability is simply unacceptable.  I would not buy one like this again 
 I own several ballet videos.  I have taken ballet for many years and use videos when there are no classes available.  This would be the last one I would grab.  It's doable but the explanations are poor and the video is frustrating to watch.  The camera person zooms in too much and makes it hard to follow along.  The sequences are poorly put together.  I much prefer David Howard or Dimitri R. ballet videos.  They are wonderful if you know ballet.  I hope I will find more challenging tapes out there 
 I have read Deborah Tannen's first 2 books and I found them groudbreaking and very informative.  This book however seems to be too much of a rehash of her first 2 books with a little bit of business communication stuck in the middle.  I was disappointed by the book and believe there are better books out there than this one 
 I'll be honest -- after reading 50 pages of this book, I got off the StairMaster at the gym, put the book in my bag, and had no interest in reading any more of it. It just wasn't that interesting. It read more like a history of the Bhagwan Rajneesh, and less a story about Guest's childhood experiences. If you want to read about horrifying childhoods or kids in cults, try "Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress" by Susan Jane Gilman or "Running with Scissors" by Augusten Burroughs. Either one is a more entertaining and less laborious to read 
 I purchased this in May 2006.  I was so happy to have an organized way to store the leappad, books and cartridges.  I was happy until August 2006 when the zipper broke.  I've tried fixing it a few times, but it keeps breaking.  It's useless without the zipper because everything just falls out.  Not worth the money or my time trying to repair it 
 I was a bit excited to get a copy of this book as I've heard a good deal about it.  So I picked up a copy and read it in a day which is a bit unusual for me.  All in all I was extremely disapointed in every aspect imaginable.  Donald Miller spends the entire book rambling as if he were on an acid trip.  His jesus seems to be more the type of say a hispanic fellow (Heyzeus)who sells drugs down on the corner.  He preaches a gospel of love without justice; one in which a hippie jesus comes over and wants to chat and share his bong with you.  Holiness is apparently not all that important, but then again love is all that matters.  Blue like Jazz is a waste of time and a hindrance to anyone's spiritual growth.. 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 Page 22: "Important Note: Since the events of September 9, 2001, to ensure the safety of your flight the airline rules have changed dramatically..."    Although the parts I did read I enjoyed, this seemed like rather a large error and made me question the accuracy of the rest of the information. Unless I missed something in the news on 9/9/01 
 The style of the book is extremely disappointing. There's nearly nothing new in the book. It's an old wine in the new (and poor) bottle. 
 Hello, delivery was prompt but the product is poor quality.  The dowls do not fit into the support frame so the whole thing falls apart.  i would appreciate a refund 
 Contributors to this fine anthology of male authors would be far better served without the unnecessary and cloying tailpieces tacked onto their work by Author-Publisher Sarah Ban Breathnach. The jacket photo of foxy Sarah tells it all. The girl's gotta have the last word 
 We were led to believe that this book was geared for children because of the trading cards included.  However, the subject matter is crude and offensive on many pages.  I would definitely not recommend this book for children.  I also think that the contents reflect the downward spiral in our culture and therefore, would not recommend it for adults either 
 ANANSI BOYS by Neil Gaiman Review by Nickolas Cook  	For those familiar with Gaiman's past work, like me, you've probably come to appreciate his intelligent humor, story telling ï¿½lan, and philosophical bent on the human condition.  With "Anansi Boys" he again proves all of those qualities and more. 'Fat' Charlie Nancy is the disgruntled son of the forgotten African god, Anansi (we met him in Gaiman's masterpiece to date, "American Gods"), a mischievous spider deity, who stole all of the stories of creation from Tiger, the dark and violent god of blood and death.  'Fat' Charlie receives news that his father has passed away and rushes from England to Florida to find his father was no mere human.  And as if that's not bad enough to ruin his day, he also discovers he's got a lost brother called Spider.  Given the incantation to draw his brother to him by a trio of old hags, much like MacBeth's cackling witches, he gets more than he bargained for when his impishly suave brother appears and begins to steal his life, his career, and his fiancï¿½ right out from under him. Gaiman does mythology like no other author, dragging us from one world to the next in search of honor and love, making the cosmic drama of gods more human.  But what he does even better is examine familial love and commitment to a calling higher than one's self.  For 'Fat' Charlie soon finds that he can't ignore his heritage anymore than he can his brother.  He is part of the pantheon, whether he fancies it or not, and, after a bargain made in angry frustration, must battle to save his bloodline from eternal death. Gaiman's prose is top notch, fast paced, edited to the essentials, with enough descriptive passages to make the story blossom in full, but not enough to stifle the pace.  There are some rather out of place scenes with the spirit of a murdered woman that tend to dishevel the almost perfect fairytale quality of the story, but given that all's well that end's well, it can be forgiven. "Anansi Boys" doesn't have anywhere near the broad canvas feel of "American Gods" and the extraordinary "Neverwhere", but fits nicely along side his "Stardust".  It's a fun read, full of humor and great characters, but his fans may miss that mythical cosmic sense provided by  some of his other fiction.  --Nickolas Cook 
 My 1st grader said it best: "Cute pictures, but scary story!" She had tears in her eyes as she realized the Mama was gone and the baby was alone. He gets a new mama when he's rescued, but the ghostly outline of his lost mother is present on the last page. Yikes. Terrible for little ones, brings up a whole host of frightening topics 
 If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!!  The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale.  The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt.  A great read if you're looking for nightmares.  
 I love all the other Little Bear books in her series but this one was strange.  I'm sure that 30 years ago it wouldn't have seemed odd to tell your child a story about kisses being passed from one person to another but in today's age it just left a strange feeling with me esp at the part where the skunks kept kissing eachother back & forth.  At least they get married at the end of the story.  I took it back to the libray.  Glad I didn't buy it.  I own all the others she wrote however and love them 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 I heard about this book on the radio and was very excited, since I love cooking and hate fast food. This book is overpriced and overproduced. The information about "slow food" is interesting, but could have been a long magazine article--just doesn't warrant oversized full-color treatment. There are very few recipes. I recommend the recent regional Italian cookbook, Rustico, by Mikol Negrin, a real treasure trove of slow recipes 
 while not one of his best novels, tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time! jimmy smits does his best,but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble!! SKIP IT!!!! 
 I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much.  It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather. I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate. Dumpster fodder. 
 Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended 
 Fans of the Babys will be better off with the more complete collection of hits found on "Anthology."  More than half of the tracks on this CD never even charted, and where's the band's breakthrough single, "Isn't It Time" 
 Bennett's own logic undermines itself. He is in essence arguing that to be a truly patriotic American, one must check your brains in at the door and unquestioningly accept everything our government tells us. Welcome to the machine.  Our country was founded on the premise that individuals should have the capability to think for themselves and critique those in power. It's time that we rediscovered that to appropriately confront those in power is true American patriotism 
 Gad!  Such a looooooong book!  This would better be called "A Year (or Maybe 5) in Only Part of the World" since most of the places visited were European.  Long-winded and loopy with adjectives, Mayes writes about food, literature, food, art, food, architecture, and food.  I'm surprised she and her husband don't roll around the places they visit - they must each weigh a ton or two by now.  I did enjoy the descriptions of the crazy Italian traffic HOWEVER I got a wee bit tired of hearing how fantastic European cities are compared to poor little ole' San Francisco.  Traffic bad in Portugal?  Look at San Francisco!  Beggars in Naples?  Just look at San Francisco!  No place is perfect, and I'd much rather read travel stuff written by someone who has a more balanced prospective.  
 Perhaps this collection of sounds might be an interesting experiment in what you can get the public to buy, but it certainly isn't music. Some might call this progressive or some other term to denote a lack of musical ability, which presumes that only those of great artistic sensibility can really appreciate the work; I call it worthless 
 I must admit I was skeptical when I first opened this book based on previous knowledge I had of MPD.  This book made me that much more skeptical.  In most cases of MPD or DID as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist.  This case is different though.  On page 67 of the paperback copy I got, Ms Chase describes Stanley(her name for Phillips) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other.  Her answer that she or as she claims her "troops" give is that it is through the use of "thought transference" which was known to the ancient Greeks as she tells us later on.  I almost burst out laughing when I read that.  She also contradicts her claim that the alters don't know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters Rabbit and Sister Mary Catherine at the same time.  Another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as 'we'.  Many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies.  The abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic.  Her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories, ufo sightings, satanic ritual abuse, and second sight.  I think she is not credible in the least.  There is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them.  She does let us know in the book that she is very creative, artistic, intelligent, and apparently well read.  I think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities.  The book itself is long, boring, anti-climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end.  She also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities.  Don't waste your money on this book, unless you have to read it for a class as I did.  
 There is an annoying New Agey belief grown out of religious quests for redemption and salvation that states that not only can everyone be saved, everyone is wonderful and only big mean society makes them act badly. This is the kind of thinking that allows bad men (and women) to empty out bank accounts, kill their spouses and excuse every one of their actions.   This movie takes an intriguing concept - Portrait of Hitler as a Young Artist - and sinks it into the morass of this kind of thinking. He's an angry man trying to make it in the art world, but basically he's a good kid. He just needs a patron to support him. Unfortunately that patron gets the tar beat out of him before he can show Hitler's Autobahn as art. So Hitler decided to go with the more validating politics thing and see where that got him.   Not only do you never get the feeling that Hitler is anti-semitic or dangerous in this movie, you never get the feeling that he was a man capable of using rhetoric to excite or sway audiences. This is a man that convinced an entire country to commit mass murder and this movie portrays him as a slug.  Furthermore, Hitler never seems to take any responsibility for his actions. I know that sounds silly, but this movie has Hitler walking around, making speeches, drawing pictures and somehow the rising Nazism in Germany has nothing to do with him. It's just happening outside of his realm.   Worse, John Cusack plays the role as Rob Gordan from High Fidelity. Cusack is a good actor, but this movie takes place in 1918, not 1999. The character is not an angsty record store owner; he's a veteran whose seen more death than most can imagine. The movie doesn't even draw on the relationship between Max and Hitler as fellow veterans.  At the end of the movie you're left with the impression that Hitler was a sad little boy who could have been a great artist if only given half a chance. But instead, he went to the big speech making and killed half of Europe. Doesn't really play well.  For a good movie about Hitler that focuses on both Hitler as a person and a force of history (and a man capable of wooing others to his cause) try to see if the CBS miniseries starring Robert Carlisle of Trainspotting fame is available. 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 The article that receipt is difrente to that of the photo that appears. The conector to the camera is not USB/Fire Wire, but it is a type nini Stereo 
 I'll be honest and say I only listened to about 4 tracks off this album, and I found it so awful, it was actually painful for me to listen to it. Lou sounded like he was spontaneously handed a microphone to entertain some buddies so he decided to make words up on the spot and ramble a bit. Not only that, but his voice wasn was weak, dull, and just plain bad. I know he's over 60 years old, but if you can't give a good show, there's no reason to get up on that stage! So terribly disappointed. 
 I'd have to wonder how many trees were cut down to write this dribble?  On the other hand, in case it gets cold out there and I run out of logs...it could be useful.  But if George Bush had the (D) after his name instead of (R), the same people who hate him would be wanting to have his baby 
 This is a USB speakerphone of the worst quality I've ever seen. The sound quality is bad. My partner can hardly hear what I said. It is not the loudness but the echo. I will not recommend this speakerphone to anyone. 
 I can't claim to be a hardcore metal fan, but The Haunted has always been one of my concessions to the genera simply for the sheer speed and brutality of their songs.    That's just the problem.  Neither of these things describes The Dead Eye.  This album sounds like dozens of other watered down radio-metal bands that I can hear at any given moment in my car.  There's not a single "Bury Your Dead" or even a "Sweet Relief" present on this disc.  Every song is slow and trudging.  The vocals are almost all sung, which isn't bad in and of itself, however the singing sounds like an imitation of Days of the New or some other second-rate grunge band.    This isn't about keeping an open mind or allowing a band to progress (though, in this case, they've certainly regressed.)  It's about the severe disappointment of expecting one thing that has been great in the past and getting just the opposite.    This may as well be a different band. 
 Being desperate for ideas as to what to make my 13 year old son who is on a Candida Diet, I thought I had found a gold mine on discovering this book. I was disappointed, however, when I checked with my naturopath regarding  the safety of vegetable glycerin, and was told that it could cause diarrhea  and/or dehydration, and he suggested that I look for an alternative  sweetener.  I have had some success using Ms. Burton's recipes substituting  stevia.  But thanks for trying, Ms. Burton, for so many of us this is a  recurring problem 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 Seems that all the book does is Talk bad about the reagan years and the Republicans.  I think that the author needs to come back and look at other years under different presidents 
 I could hardly believe this film was being high-listed for possible DVD release during the Amazon.com voting...  let's be honest, it is not that good a movie (neither acting nor plot nor cinematography), unless you have an intense need to see some gymnastics and Kurt Thomas.  But do make a point of reading VICSARJOO's review, for a delicious satire of over-blown and mis-guided reviews.  If you enjoy that review (one of my favorites) there are some other classics by him if you link to his other reviews, though some seem a little half-hearted compared to this review by him.   Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is another fine example of his dry wit.  Thank you VICSARJOO for making me smile 
 It's hard to figure out which review point to what...  Why doesn't Amazon.com simply leave reviews for this volume instead of linking to other books in the series.  It makes it confusing to figure out if this hardcover edition is worth buying over the paperbacks... 
 One of the authors of this book is Mr. Philip Watts, chairman of Shell until 2003. He left the company after it was revealed that under his mandate, Shell has inflated its oil reserves by 20%, with his knowledge and influence. Although the book seems consistent and based on real facts, his presence as an author make it a bit unreliable. I did not realize he is one of the authors. If I  knew it, I would never buy it. Check "Chapter 2 - The Right Framework",  particulalrly the item "Transparency and Accountability" and then check the reports on Mr Watts' activities and behaviour at Shell.      How can one trust on what reads?? 
 I wonder whether Terry Goodkind has fallen into the Anne Rice and JK Rowling trap of selling so many books that editors don't dare to interfere with them anymore. Any sane editor would have told Terry Goodkind to cut about 200 pages of this novel. Cutting the endless speeches and repetition of the same points over and over again might have helped make this book somewhat up to the standards Mr. Goodkind has set by the previous books of the series (except Pillars of Creation, which, frankly, I skipped). The narrative is long-winded, the endless exposition is tiring and the repetition of Richard's - questionable - moral lesson at every given chance sinks the book in a quagmire of all talk and no action. The plot is ridiculous, and the final resolution cheap and lazy.  I must confess I'm growing tired of the way Goodkind writes Richard and Kahlan. He underuses the latter and makes the former into a terribly boring stiff. Where's the spark?  Somehow the air's gone out of Sword of Truth somewhere in the second half of Faith of the Fallen, and I only hope Goodkind will get it back to finish off the series as strongly as it's started. 
 Going through Pilgrim at Tinker Creek with Annie Dillard I observed her skillful employment of imagery and figurative language. The use of personification, similes and metaphors elevates this relatively boring story to a kaleidoscope of color and exploration. From a frog being sucked dry to peaceful eye to eye night on the rocks with a copperhead snake, Dillard excites and dramatizes with unique sentence structure and personal anecdotes. The book is pregnant with telegraphic sentences and a recurring circle effect of topics. For the skillful writing and deep thought, I hold a certain admiration and understanding of this book's praise. However I see little else to justify Pilgrim at Tinker Creek's winning of a Pulitzer Prize. 	Dillard's knowledge of other prevalent literature and religious books is highly noticeable throughout Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. She alludes to the Bible quite a few times in addition to the Korean and many other works, including her predecessor, Henry David Thoreau. Oddly enough, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek bears an uncanny resembles to Thoreau's Walden. However Dillard's book lacks the same exploration into intellectual philosophy. Both books delve into the natural world with real lust for knowledge and superior curiosity. The book has a short fall, in that it lacks any real substance. Full of fleshy descriptions it lacks any real soul of a thesis. Compared to Walden it is essentially similar, but Walden at least has some relevant information about human nature. 	So if the microscope study the natural world is a good read, then this book is for you. The details in the book on insects are fairly cacophonous, which includes the mating ritual of the praying mantis. I cannot see how the book is enjoyable, except for those harboring a deep love of nature. For everyone who does not fit into the extreme nature category it probably will not be very catchy, but it will of essence capture an admiration for its style and imagery 
 you will most definitely, never ever EVER know how to draw those bodacious babes of comics after studying this book! the drawings are god-awful and the "lesson plan" has more holes in it than Robert Davi's face (haha!!) all of the advice is weird and really useless, like telling you draw beautiful women for like four hours a day and fill "sketchbooks full of drawings of hands". so does being a comic book artist mean you have to keep a bodybuilder's schedule? The worst feature is the chapter on computers. Why would somebody who is still trying to learn drawing skills need to even begin to worry about cheesy computer effects? seriously, wasted paper guys. It says on the back the artist has "been in the feild for years", but you would think that after looking at his illustrations for this book that this is his sole commision. The only pleasure I got from reading this book is from seeing that so many other people agree that this book is garbage. Don't buy it. 
 Oh my gosh,this book was a pain.The first 200 pages were ok but after that,the story loses heat and dragged on without a plot.The writing was mediocre and lazy as if he were in a rush to finish this book.Also,Banks was a very unlikeable character.He was lusting after Pamela when he was already married,he got into a fight in a pub and he came across as a very unsentimental man.Other than that,the detectives in this book,other than Susan,were just plain barbaric.They acted like criminals instead of detectives.And the part about the "shaved pussies"was totally disgusting.All in all,the book was a pain to read.The contrived plot,mediocre writing plus all the unlikeable characters just make this a very bad book 
 This was very dissapointing!! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it. the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade. The mat looks like it comes from the dollar store, or they ran out of color at the factory. My daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one....not like the box or commercial! 
 I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters. He goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for "the swede", without letting us know who the Swede really is. Roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration. It gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. I loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times 
 First of all, I recommend everyone to read the book in order to have an idea where a lot of modern day values come from.   The book recognizes a problem women (as well as all other humans) have to deal with: how to find fulfillment in life. The problem is that Friedan seems to think this problem only concerns housewives and stay at home moms, and that the problem could be solved by those women getting jobs outside the home. An interesting hypothesis, but judging by today's women, clearly wrong. There are plenty of career women that feel rather unfulfilled.   She describes the problem as women slaving away to keep the house perfectly clean and the kids perfectly taken care of, and then getting depressed as a result. They do this out of a perceived societal pressure. To me, the solution seems to be to check whether this is really what their kids and husband want. In reality, probably no-one cares whether you wash the windows once per week or once per month, so you could spend that time thinking about your values in order to raise your kids as moral individuals, or learning about current events, so that you can actually have a real conversation with your husband, or reading a book for fun.   Getting a job because you're feeling unfulfilled trying to outperform Martha Stewart is as much of an escape tactic as becoming an alcoholic. Being a teacher is as much "living through others" as being a mother is. Shuffling papers around like people with average office jobs doesn't intrinsically give any more fulfillment than making a healthy meal for your spouse and kids does.  The book did some good in promoting equal rights for men and women, but also caused a harmful movement that indoctrinates modern girls and women that the *only* path to fulfillment is through employment, which is clearly nonsense. Housewives and mothers can be really valuable to society, which can give them a strong sense of fulfillment.  Aside from the above, the research Friedan did to back up her point was rather bad and biased, with frequent misuse of statistics. A list of factual errors and omissions in her book is listed on this website:  cf.en.cl  In conclusion, the book is important as a historical document, but has to be approached with extreme caution. One could call it propaganda.  - 22yo housewife and part-time science/engineering majo 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 design of book is very poor--pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story.  The translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex 
 Slow, confusing, not very believable, (and to top it off Pink is beyond irritating).  I was very disappointed in this installment in the Irene Adler series.  As a long time fan I have been quite disappointed in the last two book 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 Tedious and inane come to mind. It is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a "catty" pseudo-feminist style, rambling descriptions of Egyptian archaeology - real or imagined - thinly veiled racist comments about the "ignorant natives" of Egypt and inept sexual innuendo. The book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced. The characters do not come across as real.  Very disappointing. Leave this one on the library shelf 
 Although this CD is not nearly as bad as Sylvia Hotel, I find foolishness like the Prozac song to be pathetic and clearly beneath the considerable talents of Ms. Wheeler. Unfortunately as can been seen in her live concerts in recent years she is much more concerned with being a comedian than the stunning singer/songwriter that she is capable of being. Id pass on this disc. Go buy "Driving Home' or "Half A Book" It genuinely saddens me to see such talent squandere 
 I feel they should have called this movie "Punisher and Friends". Yes, I loved how they had the punisher move into his new apartment and make friends with his quirky and lovable neighbors. He even joined them for dinner, but still remembered to keep a frown on his face(he's still hell bent on vengeance you see). It was also great how the villains were able to do battle with him by simply driving to his apartment, how convenient. But what truly made this movie legend was the deeply moving dramatic performances of Rebecca Romijn, especially that scene where she is attempting to portray an actress crying near the end of the movie. I love when I feel embarrassed for an actor when they are attempting to perform. And the Popsicle torture gag was simply delightful (wink,wink,nudge,nudge). You silly punisher, even though your life has been senselessly destroyed you still know how to play a good practical joke. I was so excited to see this movie, but I was simply orgasmic when I realized how much they had watered the story down and turned it into Punisher Lite 
 ...From what i have seen it looks very very roughly based on the book. The book is very good (even though I am to old to read it :P ) and from what i have seen of the film it looks awful compared to the original story. The actress they chose for Ella was a bad choice. Anne is a good actress but here she is playing more a "princess Diaries" girl, which is a clumsy, sometimes cringeworthy and not a very strong character and not Ella who although is obedient has courage and is a strong character. If they were going to make a film on the book they should have stuck to the story much more. What is up with the freezing in mid-air, evil uncle and Ella going out to stop the segregation?!?! This film is a bit too much like Shrek whereas when reading the book, the funny green ogre did not cross my mind. I wish someone would attempt at making a better version as it is an amazing book and shouldn't have its name ruined by the film. However, enough about the film (stupid as it is) and lets focus on the soundtrack. One word - Brill! Songs are good and Anne Hatheway does have a good voice (not too high tho please!) Shame some people won't ever get round to the soundtrack due to the film... Feel free to contradict or argue xD I shall be waiting... : 
 It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original.  My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered.  Don't order this product 
 I borrowed this book from the library, and am I glad I didn't buy it.  From the first page to the last page, this book is one silly, stupid, and meaningless fight. I read the first several chapters and then I gave up. I skimmed through the rest, still hoping that this story would get better. But it was just a waste of my time. Stefan all throughout the story calls Tanya a whore, which really put me off. Not to mention all his angst over a scar on his cheek, one would think he had a hideous deformation or something. And Tanya was very childish and annoying. And both of them were selfish, and irritating.  Even the supporting characters were shallow and selfish. All the characters are not likable in the least, and the storyline is pointless, annoying, and weak.  Not good at all.   If you enjoy reading romances that are meaningful, moving, suspenseful, adventurous, with good plots, entertaining and strong storylines with likable and real characters, then skip this silly book. Reading it is a waste of time. If you want to check it out, borrow it from the library, save your money 
 Karen Armstrong, some of whose other books I've found illuminating, really fails here in a big way. This book presents a whitewashed picture, a romanticised history of the founder of Islam. She carries on about "islamophobia" and the crusades but is silent about the Islamic incursions into Europe centuries before the crusades. In other words, she ignores Islamic imperialism. Unfortunately, it soon becomes clear that the entire book is a compendium of half-truths, distortions, omissions and wishful thinking.   The chapters are titled Mecca, Jahilliyah, Hijrah, Jihad and Salam. There are 2 maps, notes, and a glossary without the word Dhimmitude, which is very telling. The book lacks an index. The author paints Islam as a religion of peace and reconciliation and incorrectly states that the word means "peace." The real meaning of Islam is "submission", as I'm sure Ms Armstrong must know very well. She also insists on interpreting the word Jihad as "struggle" in the sense of personal struggle, ignoring the numerous sayings preserved in the hadith that indicate the opposite.  What I found most shocking was Armstrong's attempts to whitewash the murder of the men of the Jewish Qurayzah tribe and the selling of the children and women into slavery. She denies Muslim anti-semitism and the inferior status and sometimes active persecution of Non-Muslims - as noted before, you won't easily find the word Dhimmi in this book. Her defence of polygamy is unconvincing and comprises many pages painful to read. The tone of the book is quite touchy-feely, supported by highly selective quotes from the Quran.   One wonders whether Karen Armstrong deliberately engages in intellectual dishonesty or if she just lives in a make-believe world where the frame of reference is multiculturalism, relativism and postmodernism. This book is flled with distortions and romantic delusions. To get a more balanced perspective, I highly recommend The Truth About Mohammed by Robert Spencer, Islamic Imperialism by Efraim Karsh, The Force Of Reason by Oriana Fallaci and the work of Bat Ye'or and Ayaan Hirsi Ali 
 This would be a great wireless mouse if it weren't for it's battery usage. It runs on dual AAA batteries. They need replacing about every 2-3 weeks. I DO NOT recommend this mouse. Instead of adding to my large collection of AAA batteries, I'm purchasing another mouse that handles battery usage efficiently.

 This book has a fairly annoying layout which refers back to information not previously mentioned.  The examples are also fairly overly complex, there are much simpler ways to solving the problems.  Regardless, it was a required book 
 Tipler says many times "as I have proved".  Huh? What the f is he talking about?  There is no proof in this stinking pile of filth.  He's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book-I'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense, but I don't think it should matter.  I am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts, and Tipler just doesn't make any sense.  His writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time.  The more books you read, the sooner you know when to stop reading, put the book down, and read a work of fiction instead, which can play with such ideas without boring you to death 
 Don't believe the hype.  This book is not a masterpiece, but if you are able to stick through the piles of metaphorical images that are at moments beautiful but most often don't quite make sense together and make it to the end of this novel you'll be pleased to find some actual action and true emotion in Justine.  It took me a very long time to read through the first half of this book.  The narrator is irritatingly affected and the writing drags with a myriad of descriptions that are uneffective at creating a cohesive picture.  But what kept me going were Durrell's secondary characters.  He has a nack for capturing and creating quirkiness that borders on bizarre and his stories of the more minor men and women in Justine are striking, emotional, and entertaining.  I am glad that I was able to make it to the end of the novel (there is a hospital scene that made it all worth while), but I do regret that I recommended this novel to my bookgroup and I do not plan to complete the quartet 
 want to watch a sexy comedy about young teenage boys fantasising over their older female housekeeper? then don't bother watching this, it's cute and stuff, with a few shots of breasts, but really, any movie with Jason Biggs is far better, i mean this isn't even sexy or funn 
 A big fan of Lehane, I was LOVING this book in the beginning, thinking to myself what a great choice I had made buyingit.It was interesting, funny, etc and seemed to be leading to a very compelling mystery to solve.  Midway thru the book, things got a bit vague as I was not able to figure out how some of the various happeneings connected with each other, but I was relieved when the 2 main charachters, Patrick and Angie, were also questioning the events themselves, not knowing what to make of them. Expecting things to come together from that point on and become a bit more focused, the plot got even more convoluted.  I continued reading  for the hell of it but I have finished the book and still not sure who was intended dead in the car "accident" (Trevor or his wife?) as well as who was really after who.When Jay Becker returned from Nantucket and knew Desiree was alive, Trevor then sent him to Florida to find her and kill her.  Why would Jay accept an assignment to kill? He was  one of the "good guys", right? In addition, a few holes were left in the plot (eg. when the "Weeble" and the chaffeur (I think his name was Cushing) were killed on the bridge in Florida, the police search reported they were residents of Atlanta ,(NOT employed by Trevor) and that their neighbors had seen the almost every day.  Yet earlier in the book the Weeble was definitely part of Trevors squad of cronies- this was never cleared up.. I was left quite frustrated by this book and because of it may never read Lehane again.  Anyone agree 
 I really enjoyed Stringer's Grand Center Winter and am a life-long fan of Vonnegut. But I was terribly disappointed by this edited transcript from a couple of conversations between the two writers. Given the great potential  of such gifted writers, this book seems little more than mutual admiration;  it's short on substance or gravity and provides little insight to those of  us who may be interested in the art of writing. I would have probably felt  far better about this if it had been, instead, a magazine piece. But at  this price I expected more substance 
 This movie has some excellent acting, starting with the always wonderful Michael Caine, and some very funny moments, but it lacks one important ingredient: a script.  The story beings promisingly and then just slowly evaporates. Worth watching if you are an inveterate Caine fan or feel nostalgic about that Caribbean island you visited. 
 Wow, talk about an insult to intelligence.  When you read this book you say "Duh" as you read it.  The online quizes coulde be helpful, but using a character called "Answer Man" makes you feel like you are in first grade.  If you really feel you need help with your writing skills, don't get this book.  Try something else, anything else, but this book 
 Ok, well maybe I'm a cookbook snob, but I couldn't fathom some of these "recipes". Baked Brie?  I mean come on... who needs a recipe to put a wheel of Brie into the oven??  Or putting sausage in the oven with mustard slathered all over it, or rolling up some chicken and mustard in a lettuce leaf.  These are more IDEAS but RECIPES???  I will admit to loving Bon Appetit and Jacques and Julia, so you'll need to relate there to get me.  Plus, most of their recipes call for "teriyaki sauce"???  It's like my grandma making hundreds of recipe that call for Mrs. Dash.  What do they mean "teriyaki sauce"?  If they really mean that , it has sugar or corn syrup in it.  If not, is this meaning soy sauce?  If so, why is it in EVERYTHING???  I love low carb food, but this cookbook did not help me come to that love 
 This is a nice, easy going book.  However the claim which the book makes on the cover that it, "supplants all others, even the immensely successful 'History of Western Philosophy' by Bertrand Russell," is absurd.  Russell has a deep understand of philosophy, Gottlieb does not.  This book is a superficial (but enjoyable) account of philosophy up to the Renaissance.  If you've already read Russell (or have otherwise studied philosophy), this book is of little value.  If you have not, reading Gottlieb might encourage you to read the real thing.  
 Madona is the demonstration of all the things I've learned about the bell curve. When I studied Engineering I learned that accord to "bell curve" the majority of every population is composed of mediocre people. Romans used to say "Give bread and circus to the mediocres, is the only thing they deserve". Madona is the only thing you deserve dumb people. She is mediocre and so you all. If she thinks is necessary to show her naked butt in the middle of 5th avenue to succeed she does. But I'm happy, because the best things is always reserved to superior people, and not to sheeps and mediocres followers like you 
 I'm a fan of Madonna's and I thought "Ray of Light" was great, even though it was  a sound I wasn't used to hearing much from her. So here comes the single "Music," which was funky and futuristic. After listening to the CD I was so ticked off for wasting my money on it. "Music" isn't exciting at all. Too many bleeps, very little emotion, too many bizarre and lousy lyrics. The only good tracks are "Music" and "Runaway Lover". I held on to this CD for as long as I could because it looked good with my Madonna collection. But eventually it started taking up space and I sold it just to make room for my newer CDs.  Get "Ray of Light," "Erotica," "Bedtime Stories," "Like A Prayer," or her self-titled  album. Get any of her earlier music instead of this. You're not missing anything here 
 I think in retrospect I wasted my time on this one. It had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me. As I read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery, I kept on hoping that there would be something more to it, something more enigmatic, a brilliant twist but I was left with despair. My major problem with this novel was there were not enough, in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer. And bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities. I will never touch this author's book again! A mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best-Dan Brown 
 Come on.  I cannot play these dual discs in my car nor any regular CD players. J&MC are excellent though 
 As a Dominican woman I'm completely offended by the title of this book. Also, did the author use MS Word to help translate, why are all the "Spanish" words underlined......two thumbs dow 
 The DVD isn't a good abs workout or a cardio video.  The section on obliques at the end is good but only a few minutes.  The instructor was motivational but I didn't find the moves that creative or intense 
 After quite a while I finally put the time into reading this book and I am totally ambivalent whether I should have or not...I do not think that one should pay too much attention to those readers who do not take their history seriously, to those that want to propound a certain ideological agenda -- something I am realising has been,and is, a depressing fact of American socialisation. Those people of the ideological left will love this book and the those of the ideological right will hate it.... that is a given.   My question is this: What does Zinn have to say for the non-ideological historian? For the thinking and well considered historian, the person who well distilled in classic debates of history and the role of people, power and groups (classes?) in the grand scheme of things? What does Zinn have to say for those who were raised with a university education where the primary goal was to "display an adequate overview of all major acceptable views, and to show a mature understanding of those views?" -- not to argue just one side. American historiography has a broad tendency to degenerate into opposite truth camps of the right and left, mindlessly shouting out statistics, citing dates, supporting and dashing administrations to try to make a point. The entire pursuit of knowledge has been subverted by a kind of default to crude rhetoric for rhetoric's sake (see any American news programme or most prime-time columnists), and purile debate. Other countries and cultures shake their heads at such perversion of the whole idea of the way Americans understand history.    So do historians such as Zinn add to this atrophy of the brain or do they ammeliorate it? I am not so sure I know the answer. I am thinking that his whole style may betray an answer. Zinn's "radical" style is deliberately unbalanced, he makes no apologies for this, it is an attempt to right the largely unbalanced scales of history written by dominant elites, those who have and hold the power. This is a worthy ideal, but I am not so sure that a descriptive litany of abuse by those with power really says that much about an accurate interpretation of history. And if it does not, then what are people actually taking away from this book...?  Anyone who reads history, and I mean people who read a lot of history, will find Zinn to be more than just unbalanced, they will find him to be simplistic. I was caught up in his light drama (he writes well), in the same way as one reads a comic book... and then it dawned upon me... Zinn (like a left-wing version of Fox News reporting) writes as if history were a comic book. All evil on one side and all deprived and down trodden masses on by the other. For the considerate person looking for a higher understanding there will be an amazing sense of dissatisfaction, a feeling of being swindled. If one is trying to achieve social justice, there is a feeling of being swindled.   That may not be flattering for Mr. Zinn, but I got the distinct feeling that one was dealing with a light-weight in the area of history (some of his research is hard to check, he does not cite pages, and I sometimes wonder if he ever cracked an economic history textbook). He certainly would not be considered up there with the grand old man Hobsbawm (who is truly an intellectual joy to read -- and a leftist with common sense!!), or Lukas(another leftist) in his great tour-de-force "Big Trouble: A Study of Class in America." Zinn does not even rate compared with these historians.   So the question I return to is this.... for the considerate person of history, what does one get from this read? My conclusion is that besides some interesting vignettes on American inhumanity to man, or American inhumanity to American -- not much...Even if American history is imbalanced because the "majority" or mainstream history does not pay heed to the downtrodden, meeting diatribe with diatribe is neither a worthy nor reasonable approach -- moreover it is intellectually dishonest. Being biased, for whatever reason, is not something that historians, scientists, or social theoritst should TRY to be...   Historians must try to grasp a modicum of understanding through the haze of sources and alternative viewpoints. They must neither be hoodwinked by the codswallop of postmodernism or the absolute truth "certainty" of various right-wing historians. That is the challenge for the historian -- indeed it is the challenge for any thinking human being. If one wants to write comics that is a worthy endevour -- it is not however history. For a man of his age, he should know better!  *If you are thinking of reading this I would say that his writing style and capturing the drama is rather good, despite the fact that his sources (from the little I was able to check) are horrible.  
    I can't believe this is the path he chose to go ! After putting out such emotional, magnificent work like "Deliverance"? That Cd was true art and craft. The tracks were amazing and they all were cohesive and had a flow to them. Timbaland was a Sick producer and brought out the best in him. Just as he did with Missy Elliot, which her last effort was produced by someone else also. The truth is if you are a timbaland artist there is no where to go but down. Timbaland is a Genious ! This album is very generic and it sounds just like the other 60 million rappers out there. Very contrived AND BASIC in my opinion ! Nothing on here stands out like his other material nothing . Bubba on his preivous two cds had a theme and Tim presented him as a character ! The only thing that has any type of artistry to it on this album is the track "HEY" and it is the last song ? The industry just doesn't appreaciate Timbaland's work and it is sad. Well, I guess I can look forward to Tim's new artist Nelly Furtado ! I hope all the tracks that he hasn't put out over the last year he makes up for it on her album. This is sad, Bubba has more skills and meaning than this. And I don't care what anyone says "Deliverance was a revolution in HipHop compared to most hip albums today! It was just to ahead of the game and people just didn't grasp it. Deliverance was laced with many genres of music. And I think that is why the hop hop community couldn't grasp it. I am a person of diversity I listen to everything from Triphop to Industrial, Rock you name it ! These tracks clearly don't have the work or emotion that went into the last album. Tracks like "NOwhere and Deliverance,Comin round,She tried, overcome ? I will just say this, ChaRM isn't a good album. Acceptable for what the radio wants to play but not good. He may get a little more radio play but I think his sales will even get worse and not from being overlooked and not appreaciated this time. Well, Deliverance will obviously be my last purchase from this artist. I am really sad that we couldn't get another creative gim from bubba but anyway enough said !  A    
 I don't understand the purpose of this book. The six authors all had their story told in Black Hawk Down already. These stories sound like the boring extended scene versions, whereas Bowden only used the highlights of their actions to better convey the intensity of what happened.   Only one author, Dan Schilling, rose above the cliches and bland writing of the others to write a great story. Interestingly, his chapter is the last one in the book as if the editor knew to save the best for last. His story is the only one with depth and feeling.  I respect these guys as soldiers, but as authors they have a long way to go 
 ¿Por qué se le ocurrió a Tim Burton hacer un remake de este clásico? El resultado no puede ser peor... Sólo fui a verla porque sale Tim. Que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo único que vale la pena de toda la historia.  Tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego. ¡Qué no se apague nunca! You Are The Best! 
 If a person's spiritual quest leads them to examine Mormonism, they will need to resolve a key issue very quickly.  That issue is:  do divinely inspired texts on which to base Christian beliefs exist outside the Bible.  If the answer is yes, then a further exploration of Mormonism is possible.  If the answer is no, then Mormonism is a dead end for one's spiritual growth.  That same issue has to be faced when reading A Different Jesus.  While Millet uses many citations from several Christian writers (C.S. Lewis, John F. MacArthur, and Luke Timothy Johnson, among others) and the Bible to bolster his points, the crucial source for most of his arguments are quotes from both Mormonism's sacred texts and subsequent writings by Mormon Prophets and theologians.  If an individual trying to learn about Mormonism doesn't accept the authority of these sources, then Millet's arguments will make no sense.  To be fair, Millet and Mouw state throughout the book that their goal is to provide a basis for understanding, not conversion.  Still, without accepting the central premise that Mormonism's sacred texts are divinely inspired, one will end up understanding how Millet gets to his beliefs without comprehending how he could think such beliefs are true.  A Different Jesus probably would make excellent reading for anyone practicing the Mormon faith, because it does highlight the differences between Mormonism and mainstream Christianity.  Additionally, anyone who is trying to find their spiritual direction will likely find value in parts of the book (particularly, the chapter titled "Recurring Questions").  But, for those who have defined their spirituality within the context of mainstream Christianity, A Different Jesus will not do much to either change their mind about Mormonism's beliefs or improve their comprehension about those beliefs 
 Will someone PLEASE produce a DVD/VHS re-make of DIVA with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film!? I was so excited to finally find this movie, but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans, that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it. I hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they'll re-issue a quality DVD and/or video soon 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 Another compilation of this guy's songs, could life get any sweeter!!? The last true crusader of adult contemporary schlock has bestowed upon us another aural jewel sent straight from the heavens. If you don't own a MB album the you do not know what it is like to live and I am ashamed of you. Get on your knees and pray to this princely man! 
 Sat down and saw this one on televion.  Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money.  What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats.   The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional.   This film Awful. 
 I read this book several years ago.  Just recently, I read Anthony Robbin's Unlimited Power.  If you're choosing between Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited Power, definitely go with Unlimited Power.  Don't bother with this book.   
 I still haven't finished this book.  It's repetitiveness make it hard to pick up for more than a few pages at a time.    Some of the reported facts are quite interesting, but the same scenarios are repeated over and over as "new" evidence of The Problem With Hillary (or HILLARY, if you will).  If the book was a quarter of its actual length it might be a good read.  Also, I still have not figured out why Dick Morris is going after Hillary (other than her obvious character flaws which he does a decent job of revealing in the book).  He stuck by the Clinton's even after being physically assaulted by Bill - so what is the real reason behind his poison pen toward HILLARY.  This isn't his only book about her.  Did something go terribly wrong between he and the former First Family late in their relationship?  Is he just trying to capitalize on his former connections with the Clinton's purely for monetary gain?  Did he like, or at least tolerate, Bill and is now exposing Hillary (and to a lesser exrent Bill) only since that the Clinton presidency is over?  I agree with his apparent opinion of Hillary, but this is just a very poorly organized, overly-repetitive book.  I'd advise checking it out from the library, but it's not worth spending money on 
 I tried to read this trash-book, here in Brazil.Even being an agronomist, I love to read book about religion and history.And this is a trash-book.The core's idea of this trash-book is that, Popes were jew's enemies.   Well, even the most fanatic protestants recognizes, that there was a Pope in Rome, since at least 1,700 years ago.The RCC(Roman Catholic Church) claims that St. Peter was the first Pope in Rome an that he was living there in I Century.After at least 1,700 years, there's thousands of jews, living in Rome today.A comparation between Rome and Afghanistan( a country, bigger than France and England together, not a city) is that while there's thousand of jews in Rome, there was only two jews, in all Afghanistan in 2001.Both old, sick and poor jews.    Reading this book, we will see some "terrible" examples of anti-semithism from some Popes.In other words, because of Popes tragedies, came for all the mankind.This book is 100% biased and leads you, to absurds and bigoted conclusions.    The comparasion between Popes and famous jews, at the same times, shows without a drop of doubt, that famous jews were thousands of times worse than any Pope then living.To example, when Lenin(jew), Trotsky(jew) and a jewish-communist gang, promissed that the whole Chritianity will be soon, wiped out from the world, senteced to death tens of millions of christians in then Soviet Union.What "monster" was Pope living at that time?    Mussolini had enormous money's support from famous and rich jews.Mussolini also got power with a decrete from an excomunicated italian king.Mussolini went to eugenics movement, following bad advices from eugenicists (many of them jews) from Italy and also, from the USA.RCC was the biggest enemy of eugenics.In fact, eugenics was a jewish, protestant, marxist and feminist business.    Hitler himself got enormous amounts of money, from former USSR and famous and rich americans.The vast majority of them, were jews or deeply linked to jews.You can read a book about american money to Hitler, on the Book "Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler".The author of this excellent book is Anthony Sutton and this book is available here, in Amazon.    There's nothing showing any money's supply, from catholic church to Lenin, Mussolini or Hitler.At the same time, every serious historian, knows that famous and rich jews gave enormous amounts of money to all of these murders.    In the last century, while famous jews exterminated more than 40,000,000 faithfull catholics, not a single jew was mudered following Pope's orders.In fact regognizing the Pius XII's support to jews in Rome, the rabin of that city was coverted to the roman catholicism.The real title for this trash-book must be: The Jews Against the Popes.          
 I have read many books by Sharon Sala/Dinah McCall and this one was a major disappointment. The writing was terrible. The clues as to the killer were so obvious, you knew who he was in the first couple of chapters. In addition, the phrase :Oh, My God" and it's variations were used to express every emotion from suprise to disgust to dispair - over and over again. I had to force myself to finish reading it just to see if maybe I had been wrong about how the murderer was. Unfortunately, I wasn't. Sala has written so many good books but if I had read this one first, I would never have bought another one. I'm hoping she didn't really write it - that she used a ghost writer for this one 
 Everyone keeps telling me this is a classic.  I think it's just awful.  It reads like it was written: a rambling, unedited, ill-considered, weakly plotted piece of whimsy jotted down by an ailing old lady... was riding her reputation here - Macabea is just someone who comes and goes.  This novel just isn't finished 
 Terrific as in terrible. The photography was nice. I can handle an odd story line and unconventional ending as long as there is an actual plot -- which this movie lacked. Actually the ending was quite a relief since it did relate to something in the movie. The only 10 minutes that did! Really, if I hadn't paid I would have asked for my money back. And it was only $3.99 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 This book is about as obvious and vague as they come. Nearly ever one of the 101 topics in the book is one of four things: 1) An aspect of starting your own business that is just too obvious to put into a book like this; 2) Someone describes a lesson they learned but gives absolutely NO specifics on exactly what they did that ended up working out for their business; 3) A situation in which a person's (so-called) mistake was the only way they really learned and they worked through it to become successful. The hindsite in these is mearly wishful thinking; or 4) Norman does an absolutely horrid job of explaining what happened or how it supports the title of the lesson. I'll be honest and say that it seems as if Norman wanted to write this "101 things" book so bad, she yanked any possible meaning from a heap of shallow and cliche-filled quotes from business owners.  There ARE a few (and I literally mean 2 or 3) bits of info that you might not think about. But really, if you're serious about starting your own business, you will get nothing from this book 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 Unfortunately the book I ordered turned out to be the American version (light cover) I really wanted the English version (black cover).  The book is known to be a great book, no plaudits required - I just wish it had been made quite clear which version I would receive. (Illustration showed English version). 
 After reading his book NIGHT and being moved by Wiesel's holocaust experiences in the setting of a Nazi Concentration camp, I decided to read TWILIGHT when I saw it sitting next to NIGHT in a bookstore.  TWILIGHT turned out to be a very weird novel whose purpose I never could surmise.  I took it back to the bookstore for a refund.  I highly recommend reading Wiesel's NIGHT, but suggest avoiding TWILIGHT which is bizarre and perplexing 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 I have been considering opening a salon for several years and have now decided to take the next step and actually do it.  I was excited to see this book because it looked like exactly what I needed but overall I was disappointed.  The material in this book is VERY basic.  It would be appropriate for someone with NO knowledge of the beauty industry or business in general.  Anyone who has any industry knowledge or who has done even the most basic research will find nothing new here.  Much of the information is basic business knowledge that I hope most people contemplating opening a business would already have.  There are a few helpful hints but they are buried in the fluff that constitutes the majority of this book - and it isn't even a big book 
 I rarely write reviews, especially for strategy guides, but once I got my hands on Mortal Kombat: Deception's strategy guide, I was spurred on by a suddenly active sense of decency and concern for the well-being of MK fans the world over.  Simply put: do NOT spend $15, or $10, or even tree-fiddy for this guide.  No amount of financial savings will make up for the fact that this guide is useless.  The first thing I realized was that the fatalities were missing for nearly all of the characters.  Only a few random fatalities were shown, I'm guessing because they needed to fill a blank space on a page with a screenshot of some sort.  Same goes for the hara-kiri moves.  Everything was incomplete, except for the voluminous move lists.  Like players would rather have access to all 400 moves for every player, but not the fatalities.  They're called priorities, people!  The Konquest mode walkthrough (or should I say, stumblethrough) is also poorly designed and confusing in its own way.  I found myself wondering where the hell I was and looking for an Outworld gas station.  (At this point, I'm above any potential humiliation from asking directions to a hidden character.)  Lastly, and this may be geek me talking, but the guide was littered with an ungodly amount of grammatical and spelling errors on every page.  A couple of random ones I can understand, but honestly, I think this was either poorly translated from another language, or the editing department wasn't paid enough to care if it looked any good.  So long story short, get the moves/fatalities/hara-kiris/whatever from a reputable gaming site.  You'll save money, and you'll get what you were looking for 
 I was disapointed by this book. The author ideas are very intersting and deserve 5 stars. However, every chapter starts with very few pages of text then continues with a copy/past of NTSB reports. The book has about 500 pages more than 400 arn't original work but just publicly available accident reports 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 The curiously gifted songwriter Stephin Merritt is best known as the guiding force behind several acclaimed indie-pop groups -- most notably The Magnetic Fields, who amazed, delighted, and sort of overwhelmed us all with the three CD collection 69 Love Songs (and then followed up with the underwhelming album i.) Over the past few years, Mr. Merritt has also written songs for three music theater productions by Chen Shi-Zheng, and Showtunes is jam-packed with 26 of them.  These tunes encompass everything you love (or perhaps don't?) about Stephin's songwriting -- they are clever and witty, compact and concise, tuneful and cloying... and a bit precious at times. There's one major problem however -- Stephin isn't singing any of them.  Instead, the Showtunes are (appropriately, I guess) performed by vocalists and choruses from "the original casts" in a mannered, over-enunciated, Broadway-esque style that sounds more like Gilbert & Sullivan than The Magnetic Fields. And sadly, I couldn't stand it.  Maybe listeners more enamored of musical theater than I am would not be as distracted by this (I can't stomach Cole Porter songs sung this way either.) Besides, the arrangements are fantastic, using unconventional ensembles that convincingly blend Asian instruments with lute, autoharp, accordian, marimba, and steel drums -- thankfully without the electronic clutter that sometimes intrudes upon Magnetic Fields productions. (Happily, a few instrumental selections are sprinkled throughout the CD.)  But unfortunately, all I could think about while listening to Showtunes was how much better these songs would sound if they were sung by Merritt's soulful, resonant, unpretentious baritone voice instead. And I suspect that many of his other fans will feel the same way, hoping as I do that Stephin has worked through this musical theater phase once and for all.  In the future, if he combines the formidable songwriting and orchestration skills heard on Showtunes with the sincere and direct vocal performances that graced so many of the 69 Love Songs, I expect to be amazed and delighted by Stehpin Merritt again and again.  Meanwhile, be forewarned: The Magnetic Fields meets The Mikado may not be your cup of Oolong tea 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 Men and women have equal sex drives,deal with it!What makes us  different is the constant shaming women get when they do indeed act sexual.If you have the word "slut" hanging over your head constantly it just might make you want to cling to romance in order to appear less sexual than a man.Gray generalizes,and not only generalizes but makes women out to be sexless objects there to please men and not themselves. He writes as though he has a great fear of men and women being  equal in sex drive.His mysogamist views of women are  disgusting! In short what he says is,the woman only has to look nice for the man,and the man has to romance,begg and trick women into  bed because women in his mind really don't want or need sex. 
 One minor problem for me, that is evidently not a problem for many others, was the art.  I was put off by the blotchy, surrealistic, color-schemes, which were distracting, and rarely added to whatever charm the line-drawings themselves possessed.  Getting past that, I was able to enjoy the silly story.  Humor is often generated when the tension is created by horror or fear, but then is punctured by the absurdity of the situation.    All decent people should be horrified by the idea of buying and selling other human beings, in pursuit of materialistic goals, as though they were mere objects.  Here, however, the absurdity of the situation breaks the ice.  We know that virtually no real child would want to sell his or her father.  Moreover, the idea of this rather useless dad permitting himself to be bartered all over town by children, without ever once looking up from his newspaper, is completely nonsensical.  I suppose children might laugh (just as I did).  Another saving grace is that, even though the story is told from the point of view of the creepy little sociopath of a son who sells his dad, there were other characters for me to root for.  I was completely on the side of the little sister, who (quite properly) objects and protests the scheme.  She (quite properly) rats him out to his mother, who is also suitably furious, and makes this creepy little materialist promise never to sell his dad again.  Morever, since the bulk of the story concerns the quest to RECOVER the bartered-off dad, even the boy is doing the right thing for much of the narrative.     But then comes the TWIST.  You see, he never promised anything about not selling his little sister.  The last panel shows the brother's huge shadow, mouth open with glee, reaching like an ogre for this little girl, who looks small, isolated, helpless.    This time, I did not laugh.  Why not?  This time, sadly, the absurdity of the situation does not puncture the horror.  It is not absurd enough, and it is too horrific.  We do not think the boy is joking.  Earlier in the tale, we actually saw the little sister bound and gagged by the older brother to prevent her ratting on him to Mom (a disturbing enough scene in its own right).  Moreover the pictures make the boy look much larger and stronger than his little sister --  the situation lacks the obvious jokiness of bartering off one's much-larger dad while he never looks up from his newspaper.  Even the THREAT of selling your little sister to your friends is potentially a nasty and frightening form of abuse.      Gaiman's afterword tells us the story reflects real and bitter hostility that existed between two of his children, and further reflected a similar bitter hostility between himself and his own sister.  This eerily suggests that the final panel might have been inspired by genuine malice.  How, then is it a joke?  If bitter hostility between siblings is a problem -- and it often is -- ought not the message, in a picture book ostensibly marketed for children, be a bit more positive?  Payback time, little girl!  I guess she shouldn't have ratted out her creepy older brother.  Funny to Gaiman, perhaps, but not to me 
 David Fromkin's "Peace to End All Peace" is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. Many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other.  Fromkin attempts to examine how the modern Middle East (extending as far as Afghanistan and some sections of Central Asia) was created during and after the First World War. Obviously, in order to do this, the fall of the Ottoman Empire in that war must be considered. This is where Fromkin's unusual methodology comes into play. Focusing on the European political machinations to resolve the "Eastern Question" in their favour, the sorry tale becomes one more of Churchill and TE Lawrence than of the Arabs and Turks who were also involved in the process. Admittedly, it was the Europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn, but reducing key figures such as the CUP Triumvirate in the dying Ottoman Empire (and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much.  Never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell. A complex web of national and personal political interests in both Europe and the Middle East combined to make the region what it is today, and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations. The problem that Fromkin has, however, is that he does not make these very well at all. The story is told in a roughly chronological manner, which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters. Ultimately, the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader, who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is.  Additionally, Fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided. Indeed, one map (showing Enver Pasha's advance on Baku and his campaigns in Central Asia) is laughable in the extreme. The legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows, and not equilateral triagles.  Where Fromkin does well, however, is in his use of purely European sources. It is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern Middle East, but I have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the Middle Eastern aspects of the events in question. In terms of Europe, however, his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did.  Ultimately, "A Peace to End All Peace" is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work. A diplomatic history of Europe during the Great War can be written much better than this, and a history of the development of the Middle East following that conflict already has been (the chapters in Margaret Attwood's "The Peacemakers" or William Cleveland's "Modern Middle East" both easily outshine this) 
 Whilst Alexander story is certainly impressive, this book is certainly far below my expectations.  It lacks style,  good dialogues,  an intelligent subplot (his life was interesting enough not to make the novel a bore) a  good description of the other protagonists.  One thing is certain: a good  (and expensive) marketing campaign (such as the ones that Stephen King has)  can sell a lot of books, and make its author famous,  but will not  transform him into a good on 
 This book was horrible, one: because these books don't interest me at all, and two: why does there have to be a whole novel on this topic when there cold just be a summary sheet. Basically this book is just not my cup of TEA..hahh 
 This story was very boring.  JK still writes much, much better than the many hack bestseller authors out there, but, considering his capabilities, this book was disappointing to me.  See his first eight or ten or so novels which, in my opinion, were infinitely more colorful, riveting, and original, and show the excellent work of which this author is capable 
 While this book is nicely photographed, well-organized and easy to follow, the focus is very controlled arrangements. Because I prefer the more natural, "just picked from my garden" look, this book did not  appeal to me 
 This was the first go board I ever had, about ten years ago (looks like it's still the same as it was then).  The game of go itself is wonderful, and everyone should learn and teach all their friends.  This equipment, though, is of poor quality and overpriced in relation to that lack of quality.  The board itself is a cheap wood laminate -- I carried mine around in a backpack a few times, and the corners started coming apart.  It's basically plywood, and won't survive ungentle use like a solid piece of wood will.  The stones are cheap plastic things, whereas a basic set of good ceramic/glass stones are not that expensive.  Lastly and most importantly, this go set is *tiny*!  While that does make it more compact, it's very hard to manipulate.  Fingers constantly bump the (very lightweight) stones by accident, it's hard to avoid messing up the board layout, and the whole "feel" of the game is lost 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 If you want to checkout a good Jason Scott Lee film, I recommend the following:  Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story  Rapa Nui  "Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision" is an awful film. Awful production values. Awful acting. Awful script. I would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances Asian American awareness in Hollywood (This film does neither.).  I would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing. If you are curious, perhaps a rental from Netflix, but this film is definitely not for keeps.  If you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your Asian American film awareness, and came away disappointed, then I recommend the following films for your personal viewing. These are well-written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of Asian American actors:  Better Luck Tomorrow   Mulan   
 It has been 15 years since I last shopped for a stereo receiver, and back then there were certain features that all receivers came with, regardless of how basic or inexpensive the model was.  Well, I took for granted that they all still came with these basic features, and I was wrong.  I just purchased the Sherwood RX-4105, and it does not have the tape monitoring feature.  It has tape input and output jacks, but it doesn't have the monitoring feature that lets you listen to the tape deck's output while you are recording.  If you press the tape button, the receiver switches away from the input source you are trying to record from!  The tape monitor function is also necessary for the use of an equalizer.  It baffles me that they are still giving you tape in and out jacks, but don't give you the proper switching for monitoring.  I guess they figured they could save a few pennies by leaving out this function, since the demand for tape decks has declined in recent years.  Unfortunately, there are those of us who still like to use an EQ to customize the sound to our environment, even if we are no longer recording on tape.  I have found it difficult to verify whether or not a receiver has this function, since the specs and features list usually never mentions it.  If they have a good picture of the unit, you can look to see if there is a button that says "tape monitor."  Just looking for tape in and out jacks will not help, because as I mentioned above, the RX-4105 has these jacks, but no monitor function.  Then there are some models that have monitoring even though the switch only says "tape."  The best way to know for sure is to try out the unit first, but this is not practical when shopping online.  I have even gone so far as to go to the manufacturer's website and download the instruction manual.  If the section on tape connections and recording doesn't mention "monitoring," it probably doesn't have it.  Also, many models no longer have phono input, but this is easy to check just by looking at a good picture of the unit.  The RX-4105 also lacks an auxillary AC jack on the back of the unit; not a big deal, but a consideration if you have an outlet strip already filled up by other components. Another thing I noted that is worth mentioning is that many newer models such as this one have volume control knobs that do not have any position indicators or scale markings on them; so be sure to turn down the volume before you turn off the unit, or you could be in for a surprise when you turn it back on again!  If you don't intend to use an EQ, and don't need phono input, the RX-4105 is probably a good inexpensive starter model.  The sound seemed fine, and it had plenty of power for my application.  The tuner did seem to have a weak sensitivity; some local FM stations came in with a lot of static.    In my research I have found the TEAC models RV-S2100 and AG-790, as well as Onkyo models TX-8011 and TX-8211 all have tape monitoring capabilities as well as phono input. 
 I'll be the first to admit that the Carlyle Group seems to "work" the system...perhaps even abuse it to profit from their "connections" to goverment.  And yes, they've done a few thing most people would find to be inappropriate.  However the author's case would have been much more compelling had he simply stated the facts and not editorialized so much.  The result makes you feel like it's a crackpot conspiracy theory.  His liberal use of adjectives and obvious melodrama to make us think something horribly sinister is afoot made me bitter toward journalists, rather than his intended target, the Carlyle Group.   Typical of the news media today: he couldn't just report the facts...he had to color it with his political (or paranoid) biases 
 this is a great book...if you 15 and you've finaly run out of ravenwolf books to read ...otherwise...save your money.  While some of his visualization excersises are interesting, its pretty obvious, even before you read the rest of his books, that he's building up to admiting he's not a wiccan or even pagan, he's heading for satanist...or a drug treatment center, whichever comes first. And I have no problem with that, but lets call this what it is...pandering to disafected teenagers, angsty 20 somethings and bitter 30's. If you need something to put on your coffee table to annoy visiting Jehovah's witneses or to scare your parents...this is the author and these are the books, but if your looking for useful information.. its not in here 
 I could not make my computer recognize it so therefore it is useless to me 
 Well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly, but if you're expecting to understand what the words actually mean...I wouldn't recommend this. I was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but I have no idea what any words in the sentence/caption actually mean.   I've used it for a month know and I have no greater knowledge of Chinese than when I started....  
 This telplay is supposedly based on the possibility of an asteroid hitting the earth. That possibility is real, and many people take the issue seriously. One commercial film, Deep Impact, also included some real effort to "get it right". However, there is nothing in this film that relates to the real concern about asteroid impacts. This is pure fantasy and thus a turn-off to anyone who has thought seriously about this issue 
 ***This is a discussion about certain points in the book, and may be considered to some a spoiler, so please do not read if you want to remain surprised about the book's high points and/or outcome.***  I expected to read this book and feel inspired by the obstacles that were overcome by Chris Gardner as he rose from a poverty-stricken child living the hard knock life to a successful adult with many moral achievements. However, this was not the case. Shortly into the book, I came to realize that most of Mr. Gardner's problems were self-created. Sure, his upbringing was a contributory factor to some of his issues. But mostly, he made some very bad choices that resulted in some very bad outcomes.  First, I disliked how he constantly put his mother, the woman who allowed herself and her children to be beaten time and time again by her husband, on a pedastool. This was a woman who went to prison twice, once for welfare fraud and once for attempted murder, yet we are to believe she was the epitomy of moral conscience? In all fairness, it is respectable that Mr. Gardner continued to idolize his mother, even after his rough childhood and the abuse to which he was subjected at home. However, this woman exemplified so many reasons why she was the complete opposite of an ideal role model for a child.  Second, I thought it extremely irresponsible of Mr. Gardner to discuss not being able to afford to put food on the table for his wife and child some days, and in the next sentence to talk about getting high with his buddies to "take the edge off". Certainly the drugs were not always free. Was he spending the family's grocery money on drugs?   Third, I disliked how he rationalized listening to jokes containing the infamous "N" word from the rich oil tycoon, simply because this same man was fattening his pockets at the time. This tells the world that such a situation is acceptable, so long as someone benefits enough to overlook the insulting word. I also found it absolutely disgusting how Mr. Gardner, immediately upon hearing of this oil tycoon's death, sold every bit of stock in the man's portolio, even though he himself admitted that all stock sales should immediately halt once an estate is in probate. Mr. Gardner stated that the oil tycoon, in the days before his death, had requested that all of his portfolio assets be liquidated (never mind the history of 30-35% capital gains), and that Mr. Gardner was only carrying out his final "orders". I call Mr. Gardner's bluff on this one - he sold that stock just to make a final commission. Mr. Gardner showed a true lack of ethics in this situation.  Finally, and most disturbing, was how Mr. Gardner sent his son to live with Jackie after she had already once abandoned the child. She had proven herself once to be an unfit mother, yet Mr. Gardner sent his son across the country to live with her after he starting achieving personal financial success in Chicago. If his main concern was the welfare of his child, why did he not keep little Chris with him?  Overall, I am completely dissapointed with this book. Mr. Gardner may be hailed as a hero to some, but he is most certainly not a hero to me.     
 This book is not what I expected.  It's more of a "workbook" instead of a book to read.  I was thoroughly disappointed 
 This book starts with an outright lie: George of Capadocia was murdered by a PAGAN mob. As bishop of Alexandria, he had done more to piss off pagans than anybody in the history of the Roman Empire. It was only after Julian had come out of the pagan closet that they felt safe enough to act against George. Athanasius' followers played a minimal part, if any, in that incident.   No contemporary sources attest to the manner of Arius' death. This supposedly was a story circulated by Athanasius decades after the fact, and then retold a few more decades later by historian Socrates. Anybody familiar with the depiction of Judas' death in the Book of Acts can see what Athanasius was getting at: Arius was another Judas. At the time of his death, Arius had long ceased being a player in church politics and his reinstatement was an act of charity to a forgotten old man, not a triumphant vindication. There was nothing to be gained by murdering him.   The author states that if a Council ever deserved to be called ecumenical it was that of Rimini-Seleucia. Hardly. If there was ever a Council that was rigged to produced a desired result (beginning with the idea of dividing it into two venues to better isolate Athanasius' followers), it was that of Rimini-Seleucia.  And so on. In this book so many creative liberties have been taken with the facts that it becomes impossible to tell what is conjecture and what is historical. Not to mention the absurd conflation of Adoptionist and Gnostic ideas being presented as Arianism by the author.  Other reviewers have pointed out the author is not a theologian or historian. Indeed, it is worse than that: he is a LAWYER. Lawyers are not trained to get at the truth. Lawyers are trained to win their cases by any "legal" means necessary. For whatever reason, the author seems to be out to destroy the reputation of the Christian witnesses and to discredit their testimony. You would never guess from this book that the Church during this period did a single positive thing.  Moreover, I think there is something disturbingly inappropriate about the publication of a book written by a person of a religious background which derisively speculates about another religion's origins. In the century before and the century after the birth of Jesus, Judaism was a battleground between different factions at least as brutal as the Christianity depicted by this author, if not worse. If I, a Christian, were to publish a book which speculated about the legitimacy of the Judaism which emerged from that struggle, I hope I would get severely criticized, to say the least. Maybe that's the book Mr. Rubinstein should have written instead.  I give this book one star to counter the high reviews it's been getting from readers who take it at face value as a source of Church history. The best advice to readers is to approach this book as one would the Da Vinci Code: a historical kernel lies somewhere within a liberally and creatively elaborated story. But if you want a real Church history which is well-balanced and easy to read, I recommend picking up Chadwick's "The Early Church" instead 
 A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.  
 This book does not offer much more than the Sun J2EE Tutorial online does and that is free. I have worked through the first two weeks, and I have decided to shelve it. The book starts strong with the JNDI. There are plenty of code listings for you to type in and try with good explanations on naming, binding, and lookup. After this the book is nothing more than a rehash of the Sun Online tutorial with a different larger example application. The application is complete. You don't do anything but read about the design and pertinent Java technologies that are being used for that particular part of the application. Then you are given instructions on how to deploy the current working piece of the application on the J2EE RI, and run sample clients against it - chapter after chapter of the same thing. Though this type of learning by reading some one else code with explanations seems to be enjoyed by some. I side with Ivor Horton. Programming is not a spectator sport. You learn by doing. Having the reader build the application and participate in the process would have made for a better learning experience of a complex topic 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Acting: forget it. Story: Ludacrous. However the production design (sets, the puppet, killer mechanisms) and the cinematography are worth mentioning - although I can tell you now that the stylish overall look of this film will seem awfully dated in a dozen of years.  I'm giving this film 2 stars: one for the efforts of the production design team, the other one is to be shared by the marketing heads of the studio, the editor who cut one hell of a good trailer together and the graphic designer(s) who are responsible for the layouts of all promo material.  
 Here are some interesting facts relating to "Heat" and myself:  LENGTH OF FILM:  547 Minutes NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN FILM:  231 NUMBER OF INTERESTING OCCURRENCES: 0 NUMBER OF MINUTES I WAS INVOLVED/ENTERTAINED BY THIS FILM: 0 NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE STARTED WATCHING THIS FILM, THEN STOPPED: 5-6   Truth be told, I've never actually watched "Heat" in its entirety.  I've seen almost all of it, and many parts of it multiple times, but never all the way through.  (In fact, I think I probably have seen absolutely all of it, considering how many scenes I distinctly recall seeing repeatedly, but I can't be sure.)  Anyway, I'll be sitting there trying to watch it and I just can't do it.  It's so damn boring, and the thought of me being this bored for the next 8 hours is just too much and I have to do something else.  Like randomly flip through the channels for the next couple hours.  Maybe just stare at the walls and think.  Mow the lawn, perhaps .  Do some dishes. Clip my toe nails. Anything.  (I hasten to add, however, that its extreme length isn't really "Heat"s problem.  It's all boring.  Cut it down to 100 minutes and it would still be really boring, just not for as long.  Which would make it about twice as good, actually, but we're talking about such a small baseline that the difference wouldn't be terribly perceptible.)  And it's not like this thing isn't up my alley.  People I trust and who have good taste tell me it's good and  I like crime-dramas.  It has a generally excellent cast. But then I'll be looking at the screen and not one thing, not one thing will happen that makes me want to keep looking at it.  And so I stop.  I'd like to be more specific, but it's pretty damn hard to say why a film isn't involving.  It's tough to describe a lack.  Probably it has something to do with the film having so much going on that it doesn't really have time to get into anything.  I especially like how Pacino's stepdaughter tries to off herself, yet we've only seen her on screen for like 2 minutes.  Why would I care? Pacino's marriage is failing, you say?  Why would I care? Pacino and De Niro have tedious conversations with one another.  Oh boy.  It's also hurt by their making Pacino a cop.  He doesn't much work as a good guy.  Furthermore, the action scenes are dull as hell.  Also, one of the major themes of the film is about how cop and robber are two sides of the same coin.  For other examples of this see every other cop drama ever made, particularly the ones that suck.  (This observation, by the way, comes from the film "Adaptation", and though it didn't specifically refer to "Heat" it totally applies.  On a related note, "The 3" would be about 1000 times more entertaining than "Heat", were someone to make it.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, be sure to check out "Adaptation".  It's a good example of a film that ISN'T really sucky and boring.)     Unlike some things I dislike I feel no animosity towards those who think "Heat" is great, though I can't help but suspect that many of them were expecting a great movie, and so they got one at least in their heads.  It's got Pacino and De Niro together!  It's so damned long, complicated, self-important and humorless!  It superficially resembles great films from the past!  4 stars!!  I realize that this is unfair of me and I hate it when other people try and explain the hidden, false meanings why I like whatever movie they don't like, but it's what I think, and if that makes me a hypocrite, which it does, well, I can't change that.  And besides, it's always possible that I'm right....  If in 20 years "Heat" is largely forgotten we can assume that I'm correct.  If not I'll watch it again, this time all the way through, and we'll see if I've changed my mind, and we'll finally know if everyone else was deluded or if I'm just a stupid freak who differed from most of the other wise viewers on this one.  Get back to me in 2026.  Perhaps we'll have to make it 2031, cause the idea of me watching any of this movie again within the next 2 decades makes me a bit antsy.  I need some more breathing room.  But til then, the hell with "Heat".  I'll just watch "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas" or "The Departed" or whatever again.  Just about anything will do, actually, regardless of quality or genre as long as it's shorter than "Heat".    
 A movie that could not get theatrical release, in which a right wing radio phoney attempts to argue with statements made in another movie. The guy needs to try honest labor. His fans need to get hobbies or something. 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 I have just finished reading Ender's Shadow, the first of the Bean quartet novels and I enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed the original book. There's something about the way Card presents characters that captures you into reading the book non-stop. So you can imagine my disappointment when I started reading Xenocide.  Judging from the other reviews, I realized that Xenocide is a kind of a book that you either love as you loved Ender's Game (and everyone loves that one) or hate it because of the way it progresses, portrays characters and overall plot involved.  Frankly, I think I'm in the later category. I was so tired of reading this book that I couldn't force myself to finish it.  Not only the characters were completely unbelieavable, but I thought trying to mix cultures and jump from one to another every chapter was quite pointless. I admit, it was daring on Card's part to try to attempt it, but he just couldn't handle it, I think. The same way as he couldn't handle brining too much fiction into sci-fi realm. Some of the plot twists were completely outrageous even for sci-fi standards. And mixing so many philosophical topics in under-300 pages book is simply wrong. You can't expect to try to find a solution to life, death, soul, humanity and everythign else he tried to mention using nothing but a bunch of unbeliavable 'wanna-be' genius characters. And to add to all this disappointment is the sheer normality of Ender Wiggin. It's as if he's in this book just to remind us that it's part of the series. He really was not needed in this novel at all.   In conclusion, I thought the book lacked progression, pace, presentation and believable characters. Overall, it was a pretty poor novel, but I guess every writer gets one of those once in a while (some more so than others).  It's worth reading, but don't feel like you're betraying the series if you suddenly have an urge to throw the book away. it just happens to be poorly written. 
 The book should be "commentary about every song" rather than "stories behind every song". The only thing worse than the "stories" behind the songs is the fact that most of the pictures have the wrong attribution (they keep referring to Cliff Martinez as Jack Irons, and one picture says "Founders - Kiedis, Flea, Slovak, Irons" yet clearly has Chad Smith and Frusciante). The only thing good about this book are the handful of great pictures 
 yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
 AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.  	If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)"  Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)"   	At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design."  He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.  	Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane 
 This came out when I was 12: it would have been far too 'difficult' an album for a young whippersnapper and I was only vaguely aware that the Bunnymen existed at that time. In my early teens I bought a few Bunnymen singles and Ocean Rain; now, 24 years later, I'm trying to fill in the rest of the Bunnymen jigsaw.   After a week of repeated listening, I'd say you can try on this album in either of two ways. Either, you judge it by its stand out songs, which are far and few between: if you can listen half a dozen times and manage to hum more than 2 tunes afterwards, you're doing better than me.   Alternatively, you can put it in context: appreciate that this was a pretty original approach at the time and marvel at the uncanny proto-U2 sound, (which I have to say does precious little to endear it to me). If you're interested in exploring music history largely for its own sake, it's worth hearing in order to understand how we got from Joy Division to U2 within a couple of years. However, if like me you think both Joy Division and U2 are vastly overated, this really isn't going to do much for you.   It's determindly bleak, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but this also captures the Bunnymen at a stage before they got a knack for melody: only 'Over the Wall' and 'A Promise' deliver a decent hook. I've seen Heaven Up Here described as a work of 'rare beauty'. It can also cause a tense, nervous headache.  If you're interested in the early 80's British underground scene, then of course you should hear it, along with the other Bunnymen albums. Compared to the lush Scott Walker-esque Ocean Rain, though, this is half-baked and less than half-rewarding. 
 Threads of Life is really disappointing. Shadows Fall once showed great promise. What happened? We get the same guitar riffs, same song set up and same bad vocals. Brian Fair has to be one of the worst and most predictable singers out there. Anyone who has seen them live (like me) can tell you that. Guitar work is good but we've all heard this before. Nothing new or innovative. Some solid but predicatable drum work. Do they have a bass player? Metalcore is on its way out.  Stick with "Art of Balance" or "The War Within". Or save your money and buy the new CD from Machine Head or Dark Tranquility. 
 What happened with this band? The fifth and last song are technoish songs that sound horrible. And the rest of the CD is just, I don't know, not that good. I mean, the CD as a whole isn't crap, but they've just lost their touch. I like the piano the fact that the piano is emphasized in this CD(like the second song is cool) but the guitars seemed to take a big drop. They just don't have, as I said before that touch. I mean, I really tried to like this album, but I jsut couldn't. I totally recomend their first album, Crashings 
 I found VERY little useful information in this book...not because it isn't there but because the writing style is too "out there".  I'm sorry I bought it 
 Let me begin by saying that I love the Firm. I've been using their workouts since 1992 and the old Firm tapes by the Bensons (pre-1999)truly are the best on the market. The book, however, leaves much to be desired.  While the chapter on nutrition is somewhat helpful and interesting, the rest of the book is a total disappointment. As many other reviewers have said, the Bensons are SHAMELESS in their bashing of other fitness instructors. They are even quite mean about it, which flies in the face of the later chapters on manners and politeness. (The reference to celebrity instructors was particularly rich, since their second tape featured Janet Jones Gretzky. There is no mention of her, nor the other 'actress/dancer' leads from the classic tapes.) You have a great product, ladies! There is no need to be bitter and defensive.  Much of the extraneous, out-of-place information on grooming, dress and reading material seemed trite and silly in a book, not to mention constricting. It's ok to  leave the house with a few grey hairs and without manicured nails! Not all of us want to look like Barbie. Their attitude seems to be, 'this is how we are, thus all of you should be like us,' right down to their particular interest in Ancient Greece. Perhaps the Bensons would have been better served by skipping the book and starting up a magazine. A lot of this material would have been better presented in that type of forum. I am sure many dedicated Firm Believers would have subscribed willingly.  The Bensons sold the Firm a few years ago and the new workouts are a SAD follow-up to the great ones of the past. The new Firm is now glutting the market with cheap, plastic 'must-have' gizmos, while Anna Benson is making new, interesting workouts under the name 'Fitprime'. This book is the only blight on what has been a great contribution by the Bensons 
 Well, I sure could have skipped this one.  I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me.  Mostly, I was just plain bored.  There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks.  Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President.  And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie.  But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter.  
 Intensely homophobic, heterosexist, and hateful, this film represents the twisted fears and logic of the early panic stage of the disease in the 1980s. It was a time when the public was eager to pin the epidemic squarely on the shoulders of gay men, blaming antisocial "AIDS carriers" for carelessly or intentionally infecting chaste wives and innocent babies. It was a time when the public blamed AIDS on lust-driven, irresponsible gay men and cheating husbands. The film is pretentious and overbearing in its failed attempt to masquerade as a sophisticated inquiry into moral responsibility in the age of HIV. It reinforces the simplistic outdated idea that those who are infected with HIV can be neatly separated into the categories of "deserving" or "undeserving" - immoral monsters and their innocent victims sitting together on death row. Twenty years ago, perhaps this film would have its place as a document reflecting our social ignorance and failures in coping with a new epidemic. We did not know then that HIV was a predominantly heterosexual global pandemic. Today this film is a sophomoric attempt to assign blame and reinforce old prejudices about HIV and HIV+ people. Most importantly, HIV is no longer a death sentence to Americans who discover their status and enter medical treatment early. As someone who counsels and tests hundreds of people for HIV infection every year, I would not recommend this film to anyone seeking knowledge or entertainment 
 I bought two Bionicles for my son's stocking at Christmas.  He is 5 so I had to help him put them together.  It took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it, it began to fall apart.  The instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks.  If your child just wants to construct them and display them, then this is great.  If your child wants to play with them, forget it.  Go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life 
 How to get the most money for your property. This topic, worthy of a book, gets a couple of pages which are platitudes. This is the second book of his I've read recently in which he talks about determining the market price. The approach he advocates will result in a variance with the market of 40%, if not more. And, he lumps apartment buildings in with houses as if they were valued the same way. Of course, they are not.  On the plus side, in this book he recognizes that people do tend to get legal advice before signing a contract. He tells you how to diffuse the lawyer's criticism before it happens.  During my years as an apartment broker, I dealt with more than a few lawyers, including clients. Maybe his approach will work, but I'd think not.  This is another feel-good, cheerleading book. Rich Dad, Poor Dad does a better job of cheerleading, but has even less substance than this lightweight work.   Once again, the author has silly sales techniques that don't work. Once again, let me point you to the best writer in sales: Neil Rackham.   Spare yourself time, money and effort. Pass on everything David Finkel writes or promotes (as I shall hereafter) 
 This is the same review I posted for Green Mars. Also applies to Blue Mars. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.  I love epics, so I plodded through this trilogy, hoping it would get better, but it never did. I could sense that Robinson was extremely proud of the detailed world he created, but the story is horrible. The story unfolds glacially, with no sense of movement. Just when you think you might be getting attached to a character, he/she dies. Interesting story lines get dropped. There are long, long stretches where Robinson just describes everyday life, in excruciating, boring detail. There is no excitement or suspense, no character that grabs you. It's like some dull person's real life, full of routine, disappointment, and boredom. Robinson's typical character has a dream, begins to pursue it, getting you inspired, then gets killed or just gives up and joins the cause he was fighting.  This was the worst science fiction I have ever read. I can't believe I read all three books 
 Stephen Kern read a lot, writing his book. His study is a conglomerate of the most important authors, sociologists and philosophers focusing on the shift of time and space concepts in modern Europe. The broadness of his knowledge is the lack of his book, because it is nothing else than a masterwork of the superficial. Combine a little bit of time-philosophy in the novels of Proust, a little bit of brainstorming (Molly Bloom) in Joyce, combined with Einstein, James, Husserl (!), Bergson, Ibsen, etc. and you have a good pseudo-cultural-philosophic consomm. The book is mixture of articles you find in encyclopedias. I am very disappointed, especially with Harvard University Press.  
 what were they trying to teach me?   this book is intermittently funny, more often highly and dryly pretentious and snobbish, but more than anytyhing I find it very very creepy. Towards the end when things start to fall apart for Aimee, Dennis/Waugh achieves a combination of callousness and feeble wit that is so offputting to the sensitive reader, I can hardly believe the book made it to press without a major rewrite of the last few chapters. It would be one thing if it were much much funnier, but most of the "comedy" is of the "lost in translation" variety: nothing but xenophobia and looking down on those beings from a different culture and therefore certainly inferior that populate certain parts of the globe. haha those silly japanese persist in speaking their own language/americans women are all completely interchangable unlike our English roses! Didn't this guy also write "Brokeback Revisited" anyway?  I was totally embarrrased to be seen reading it in public when I took it to dinner with me one night at the little thai place!  the movie is interesting cause john waters certainly got the idea of edie the egg lady from this film (and not from the book. mom is quite different onscreen as conceived by terry southern and c. isherwood.( also liberace is fun, rod steiger is A M A Z I N G.                            
 I was disappointed in this book.  I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to.  I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things.  Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well.  The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story.  There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line.  I felt very let down at the end of this audio book 
 I would like to buy one this book of Moo, Douglas, the Epitles to the Romans.  Grand Rapids: Eardmans, 1996. 1012pp 
 Rory is a high-school student and a talented artist.  The artistic part isn't surprising--her father is a painter and has been teaching Rory how to draw and paint since she was a very small child.  Her happiest memories involve her father and art.  So it is especially devastating when Rory finds her father kissing another woman.  When he leaves her and her mother, Rory feels like it is her fault for confronting him and being so angry.  With her father gone, Rory loses her ability to draw or paint.  She tries to remember the things he taught her, but she can't hear his voice any longer.  It seems she may never regain her artistic abilities, unless her father agrees to come home again.  This story has a good premise, but I felt like it was too short to really address how Rory would be okay again.  Being able to talk to her father would certainly help, but I think she would also have to focus on her relationship with her mother.  Both of them were broken after her father left, and in order to get their lives back they would have to learn to rely on each other more.  Nothing in this story dealt with that relationship.  Instead, the author made it seem like Rory would be fine as long as she had her father's support, regardless of her mother's state of mind.  
 I was shocked by the poor quality of the writing from such a well-known author.  Though published in 1995, the reader is expected to ignore the then-well-known realities of DNA testing -- for instance, that shared parentage can be proved by comparing the DNA of siblings, not just from putative sibling to parent.  We're also asked to ignore the realities of fingerprint identification when it would have been immediately helpful in revealing an imposter's criminal record and actual identity.    Adding insult to injury, after ignoring the technique when it logically would have come into play, Sheldon brings in fingerprinting at the very tail of the book, in a complicated scenario involving latent prints to identify not the missing heiress, but rather, a private detective!    Every plot development was telegraphed in advance, and the decedent went from being rather interesting in the first few pages to a one-dimensional (and repetitive) demon throughout the rest of the too-long tome.  Even the vocabulary and sentence structure were overly simplistic.  If you want to read the identical plot but done WELL, try "Amanda" by Kay Hooper, also published in 1995.  Hooper has her character do some marvelously stupid things (again, failing to exploit DNA to the fullest in a timely way), but Hooper's vocabulary, syntax, character development and settings are vastly better than the careless work Sheldon provides in "Morning, Noon, & Night."  I read the books only a week apart.  Hooper's work was engaging, though somewhat predictable; Sheldon's was irritating, and ENTIRELY predictable. 
 Despite many reviews recommendation this book for beginners, it has nothing for the beginners. It is clearly for people who have prior knowledge. Does not explain any basics.   Do not install CD. Despite my mentioning a particular folder in which to install the software, the CD went ahead and created a new folder called PROGRAM. And this conflicted with the WIndows startup at next boot - which gave me a message that this folder has to be renamed to anything but PROGRAM.   In any case, the software did not run.  But a big disappointment, when I went by the reviews 
 Note that this product includes only the AC adapter but no additonal cabling to attach to the Zune.  So if you were thinking about having one cable to hook to your PC and another to charge if you are away from you PC, remember to take the Zune cable with you. For $29.95 I expected them to include the 25 cent cable 
 This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's a title to read if you wish to be considered "well read." Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird." 
 This book has won the Hugo award and may have had a tremendous impact when it first came out, unfortunately it is now greatly outdated.  While some books hold up better over the course of time, this one did not.  Looking purely at the science involved in the book I'll give Leiber credit for at least thinking of it.  It's a nice premise to theorize the gravitational impact of what would happen to the Earth if a planet the same size as it called, "The Wander" suddenly appeared in space next to it.  He does a decent job covering the effects this would cause to the Earth and the Moon with the changing of the tides, flooding, earth quakes, and volcanic activity, but I think he may have missed the effects that the gravitational pull of Earth would have had on "The Wander" as well.  I also had trouble with several of the characters who seem right out of the 60's.  In the 60's there must have been a great deal of mistrust between the populous and the government and several of the characters reflect this feeling in that, "The Man", or "The Fuzz" are out to get them.   It also appeared that there had been no advances in science on the Earth since the 60's but yet we have a manned base on the Moon and have astronauts out by Mars.  It just didn't add up 
 The first version of Easy CD Creator I used was CD Creator 4 basic. It was okay, pretty much what it said it was: basic. I got the upgrade to that from an Ebay auction and it worked pretty good. Later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new CDRW drives in good old version 4, I upgraded to CD Creator 5 Platinum (The version being sold here.) This too worked pretty good - for a little while. Then the operation was moved over from Adaptec to Roxio, and from that point onward, things have been more thorny than rosy.  Roxio will REQUIRE you to register the product in order to download the (ONE) utterly essential update to keep this thing running. Perhaps you don't mind that, but I feel it's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy. Plus you have to keep track  of your password to the website and if you change ISP's you will have to RE-REGISTER. A hassle to say the least. Also , since Roxio took the reins, there are no further updates being provided. Instead Roxio tries to "encourage" (read "browbeat") you into getting the software upgrade for even more money. This upgrade will NOT work on Win98SE, which I still use for various reasons. So IF I were to upgrade the software AGAIN, I would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that I need and still use. If you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making, I applaud you. I prefer to keep a little cash for retirement.       It is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form, and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face, such as getting "Illegal Request" errors from Direct CD, or inability to format or erase CDRW's that was once possible in version 4. Also, any CDRW's created in version 4 MAY NOT be readable with the new software, or at the least there are some technical issues with this. At any rate, it is not neccessarily all that "EASY" unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand (or are willing to learn) some of the finer technical points in CD recording technology. I prefer not to be bothered with it, I just want to create some CDs.      I now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all, especially Direct CD, a program that originally provided the ability to do "drag and drop" writing of files to a Read/Write CD. Now I find that Direct CD is non-functional, and the only CD's I can write are CDR's, and there are problems growing in that area as well. Speed of the CDRW or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue. The software simply refuses to work as it once did.  It shouldn't be called "EASY CD Creator". Perhaps "IRRITATING" CD Creator would be more appropriate.   In Summary: This does not deserve stars. Perhaps a few "BLACK HOLES"? While I once would have given wholehearted supported this product, regrettably I cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now.    
 The first 2 books in Lackey's Dragonjouster series were excellent.  The author created a new world, new scenarios, new theme and did them well.  Imagine my surprise when I read 'Sanctuary' the third installment in this series.  It seems that the author, after throwing herself fully into the first 2 books, has lost interest in them and was mainly just trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible and finish the series.  'Sanctuary' could have been a satisfying end to Vetch/Kiron's story...as it was, I was left wanting... 
 This book was almost a complete waste of time. Why almost? It offered a few good tips for teenagers who are beginning to use makeup (emphasis on the "few"). However, not everyone wants the natural look, and not every teenager is a beginner. Also, Bobbi tends to overgeneralize and neglects to consider the self-esteem of those who have blonde hair and blue eyes (like me). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, even beginners. There are books written by makeup artists who don't want to be the Hitler of the makeup world 
 I read constantly and mostly light murder mysteries-meaning nothing gory etc. Gone was very boring and I believe so is because there are just too many characters-It was difficult to keep them all straight.There didn't seem to be much of a plot until practically the end.I have read Mr Kellerman's books before and found them a lot more enteraining than this one. Also he uses words I never heard before to describe something,rather than stopping to look it up I would have to guess, otherwise I'd lose what little plot there was at the time. Also I get offended when the dirty 4 letter words are used-granted it was only by one character-but neither needed to be in the story line. 
 the book is really boring, its like an interminable speec 
 I am so unhappy about buying this book.  I went on to check out Mr Young only to find some very interesting issues this man has had along with some of his co workers. I find it to be all about the Money , not that everyone isnt interested in money.  However there are much better books by pros that are serious and do not try to scare you into buying their oils.    Sorry,  once again  very upset about spending the amount of money on this book. 
 like i said before, he should stick with music and mabye acting. This book is not very good.   If you liked this book check out all of Tim McGraws, Books & Musi 
 I can't post any review about this item cause, although I ordered it on NOVEMBER 5th, 2005  I haven't received it until now, FEBRUARY 14th, 2006 
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 It looks cute (like Martha Stewart's magazines) but did not contain one usefull piece of advice.  Since most of us only do this once, there is not too much personal experience to draw from.  Therefore we look to the professionals for ideas, sample wording and help.  This was total waste of time unless I was going to have each invitation hand written or tied with a rhinestone buckle 
 I have about two to three years of Knit N Style (2001 - 2003)Magazines, and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a Cardigan Pattern to Knit for myself.  I haven't found a single one.  All of the patterns have serious faults: Drop Shoulders, (totally unacceptable) little or no armhole, neck and/or shoulder shaping. Most sleeves have little or no cap. And, worst of all, they are all made in five or more pieces. Haven't any of these "designers" heard of Elizabeth Zimmerman?  I was going to give the lot to the library, but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place.  If you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people, why don't you teach them the PROPER way to knit?  Young people are smarter than you think 
 Ever wonder for which bipolar monomaniac the Sorcerer's Apprentice worked? Now you know. Drier than Dryden, boot-licking admirer of the thief of his childhood, humorless bookworm of a dusty aristocrat, protonerd ex machina in extremis. When Continent-lazing navel-gazers concern themselves with improving society, oil your firearms. I'd rather a deep belly laugh than Mill's musings, any day 
 To borrow a riff from PJ, if this is literature, I'd hate to see what drivel looks like... I've always enjoyed PJ's hilarious rants as he skewered stupidity and political correctness, while keeping his political beliefs (for the most part) under the hood, where they rightly belonged.  Sadly, in this case, the dual curse of flat humor laced with bitterness and the burden of a lost political cause (the defense of Dubya) combine to transform this from "must buy" to "pick it up when you please because it will languish on the library shelves".  I had to force myself to finish this, and will say that the final postscript was the best part of the whole. 
 This game system is horrible. My son w anted it for Xmas and he played it once cause its so bad. The graphics are like PS1 at best and the load times are unbearable. Im' talking a good 5 minutes just to get started...stay away from this. 
 Do not even think about!!! I love KitchenAid products but what a lemon they should be ashamed. The first one broke during shipping the second one on the first use I DO NOT RECOMEND go and get the mushroom,egg,kiwi slicer built with blades to last not thin wire 
 I had one stubborn blackhead at the corner of my lip that compelled me to order this. It did work remarkably well on that blackhead, but then I couldn't leave well enough alone. I must have messed up my pores, because now for the first time IN MY LIFE (I'm 29), I have acne on my chin. The chin is the only place I used this tool (other than that initial blackhead) and now it's one problem after another. Not just whiteheads either, cysts that are inflammed and itchy! The only thing that I've done differently with my skin routine is use this, and it's caused me nothing but problems. Leave the pore unclogging to a professional; you're opening up quite a can of worms if you take this upon yourself. 
 This book sucks so bad.  All of the redundant crap that everyone makes  kids read about the Holocaust is so depressing.  We all understand that  WWII was a terrible thing and that the Axis forces did hideous things to  Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, etc.  Do we have to keep reading about  it?  I feel like my brain has been drained!  It's all so depressing, so  negative.  Move on, people.  I might sound insensitive...sure, this was an  atrocious thing and deeply affected those involved, but move on.  My priest  says that we bear our own crosses.  The Holocaust is NOT going on now.  We  need to learn from what happened (I have!) and MOVE ON 
 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.    Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.    Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film.   In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)  The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better 
 Dr. Doolittle fell afoul of the PC police, before they were so named. This edition has been adulterated to maintain political correctness and there is no indication of this unless you read the afterword.  Great story, bad edition 
 Ms. Morgan, the story-teller, spins some good yarn, presents a few ideas and generic truths - but she is no writer 
 This book is terrible! It's horribly written complete with dialogue that is as trite and flat as a bad 80s sitcom. It starts off with a passive unemployed stay-at-home father whose wife appears to be having an affair. It then develops into a highly boring and implausible tale about nanoparticles trying to take over the world, or trying to eat us all, or something. I don't think Crichton ever really got that far in his thinking.  ***possible spoilers below***  This book is very important in pinpointing a few useful life-rules:  1. Anyone who looks like they have lost weight/bulked up is dangerous! (Those nanoarticles are deadly, but boy, do they help ones' body image)  2. There is nothing much out-of-the-ordinary about a mother slapping her baby when she gets home from work. In fact, if anything, you should always be the one to apologise...it doesn't matter for what.  3. If you're trying to get a few crazy nanoparticles to rule the world, make sure the FIRST thing you do is call in the main guy who is able to destroy your whole big plan.  4. Nanoparticles bear a striking resemblance to sandflies. They say they're thousands of times small than a hairs' breadth...but don't worry, when they buzz around you'll see them no problems. They also have the ability to bite.  The whole things is so badly written from start to finish that it wasn't even a  guilty pleasure! The characters are all so one dimensional and the whole thing towards the end (Ricky and Julia being coated in nanoparticles?!?!) is just ridiculous.   Plot holes are abound, for example, why on earth would this thing need to be transferred via saliva/kissing? They're nanoparticles! If they can buzz around and take differennt shapes etc, then surely they can fly into whatever or wherever they wish.  The BIGGEST surprise for me was that in the end, our 'hero' manages to save the world from these critters with explosions, a trusty sidekick, and some kind of virus that the plant has been haroburing all along.  If someone can give me back my 2 days that I spent reading this rubbish I'd be eternally grateful. I'd ask for my money back, but the book was given to me for free by a bookstore. Obviously they knew its true worth 
 Perhaps this book should have been titled My Life Raising Bettas to Sell to Pet Shops.  It is more interesting as autobiography than a reference.  There are only seven pages of basic betta care.  The majority of the chapters are related to breeding and raising bettas for a pet shop market.  The section on fin forms and colors and color variations would make a handy basic reference---if it had pictures to illustrate the descriptions.  It does have a lot of color pictures and the captions provide some of the most concise and interesting information.  If you have an interest in economical fish raising and selling, this book has information for you.  Don't buy it as your basic reference, do buy it for the pictures 
 This guy sucks.. he does not ship the item. I have to send he soo many emails and he does have the audocity to say "u chose the 6-8 days option" I always buy my books from amazon and the sellers have been great.they ship it off immediately and i get the book in a week. this guy!!?? what do I say??? dont get your stuff from him..get it from someone else even if it costs a couple more dollars..its worth i 
 The author seemed very confused on how to end this novel.  He write a lovely story about an unlikely friendship in a troubled neighborhood.  Unable to come to an ending, he takes the book into a Harry Potter land of make believe.  Make up your mind what type of genre you're writing for 
 I found this book to contain many recipes that contain ingredients that I can't have (I'm in the early stages of treatment so fruits, nuts, some grains, etc. are out for now) and many ingredients that Dr Crook suggests avoiding for a while in newer books. I'm sure the recipes will be more usefull after I've completed treatment and I'm working on maintenance, but that's not what I needed right now. Some tips on how to cook beans and veggies were somewhat helpfull but I think there are better books out there for the early staged of treatment. Consider getting it from your library before buying it 
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 I found this book a presumtious, hypocritical waste of tree. I found his ideas to be heavily influenced by patriarchal society. This man should not be allowed to quote Tillich but since he did he should have at least done the man justice. His attempt to define the role of sexuality in these instances were meager. See Thomas Moore for an excellent look into sexuality and human relationships. Use this book for a coaster 
 This is a very disappointing work. Even given the paucity of biographical data on Catullus, a good "life and times" work could have been written about this poet at the nexus of some of the most intense political and sexual intrigue ever.   This is not that book. It reads like it was written one paragraph a day: it's repetitive, meandering, unstructured, and riddled with generalities, unsubstantiated "everybody knows" opinions in lieu of scholarship and a few outright whoppers of historical errors.   I've never gone to the trouble of posting a bad review before, but this book is so dreadful that I feel obligated to post a warning to others.   The author's approach to the sexuality at the heart of Catullus's work is equally muddled, occasionally viewing sexuality from the Roman perspective but often veering off into the perjorative language of a bookish, sexist erotophobia.  
 My take-away was pretty easy to define: If you are healthy or wealthy and have a guaranty that you will stay that way forever then go with the author's advice.  A state funded health program that in my case has a cost of $972.00 per month, is not a realistic option.  Sure I can save money by purchasing a seperate policy for the rest of my family, but how realistic is insurance for our family at $1,200 to $1,500 per month?  If I have high income then, OK, I've got the savings. But who worries about the savings of $1,500 per month when you have to pay out $1,800 to get it?  Answer: a person with lots of income.  This sounds like a book written by an insurance salesman - hey, it is! 
 I am trying to learn enough Korean to be able to function in Korea even if on my own. The words chosen for the flash cards are not much help for what I wanted (unless I am at the zoo). This is a great concept but...if you are like me and want to learn words that will help you communicate in everyday situations save some money and make your own flash cards 
 I am sure he is an amazing mathematician, but I found this book to be the most horrible linear book I have ever seen. The text that was bolded and italicized was inconsistent and therefore very confusing especially in a book which employs bold face to denote specific mathematical qualities. Furthermore, the conversational style and lack of fluidity had a synergy that would drive even the craziest mathematician crazier. I would reco Lay's or Pooles or Bronson's (this might be my favorite because it is proof intensive). Again, he is a better mathematician than I will ever be, even if he was wasted, but I would not reco this book to any first semester linear student, go for one of the aforementioned authors 
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 I have not yet read this book.  It looks exciting and I hope I enjoy it.  I am reading this book for a report in JROTC 
 Ok lets get down to why you should save your money and NOT get this book. First of all the author dedicates two or three chapters on WHY chicks should sleep with chicks. Well if your buying this book then I would think that your already curious or interested, correct? Then the author shares some really great "secrets" on the where and how to pick up other chicks, let me take the time to write some of them down here for you, first this no brainer, "Get them intoxicated, and my all time favorite,"take them behind a dumpster and get them to smoke weed". The author then fills the book up with helpfull hints like, "go put an ad on the internet"  Dang, I would have never thought of that!! In summary, you can buy this book if you want, but don't expect anything other than common sense stuff, and I use the term VERY lightly!! Thank you for your time.  
 This book was published too early. By that I mean, Java EE 5 was not finalized so the code examples starting in chapter 9 don't work. Another example is chapter 10 titled EJB Entity Beans. According to the Sun tutorial, Entity Beans have been replaced by the Java Persistence API 
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 This is nothing like yo la tengo, which prompted amazon's recommendation of this album. This is butt slam disco pop. Hey, the production is fine, and they have sultry melodies, butt if you like yo la tengo or my morning jacket or grizzly, this may or may not jive with your sensibilities. The breathy guy vocals seem contrived. Oh well, at least Eagles of Death Metal still rock 
 The New World is the least of Terrence Malick's limited filmography to date, and could be best described as a monotone poem. It's not exactly bad, just mundane and rather forgettable even while you're watching it, more of a self-indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience. Visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired, while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections from his classical music collection, which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out: even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings. Another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific Colin Farrell, a nice enough lad offscreen I'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he's given. True to form he trots out his two `important picture' expressions - the Bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he's not been getting enough roughage in his diet. The fact that he's outshone by Q'orianka Kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy, although to be fair he has been worse. Indeed, among the male leads Christian Bale does much, much more with much, much less in the last third of the film, as does a typically underused Christopher Plummer in the first third.   Malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of Jamestown, but because it happens to people we've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight. If anything, it just made me think of how much more Herzog could have made of it all. Moments work, most notably the expulsion of the `Naturals' from their land and the brief latter sequences in England, but on the evidence of the 135-minute version I very much doubt Malick's promised longer cut will solve the problems. I know it's meant to be a work of art, but I just came away with the feeling that I'd watched an old and very average Universal International 50s Western redubbed by first-year philosophy students. The only surprise was that Jeff Chandler and his bouncing Basques didn't crop up. 
 Another in the series of misadventures and deadbeat characterizations.  Stick with the FLASHMAN series, or anything by Swift, to see how this genre should be done 
 This book has nothing to offer, except for those of you who now nothing about Orisha Tradition, and are curious. Otherwise don't waste your time and money.. 
 Okay, I like Chris Rock... a little... well, maybe not. But reguardless, this movie is horrible. If Bill Muray all of a sudden turned black, and he landed the role, this movie would STILL be awful. Chris Rock is a horrible actor (Raul Julia is better, and one of his movie's landed in the TV show of movie shame, Mystery Science Theater 3,000) and in my opinion, he has a lot of stale, predictable humor. The movie plot is shallow, the acting horrible, the side romatic story couldn't be worse; let's face it, this movie is a slice of crap a la mode with bland tasting ice cream. I give this movie two starts because this will NEVER happen, it's a very far-fetched story, even for Hollywood (the only reason it doesn't get one star is because the chick in the movie is hot). If it ever does, I'm moving somewhere safer, like Cuba or North Korea. Alright, well, since no one will probably read this, I'm stopping. Just save yourself some time and money, do NOT watch this horrible excuse for a movie 
 On disk # 2 some of the tracks "skip" when played and are inaubible.  Have not yet played all of the disks, but was disappointed to find this lack of quality - especially when the book topic stresses the importance of quality. 
 I'm sure you've read the plot synopsis by now, so I'll skip it and get to the real review.  This book is a long, contrived, boring piece of unrealistic drivel.  This guy went to Harvard?  It reads like an Encyclopedia Brown mystery, except you figure it all out much quicker.  The characters are underdeveloped and frighteningly unrealistic (not to mention just plain stupid.  It took them 400 pages to figure out what was going on?  Maybe they went to Harvard, too).  Evidently, in Dr. Cook's world nobody ever utters an obscenity or does anything risque or more involved than "making love."  We get pages and pages about a man having an affair with his business associate, been when it comes to the pivotal moment the experience is summed up in two words.  Sounds like Cook is as prudish as his main characters.  Skip this book unless you enjoy mind-bogglingly bad literature (a la "Mystery Science Theater 3000", perhaps).  This is my first, and last, Robin Cook novel 
 The review for this book states that you will find "revealing" photgraphs and invites you to walk into the private world of the hip hop producer, etc, etc.  I was looking for a book that would give captions that at least detailed the equipment in each home studio.  Instead, what you get is a bunch of nearly useless photos with no captions.  Most of the photos are taken from such a deep perspective that you can't even make out what you are looking at.  My favorites are the close up picture of the torn up chair and close up picture of a sub being held together with duct tape.  Those wasted close ups should have been directed towards the equipment.  There are a couple of studios where pictures were close enough to see the artists racks but for the most part the pictures are way too "abstract."  I would not recommend buying this book new.  You will look at it once and never pick it up again 
 This one was not like Flyy Girl and what I do not consider this to be a sequel. Very disappointe 
 People who enjoy this book seem to characterize it as an original work of sci-fi/fantasy and a thought-provoking exploration of insanity, which interests me very much.  However, I found this book to be neither original nor an adequate account of someone's "descent" into or recovery from madness.  The premise is intriguing enough as the novel begins, gradually revealing the story of an amnesiac/schizophrenic patient being admitted to a psych ward, who turns out to be a professor at Cambridge.  Immediately, the reader is thrown into 50 pages or so of stream of conciousness ramblings that were quite frankly difficult to trudge through.  This put a bad taste in my mouth, possibly tainting the rest of the book for me.  The remainder really wasn't terribly interesting; I found Lessing's writing style to be excruciatingly boring and lacking any sort of insight.  Other reviews of this book tend to fall to the extremes of loving it or hating it; I guess that means I hated it.  So maybe I just didn't "get" it...personally, I don't think there was anything to "get".  
 So often it seems like an adequate book is well loved just because it appears in an "unusual" genre. If this book was about anything but wizards, it would be considered mildly entertaining, but not much else. I found it neither very intellectually stimulating, nor focused around an incredible plot. Of course, people can like what they like, but I feel like this book was a real let down. 
 Very basic book that covers no new ground.  Go to your local library and find a fitness/weight lifting book.  You won't miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book.  
 Hi, i got the book to enforce my knowledge about Vb and Databases. People PLEASE DO ME A FAV AND DON'T buy this boo 
 No matter how one feels about Peter Singer as an ethicist, this books shows he's thoroughly incompetent as an editor. I am rather surprised that Oxford University agreed to put its imprint on this volume as an "Oxford Reader." The selections from pivotal ethicists, e.g., Aristotle, Kant, Hume, Bentham, and Sidgwick are ridiculously lowly, inconsequential, or scattered, so "coherence" is lost. Their minor pericopes omit their critical and vital insights; all their important ideas are egregiously overlooked. E.g., Aristotle's doctrine of the mean, eudaimonia, Kant's doctrine of Kingdom of Ends, Categorical Imperative, are just some of the major omissions. Natural law theory doesn't mention the name of Aquinas. The selections that support an evolutionary orientation are a little bit better. The selection from Hume on benevolence is marginal. The essays by Ayer and Wittgenstein are great, but not enough to justify this book. I can't imagine what this book is good for. It certainly fails as an introduction to ethics. It also fails as a current controversy in ethics. It might be used as an intermediate ethics course for some of the pericopes. To say this book is a disappointment is an understatement.  Disclaimer: Singer is a utilitarian. I don't know how anyone in the 21st C. can use utilitarianism as an "ethic" much less as a system of "morality." Scheffler, Williams, Nozick, et alia should have put this nonsense to rest, as Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, and even Hitler were great utilitarians, which is precisely the point. But that aside, I think it skews his editorial judgments as well. For ethics, Aristotle, for morality, Kant, and for benevolence, Smith and Hume. Otherwise, leave the utilitarian calculus for tyrants 
 Editorial Reviews  Amazon.com essential video After initially rejecting the role as too sentimental, Ginger Rogers found the title character of Kitty Foyle to be an Oscar winner and a career breakthrough. Released in 1940, only a year after her nine-picture partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Kitty Foyle helped establish Rogers as a nonmusical box-office star. The film portrays a white-collar working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from Mark (James Craig), a kindly but humble doctor. As soon as she accepts, however, she receives a different proposition, this one from her former love, wealthy socialite Wyn (Dennis Morgan), who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks Kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in South America. Kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love. Rogers gives an appealing performance as the feisty yet vulnerable Kitty, who makes up in moxie what she lacks in social status. Did she really deserve the Best Actress Oscar over Bette Davis in The Letter, Joan Fontaine in Rebecca, Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story, and Martha Scott in Our Town? Well, evidently Rogers had real-life moxie too. --David Horiuchi   Product Description Known for light comedies and her partnership with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into 1940's Oscar spotlight with her Best Actress turn as Kitty, an indomitable working-class girl who endures the rejection of Philadelphia society, makes her own way as a single woman and ultimately chooses between an unmarried arrangement with Main Line scion Wynnewood Strafford VI (Dennis Morgan) or marriage to a struggling physician (James Craig). Rogers' deserved Academy Award confirmed she was more than a dance star - a fact humorously underscored when she returned to the studio and was greeted by staffers and actors in top hats and tails. Jane Wyman won the Best Actress Academy Award for her sensitive portrayal of Belinda, capturing the girl's affecting isolation, awakening desire to learn and ultimate triumph. Directed by Jean Negulesco and co-starring Lew Ayres, Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead (all four Oscar nominees* for their fine work), Johnny Belinda (nominated for a total 11 Oscars including Best Picture) blends atmosphere, nuance and high drama into a heartbreaking classi 
 If you have never seen any books by this author before then I would recommend purchasing "Zoom".  It's amazing which made me slightly disappointed with this one.  I was hoping it would be just as good as the first but it was harder to follow and wasn't as fun to look at.  I wish I had not bought it 
 Just read the software documentation and save your money. Hardly any difference 
 What a bunch of hypocrits. This is a radical left-wing hate book. If you are a Hollywierdo, alcoholic, drug addict, socialist, communist, (...), then you will love this book.  In other words, this book is  for anyone who loves their sin and doesn't want God in their life.  Understandable, why would anyone who chooses to destroy their own life want to hear someone preach against it?  According to this book anyone who believes in God, Jesus, religion, faith, decency, and clean living is a "fundamentalist".  Which group do you belong to? Whoops, does that makes me a fundamentalist?  Well, I'm not. Being a conservative Chrisitian is not necessarily being a fundamentalist. This is nothing but a hate book, which is typical of the new American left that has taken over the Democratic party 
 I never got this book and I have tried numerous time to get my money back and I have only gotten the runaround. Why wont you respond to the fact that I never got this book and is anything going to be done about it. 
 After reading the storyline of this movie, it seems like a framing movie, so I didn't even bother to watch it because framing movies piss me off.   
 I've tried a several Catherine Coulter novels and all have the same theme: 1980's style bodice rippers where sex hurts (bloody, painful, rapist stuff), heroes are villainous cads, and heroines just take the abuse until they turn into abusers themselves.  This book is no different. There's the incestuous relationship of Marcus and Josephine being 1st cousins. Marcus acting like a complete cad flaunting his mistresses and showing absolutely no regard for anyone besides himself. Love scenes that are abusive, painful acts of rape. And of course no story that could possibly resemble a love story.  Why Coulter's books sell is beyond me. She writes like a masogynistic man insulting the feminine ideal of love. Her novels always make me feel sick 
 I don't know what Walmart these girls came from, but the ones I've been to only seem to staff homely, short, fat, goblin-like women. I smell a deception here. There's absolutely NO WAY IN H*LL that girls which look like this would have such a job. You'd find them working at espresso booths or something, where all the babes seem to be.  I think in this case PLayboy is appealing to our "fantasies" of seeing "regular girls from Walmart-type jobs" naked, but they couldn't possibly have found such quality at one of the actual stores. 
 If you knows Linux system well enough, don't buy this book. This is only for Linux beginner and doesn't have enough detail to go deep enough inside Linux. You may better off just looking at internet.  
 I think the only person that should read this is a person that loves or knows a lot about sailing. Even though the decreption was good I got really comfusid in the good parts of the book. Anyone that doesnt like or has no  clue about sailing should not read this book! 
 The pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove.  One picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play 
 I suppose I was expecting something differant...more of a focus on the apartments. It just dragged on and on. I really was not interested in the individual investments of people (no matter how famous). Photos would have been nice. I was expecting a history not an book on economics and investments 
 Sometimes she raves and sometimes she rants, the really interesting parts are when she tries to do both at the same time.    This book is better then "Treason" because it stays away from a topic that Ann knows nothing about (the history of the Cold War) and stays more towards current events.    And that's fine everyone is entitled to an a point of view the problem with Ann's arguments in all of her books are threefold   1.  I'm right and you're wrong 2.  I don't have to listen to you  3.  I don't even have to acknowledge that you exist (look at the title)   So what it all boils down to are examples that are as idiotic as the premise. Maybe in Ann's world of rich people we can all ignore each other if we have differing political views but in the real world where we have to work for a living it isn't like that.     Overall-Don't waste the energy or the time.   
 You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of "moist" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one.  
 Lasted three days then stopped playing.  If you buy this, you're an idiot 
 I couln't even finish the book.  It was one big boring story of Xerox and what they did and did not do.  There were other examples but I could not keep my eyes open 
  i have to say i love cheryl lynn this album is great  but it's missing some very good song's she did a tune for the 1985 movie called heavenly bodies the song at last you're mine is an excellant track it peaked at #34 for a whole 10 weeks so i agree with the previous comment and the song fidelity so in order to be called a greatest hits all the song's should be in joel whitburns top r&b boo 
 I found the book worth not just borrowing, but actually buying, partly because there just isn't much out there in the way of "so, now you know you're a vampire, where do you go from here?" material on the market. Real vampires face a dearth of written information. I have to give Belanger credit for trying to solve the problem.  On the other hand, it's good that her introduction advises the reader to "find your own truth," because you won't find much truth between the covers of her book. Most of it is written for Kheprians, and if you don't see yourself as a Kheprian (or believe that a Kheprian temple exer existed in prehistoric Egypt, or see a proto-Egyptian group of occult workers who severed themselves from the forces of life as the origin of true psychic vampirism) then applying the advice in the book requires a bit of mental gymnastics.   Furthermore, for the general reader, the information on basic psychic technique is available in any other new age or pagan text, many of which are listed in the extensive bibliography that somehow never actually gets used in the Codex for real honest-to-George-Burns quotes. For the advanced reader, there are some interesting passages on feng shui (read advanced stuff, that), psychic surgery, exorcism, and the undesirableness of astral fleas.  All this makes for entertaining reading, but as with Aleister Crowley's _Book of the Law_, keep your BS detector turned on and beeping 
    This HGW novel is not as satisfying as his more famous  sci fi pieces, but it is representative of turn-of-the-century interest in galactic exploration.  Related in the first person by an impoverished would-be playwright, Mr. Bedford (for whom no first name is given), the story opens as he makes the acquaintance of an eccentric scientist named Cavor in a coastal area of England.  Gradually persuaded by the latter's dreams of conquering gravity by means of a substance he will eventually invent, Bedford soon becomes an enthusiastic convert to theoretical astronomy; he injects some practical ideas-as well as his private dreams of avarice and proprietary empire.  Ah, the temptation of creating one's little sphere of power.       Embarking on an odyssey in a sphere made of Cavorite the partners in adventure land in a crater on the moon, where they encounter odd vegetation which flourishes during the two-week lunar day.  But even more amazing is their discovery of a species of intelligent beings (described by Cavor as ant-men) who dwell in the moon's interior.  When captured the two men fight their way back to the surface, but become separated.  Assuming that Cavor has been killed by the native Selenites (Cavor;s term for them),  Bedford manages to return to Earth, but the story does not quite end there.  What is the source of mysterious transmissions from the moon and--equally curious--what causes them to cease?  Wells' protagonists express the author's commentary on man's propensity for warfare and injudicious zeal to modulate alien civilizations due to our anthropomorphic egocentrism.  Nevertheless, this book offers great sci fi lore which will appeal to kids of all ages!      
 I've been looking forward to this album for quite some time, and man, what a bummer that this is what I've been waiting for.  After several listens, I still can't find even one song worth putting on a mix cd.  Come on, guys, you can do better than this 
 this book is too complicated for a beginner and is very messy. the pictures are terrible and have them posted a page after the explanation on the flash technique. i don't know how this person is a photog. she's far from one, you can see it from her pics. she shoots 60% of her images with a 20mm and 28mm lens using old flashes. the pictures come out terrible, distorted and badly lit pictures. they either are lit too much so you see the foreground blown out and the background dark or the picture looks nothing like what her technique explained. most aren't lit properly and all the portrait shots are overly flashed, and their face are super distrorted because the use of the wide angle lenses.who uses wide angle lenses for portraits??!! you can tell she cropped some of the pics that were used with a wide angle lens.i'd crop them to if they looked like hers did. she shows usage of 3 vivitar flashes and an umbrella for use in studio work. uh, excuse me..if i have money to buy 3 vivitar flashes i certainly have money for a studio strobe. they can even cost less that all of the 3 flashes considering the hardware needed to mount them all. all in all this book is very cluttered, and unprofessional. i'd think twice. i'd also like add there's no contact info in her book and on this website. i wouldn't leave contact info if i put out such a book 
 A writer for the Irish Echo said this book should have been titled "The Protocols of the Elders of Erin."  It was written around the time Al Smith was running for president and appealed to the nativist, anti-Catholic prejudices of upstate New York and America at that time.  While there really were gangs in that era, most of New York's immigrants were busy building hospitals and schools like St. Vincent's, Fordham, St. John's, Manhattan and Manhattanville.  The vast majority of the city's population including its immigrants didn't riot in 1863.  In fact New York City's 200,000 soldiers and sailors, more than half of whom were immigrants, won over 100+ Medals of Honor during America's Civil War.     It's a tribute to the persistence of prejudice that this book isn't more widely recognized as the nasty practical joke that it is 
 Great idea.  It took about a week, but after a period of time my cat loved it and now won't drink much without it.  But like so many modern products, consumerism runs rampant.  Unless you spend 15 to 30 minutes every two weeks to scrub it clean, expect to buy a new one every 6 months to a year.  Mine lasted about 8 months due to being continuously filled with water and cleaned. The main issue is poor material selection and saving about a buck on the motor. First, better quality brushless motors (freely available for incorporation into the design) would work here, but would add about a buck to material costs. This shows a design decision to trade quality for more sales due to burned out motors.  This warrants a recommendation to wait as a better quality competitor will likely soon arise and knock Drinkwell off.      Second, they made a design decision to use very cheap plastic that gets dirty and stains far too easily. A higher quality stain resistant plastic would also add a buck to their $40+ product.      Great product ... but wait for a competitor who will do things right 
 As many books the beginning of this one is excellent. But as you go over and over it gets boring and boring. The book has four stories that at the end will meet and all of them are stark boring. And at the end... just skip it. Better'd be if you skip this book 
 I have never listened to Nic before I bought this.  Real mediocre 80s disco sound. 
 As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery 
 I love most of the characters in the series but this book was hard to admire, or even like.  Morvan was so different from the other heros, who were sexy, handsome, loyal, intelligent, and they were men a woman could admire, but Morvan didn't even come close to being in this category.  Nothing wrong with arrogant men, but when that arrogance is due to conceit, and puffed-up self importance, and the belief that one thinks themselves all-important and that one's own wife should grovel at your feet, that man has zero appeal 
    I find Dr. Gabriel account of Islam to be disturbing. For one thing, the Quran tells his we have to believe in the revelations before the last revelation the Quran was revealed. Islam is the perfected religion, as said in the Quran. Dr. Gabriel speaks about contradictions then becomes a Christian. The Bible has been manipulated, altered, and purposely changed to suit the likes of Kings of there time. I once was a Christian, and ALL PRAISES DUE TO ALLAH, that I found Islam on my own after 9/11. The Quran tells us Muslims to submit to Islam on earth, do good deed, perform prayer (remembrance of ALLAH, the most Gracious and Merciful), and refrain from sin in order to receive Heaven in the Hereafter. To use Alcohol, as a meaning for contradiction is absurd. Alcohol and sin as we all know cause us to transgress against ALLAh and ourselves. I am sure AllAH knows the reason for abstaining Alcohol on earth. I am sad for Christians who were once Muslims only because christians believe Jesus is God, the son of God, and the holy spirit. When the first commandment clearly states: You Shall Have No Other Gods Before Me, yet christians share divinity with Jesus and a spirit. This is the reason for anger when people convert to other beliefs. There is only one GOD, and his name is ALLAH. Stop using the actions of some muslims to discredit Islam, for the Muslims who choose to act in barbaric ways will be judged by ALLAH, and ALLAH alone. Dr. Gabriel is a well-educated man, and I only pray that he would not compare Islam with Terrorism.   
 Okay, I confess I'm still plowing my way through this book. I'm on page 157, I think, and while the bodies were revealed way up front, everything else I've read thus far is Cissie being Cissie and Andy being dumber than a brick. A little of this mother-daughter dynamic went a long way in the first book, but this time it's simply over the top. As humor, it falls flat. As a mystery, it's *what* mystery? Maybe the second half of the book will pick up the pace a little, but getting there is a challenge I'm not certain I'm willing to take 
 I work as a therapist. In my work I have been positively influenced by the Jungian tradition, including James Hillman & Thomas Moore. I read this book hoping to gain a deeper understand the archetypal foundations of war. However I struggled to stay with Hillman. I struggled to stay with the details the horrors of war included in the book. War sickens me. I will not watch violent films or violent television. I struggle to watch war and acts of terrorism on the news. I already know. Enough is enough. My stuff... I know, but if you're like me; avoid this book. I also struggled to stay with Hillman because I am positively influenced by the inner core of Christianity. (I am also deeply critical of much of what passes for Christianity and often struggle to describe myself as Christian because of the stereotypes now associated with the word 'Christian'.) I believe that beneath the religious and cultural externals that adorn the Christian faith there exists a path; this path (eventually) leads to a unitive experience of the Divine and at the same time a grounded experience of becoming truly human. The Christ experience. One of the normal fruits of walking this path is a commitment to peace and justice: because, those who suffer in war, on both sides, are our brothers and sisters. I thus relate to the Christian contemplative tradition. For me this books great flaw is its unbalanced criticism of Christianity. On one hand Hillman rightly points out the way that sections of (cultural)Christianity have engaged in acts of war. He also rightly points to scripture's such as 'God is a God of war' that have been used to justify war. I would agree with these criticisms. However Hillman's criticism of Christianity is one sided. He assumes 'We are all psychologically Christian.' I would agree that the Western psyche is profoundly influenced by Christianity, but to me there is a world of difference between this unconscious influence and a person consciously attempting to live in the spirit of Christ. Those who are consciously attempting to live this way are usually committed peacemakers. (Take Thomas Merton and Desmond Tutu as two examples among many) Hillman ignores; both the actual teachings of Jesus regarding peace and the huge influence Christians have made, and continue to make, in the struggle to bring peace and justice. He seems to assume that all Christians are fundamentalist. They are not. It seems to me that Hillman himself is taking a fundimentalistic stance in his attack on Christianity. He becomes one sided, biased, narrow, strident. To me this is the major flaw in this book. I have given it two stars. It gets two for the way it has provoked me to think. It loses three for its simplistic bias.              
 This story looks at the L.A. Riots through the eyes of a child. Illustrator David Diaz used bold, thick acrylics on textured papers to illustrate the different scenes and then photographed those images for the book. The outcome is a surreal combination of the real and the imaged, reflective of the feelings one might having during a time of uncertainty. The story is short, almost too short. It attempts to show the riots from Daniel's point-of-view, but leaves out so much of the history of the riots, that they seem unfounded and decontexualized. Bunting's portrayal of this event is shallow and borders on racist. His mother's words "other" the predominantly black rioters, making them out to be thieving monsters and perpetuating negative stereotypes. This book may still find a use if only to promote discussion and get children thinking about what might have happened before the rioting began to make the people so angry. Otherwise, this book is an example of how beautiful illustrations can lead to a Caldecott seal and the book can still have an awful story 
 Like most people, I loved the original Friday - a true classic. I had heard that this one wasn't as good, so I rented a copy just to check it out for myself.  This movie is straight-up garbage. Mike Epps can't carry Chris Tucker's jock. What a waste of what could have been a very good movie series.  Stick with the original; don't waste your time or money on this one 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 This book is good as a primer if you want consider achieving a CCNA.  This book is not good as a study guide for the exam, due to its lack of granularity on most CCNA subjects 
 If you are looking for a direct common sense approach to managing fearful emotions, I don't think you will find it here as most of the book is somewhat abstract.  It is also very repititive 
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 I purchased this took and then found that it was just a reprint from several decades ag 
 this book just reifies the old boy/girl dichotomy.  we have to move on from finger pointing to some real issues.  are we really to believe that boys are being harmed by feminism? poor things...  is there really anything inherent in being a boy or girl.  We know that there is not, so how can people still be making these passe and inflamatory arguments.  Give me a break.  
 When I get a landscaping book I like to see plenty of examples in full color pictures. Maybe get a few ideas and see what others have come up with that I can mix and integrate into my own water garden. This book is 95% wording and 5% pictures. I thought the book was a little dry and uninteresting. I'm glad I got it on E-Bay for $2.50 because I would never pay full price for it 
 I bought this hairdryer and it worked really well for one week, but then it just DIED on me. ONE WEEK 
 I couldn't even get 2 chapters into the book. It is that boring to me! Might try and read some other time but for now, going back to the library it goes 
 This had a great summary to look forward to. It didnt deliver one bit, I was really creeped out that this stupid lady would take her child back to the place where she was violently raped and beaten just to get revenge. This is a case of ultra neo feminism where your pride takes precident over your childs well being. Skip this book and take your kids out to a park instea 
 If you want erotic, stop at the cover. The stories are a mixture of TS guys 'fooling' men into having anal sex with them, boring stories like a woman trying to talk her husband into having anal sex with her (what man doesn't want this), submissive males, a story about chemistry and physics that mad no sense and equally boring other stories. Neither I or my gf found them the slightest bit erotic. 
 Unfortunately I received the items damaged.  The exterior postage box was unharmed but the paper boxes were obviously dropped at some point before packaging. 
 This book is not likely to tell you anything that you don't know already from reading the newspapers.  The authors wrote in the introduction that it requires advanced knowledge of finance and accounting to comprehend the material.  Nothing like that.  A couple of basic accounting courses are all you need to read it.  It is redundant.  It didn't tell me anything new although if I were a sophomore in college then maybe I would have learned something.  Don't expect to get any insight into the financial numbers game.  It is a little more than a basic review of current accounting issues.  If you read business publications from time to time then you are already well familiar with everything the book has to say 
 I agree with R. Eastwood on mostly of what he says.  Despite that, I have to say that I enjoyed it, since this is one of the few western movies in the genre. Or at least with some decency.  It's a strange movie. It seems that it was written in a hurry, without a real plot purpose. What did it conveyed?   Mr. Lambert really shows his lack of minimun skills in martial arts (And I thought I had seen the worst with David Carradine!)  It's a movie without a main character. It is not Kijo, not Takeda, not even Racine.  I was expecting Takeda to be the real deal, the guy with knowledge and values, but in the end was the real bastard, even more than Kijo.   If we talk about performances, ufff.. Lambert doesn't make it at all, not even the guy who plays Takeda. Whoever, Kijo was excellent !    They introduce this swordsmith character, which is completely out of line. He's a drunkard, at the same time a teaser and an swordsman, who actually teaches Racine a few ninja moves (he knows some ninja style but he's the swordsmith of a samurai???....). The end is a very sad moment because all of these guys in the island die, even Takeda, and Kijo, BUT.....the drunkard comes in a samurai gear, ready for action, and Racine, as nothing had happened, give him a stupid/funny comment.....What was that??????????  On the positive side ....I have to say that the swords choreography wasn't that bad, the kendo fight was alright, and this guy John Long (Kijo) seems to have real knowledge of swordsmanship.  As a conscientious student of Kendo and Iaido, my real delight was the master piece The Last Samurai. One of my top three movies. From every angle, the movie really made it. The performances, the casting, the fight scenes, the narratives, dialogues, photograpies, costumes, the story, the depth of the characters .... so perfect and beautiful I can't believe it. A real gift for us practioners of the japanese sword. 
 Who wudda thunk it?  Chris Russo can read and write 
 There are so many problems with this book it is difficult to know where to start. The author tries to make a case that the bombing of Germany and Japan was immoral but fails miserably. What were the Allies to do? Don't bomb because someone might get hurt? This was a war that we could not afford to lose. Any and all methods HAD to be employed against the enemy.  While it is true that bombing alone did not win the war, this was not known in 1943. There is no doubt that the bombing of Germany and Japan shortened the war.  Whatever you think of this book, the author's attempt to equate the bombing in World War 2 to the 9/11 attacks destroy any credibility the author may have had on the subject.    
 A little backgound about me, I graduated in Telecommunication field, i am a Cisco certified, and working in the networking field, and it is happened that my job now require me more Micosoft and Redhat Linux certified.  all i can say about this book is Useless and Disappointed. i can not express how disappointed i am with this microsoftpress book. it is such a wast of money and time.  the book is hard to read, each concept is not explained well at all, not deepth. especially the review questions in the book,each chapter has about 3-6 review questions, the question are decided just for kids, really... the questions in the book are very easy and not enuf they r no point and stupid.i am sure in the real exam, there will not b any questions simply ask "group policy is ______?" or "you can share _______ connection in home or small office by using ICS-Internet Connection Sharing" (asnwer=Internet). can u see how simple and stupid the questions are, and turely it just ask like this in the book.  I decided to stop and look for other resources, stop now, better than wasting my time (which i already wast my money for the book itself).  i strongly don't recommend this book to anyone, easpecialy who is preparing for exam, this book won't bring u to anywhere close.  if you want to donate your money, better make it somewhere else, not Bill's pocket, he is surely alot far richer than u, u should know that.  Disappointed --- Shall i buy MicrosoftPress' product again 
 Etta never fails to deliver in the vocals. Gutteral bombast, sweet soul, gospel, blues, the lady is a living legend. But this album, like the last album "produced" by her son, is a nightmare. Chessy arrangments, tinkly bass, poor sound all around. She is a fierce mother and I'm sure she thinks her kids know best, but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer. Should Etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck, she wouldn't need the novelty of some of the song choices.  PS - 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer; blues, R/B, soul, whatever,  in the world. 
 Dr. David Beck is a pediatrician who is still grievibg the loss of his wife Elizabeth, 8 years ago. Elizabeth was supposedly murdered when was kidnapped all that time ago. All this time later as David still searches for clues as to what really happened-appears a message on his computer, It is a warning which reads "Tell No One." Tell no one what though? This writer keeps giving warnings to David, and the next thing he sees is Elizabeth's picture waving at him looking as though she is still alive and well-and maybe she is. But in the process, David is getting framed for strings of murders, as someone is against him, and wants revenge. And this person will stop at nothing to get David, And not only that, but he just knows that Elizabeth is still alive after receiving clues to meet her at a resort.   I thought the book had too many twists and turns at once, and in places was disjointed as well. However, it kept me interested until the end 
 This book is sloppily edited, with numerous typos in the equations. Page 91 has two symbolic errors plus a text error. Overbar omitted twice on page 19 giving a nonsensical formula Z = (X - X)/ 
 This cargo carrier is so flimsy that I thought it would fall apart before I got to my destination.  The hinges are a joke and barely work.  It is also a nightmare to assemble 
 This is just another book about the holocaust and hungarian jews, and not one of the good ones.The title and back cover has little to do with the book itself, The few American POWs stories are there only to justify the title of the book. It's a shame to use our soldiers in order to sell a book that otherwise would end up in the clearence section not long after printed 
 Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... "LMN"(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, "As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word "radio" and we'll double what we're giving you." Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies. 
 The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer. 
 This book is more for the psychiatric professional and not for a person who is trying to become more mindful.  The first half of the book focused on mindlessness.  The second half of the book focused on experiments done with various groups of people and how those experiments helped those people become more mindful 
 I must agree with the negative reviewers that this pan's nonstick coating began coming off almost immediately after I began using it.  I'm not talking about scratches, which often are a result of using the wrong kind of implements for cooking and cleaning.  My pan began pock all over, even up the sides where I rarely touch them.  I hung on to this pan for 3 years, simply because I could not bear to part with it for the expense.  But eventually I had to treat it like my other All-Clad pans (which I LOVE) and use full amounts of oil to cook.  It was no longer worth using.  Although the reviewer who loves this pan was "certain" the rest of us who have not liked this pan were not caring for the pan properly, that "certainty" is based on nothing but speculation.  I cared for my pan precisely according to the directions provided by All-Clad.  Of course, I could have asked All-Clad to replace it early on, since it was clear the nonstick coating was coming off on its own accord.  But that would not have changed the fact that the coating on my pan was coming off 
 original? please. uninventive. the vampire hunter. the vampires taking over. same old, same old. and if you don't have a story, don't write. a good story be chetwynd-hayes. not so bad by Barker. other than that..... Like to add that i don't hate vampires. i just hate recycling, vampire clans, so-called exciting intrigues, and melodrama 
 Here's the scoop:  The stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added.  That's only part of the problem.  David Sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice.  If you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort.  Then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part.  Amy Sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention.  However, her parts are very small.  I wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem 
 It wasn't worth the money that I payed for. It is a good radio if you have an external antenna. I would play it in the office and could never get a decent signal until I had to pay an extra $30 for an antenna. If you are going to pay $300 plus you should get something that works out of the box. I could have purchased a lesser know brand and recieved better reception then what I got. Overall if you want to end up purchasing more products to make your system work to perfection this is the product for you. There are plenty of products that don't cost as much and deliver everthing this did and more. 
 I am 88. All my life I have loved my English History & the English Countryside. I have travelled in all the old 52 Counties of England & Wales. Against this background I find that Alison Weir has written the best historical Biography & the best History I have ever read. Of the criticised detail; for me,the Topography is a bonus. Overall the detail provides the facts. Most Professional Historians patronise the lay reader by relegating the facts to references or footnotes. Then by a deliberatively cultivated oersonal style they present their interpretaions of the facts as the correct history. Alison Weir allows the reader to make his own interpretation of the facts as well as a judgment on her own interpretation of them. I have not yet even read all the book - as you know its delivery was delayed - but I have read enough to know that each remaining page will continue to give me increasing delight. I end with one of many personal experiences reading this superb book.        "In August 1924 I had a family seaside holiday at Walton on the Naze. One evening there was an adventurous expedition with other families to walk 'Round the Point'. As a child of 6 I remember clearly seeing in the evening sunlight the grassy mound with a few rocks where the castle once stood. No mention was ever made then or later to this being the place where Isabella had spent her first night in England on her return. In fact our families' expedition was a memorable occasion as there were several children for the adults to safeguard & we were nearly cut off by the incoming tide. Now my memory of that shingled shore is enhanced,not by nostalgia,but knowledge. 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 Although I love the original Holmes stories that I read growing up, invariably I am disappointed when I try one of the Holmes stories written by others. Being a fan of mysteries with supernatural overtones, I thought I would try this. But I gave up long before the ghost (or whatever) was introduced -- before they even arrived in Scotland, in fact. Talk, talk, talk, even when there was some action. This has convinced me to reread Doyle's books if I am in the mood for a Sherlock Holmes story, and not try any of the imitators 
 This backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck, it would have been better with metal zipper 
 I had a chance to look this book over, and don't understand what all the fuss is about. There is nothing new here, from cleaning to menu planning, to relationships that hasn't been said better in other books, or even free online, and this book is double-spaced type throughout, so you go through more pages than you should have to finding this out. I hate it when book publishers waste paper like this.  The most annoying part of the book is the constant (every other day's entry) exhortation to go buy the companion workbook to get all the worksheets. If she had printed it in an 8 1/2 by 11" format, AND included the worksheets as templates, it  would be worth the price new, as it is, in a smaller size, hold off and buy it used 
 I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money! 
 After reading about 10 pages of very basic info, the author has 100+ pages of stock charts.  Before each stock takes a dive, the author puts a red arrow and says "short sell here."  what a genius?  I spent a total of 10 minutes with this book.  Very disappointing 
 This movie does not adress art in any way, shape, or form.  Do not be fooled 
 In the process of building a website targeted to those good folks that are striving valiantly to make a living through Internet marketing, you might think that an early objective would be to assemble a library of good reference material. After all, if you are planning on providing sensible information to your readers, then you should have a few good text books on hand to refer to when you need to be sure that some little tidbit of information might actually work. Well, at least I did. So, I have been scouring the Internet for textbook on the subject of Forecasting, which we share a common interest in. I have purchased a few and, for the most part, they are really quite informative and will be useful when the time comes. There is, however, an exception to this.  One book I purchased bears the title "Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, Brockwell, Peter J and Richard A Davis". Being an intelligent sort of chap, I naturally took the word "Introduction" to mean just that. You know, you've been introduced to people before and becoming introduced usually means that 1. You look at the face. 2. You grasp their hand and shake firmly and 3. You exchange pleasantries, such as "Hello, it's nice to meet you".  Now, I never blame the person making the introduction if the relationship doesn't work out. After all, it's not their fault that two people hopefully sharing a common interest (after all, why bother making an introduction?) aren't all that compatible. There are likely to be many reasons for the incompatibility, the first of which could be that people travel in different circles and your circle isn't ever going to be part of their circle. Sort of an exclusionary relationship, you might say. And, not to be overly judgmental of others, of course, there may be plenty of good reasons for that. If everyone existed in one social circle, after all, the world would be beyond boring.  Anyways, the text book is a wonderful creation, that is, if you're a post-graduate or doctoral candidate. Upon opening the cover, expecting to be warmly introduced, I was rather amazed at the depth of equations and formulas gracing practically every page. I felt intimidated immediately. Remember the movie "The Ring"? This had to be rocket science, or more correctly, forecasting science at its most extreme! Wow! I should have really paid more attention during my statistics classes. So, I quickly closed the cover and tried to get a refund from the seller. Note the word Tried here. They didn't want it back either. The good Post-Grand and PhD. candidates of the science of forecasting probably don't need an "Introduction" to Time Series and Forecasting. Next time I buy a book, I think I'll look for something with "Sandbox" in the title.  May all your Forecasts be Good Forecasts at [...] 
 I expected this book to have advice on how to mangage your risk factors after a cardiac event -- What I got was a "self help" book that rambled on about the series of emotions you may experience and how to deal with them. It was a lot of "touchy-feely," without any good solid advice on how to handle the physical situation your body is in. This was exacerbated by a maudlin tone and what I felt were cheesy and poorly written personal anecdotes.   Other books I purchased did a great job at addressing the serious issues of depression, anxiety and stress management while still providing excellent advice and education on medications, health care, exercise, diet, and other "key levers" to maintaining cardiac health after a serious cardiac event. As alternatives to this book, I would highly recommend both "Take a Load Off Your Heart: 109 Things You Can Actually Do to Prevent, Halt and Reverse Heart Disease," and "The Cardiac Recovery Handbook: The Complete Guide to Life After Heart Attack or Heart Surgery."   Hope this is helpful 
 This book has about 3 interesting chapters; the rest is all dialog between a man and wife.  All this chit chat does nothing to further the plot, but simply takes up time and space.  There is no suspense until the 49th chapter.  Take my word for it; this book is not worth the $$, or time to read.  What a waste of talent.  
 Alex Mandossian is a zealot for podcasting. This book is his self promotion vehicle. It sells the idea of doing podcasts for money, which is the author's business. His company is mentioned by name several times per chapter; the co-authors' various other business enterprises also are heavily hyped.   This is a book about what Mandossian calls "monetization" -- that is, getting people to pay for something or become more loyal as a result of podcasting. It is not about how to write, produce, or promote a business podcast.   "The Business Podcasting Bible" appears hastily written, and unedited: the text is verbose, wandering and repetitive, riddled with typos that should not have made it to press. The few nuggets of somewhat helpful info are sparse in these 285 pages that could (and should) have been 100.  The "Private Member Site" is no better. This book was published three months ago, but much of the bonus online material it promises is not there yet. What is online is basically selected book content in mp3 form.   I hope to find a good book that I can recommend on this subject -- a book that is more useful and less tedious to read. 
 This book shows the dichotomy that exists in modern-day America between the cutthroat environment that supposedly exists in the private sector, and the easy-does-it culture fostered within the public sphere of schools, government agencies, etc...  The book makes the case that America's youth are basically coddled K-12, and end up playing catch-up during and after college when working in the free-market culture of the private sector.    These conclusions have been elaborated on before in other publications, and are only true to a certain degree.  For example, the author gives examples of how Americans working in the private sector excel and achieve like citizens of no other country.  The author forgets to mention that nearly all the successful industries in this country, especially those that have gone to spawn copycats in other countries, were and are all supported and protected by government largess.  For example, automobiles would only be rich men's toys today if it were not for all those roads and parking lots built by taxpayers.  Another example, US agriculture would not have survived the Great Depression and become the world's leader in food produce if not for the introduction of farm subsidies, government-funded agricultural research, government-operated satellites and weather stations to monitor the weather, and other government programs that directly or indirectly help farmers.  These and other established, successful private industries would be nowhere without some "coddling" from US taxpayers.  Even if we dismiss the previous points, I believe the author has only shown half the picture; specifically, the author does not fully examine the question of why "coddling" occurs in schools and students are not prepared for the competition of the "real world".  The answer to this question connects the dichotomy so well illustrated by the author.  Specifically, American adults are so busy surviving in the private sector that they have less time and effort to raise their kids to be good competitors themselves.  For example, the character traits that makes for successful businesses: willingness of employees to relocate, works long hours, toeing the company line, etc..., are exactly the worse traits to follow when trying to raise kids well.   Raising kids well means living in stable communities with low turnover - this means minimal relocation of employees by businesses.   Raising kids well means spending time with them, and not spending long hours at work.   Raising kids well means teaching them to stand up for what they believe in, not what their peers (boss, coworkers, etc...) want them to do.    This then is what the author has totally missed out on in this book; an explanation of how the dichotomy between private sphere hard-nosed competetion, and public sphere cushion jobs came about.  Because of this omission, this book is merely commentary and observation, and lacks insightful thought 
 This is the sad story of a divorce and it's aftermath. Jeff Daniels plays another jerk who turns his sons against their mother while seducing one of his female college students. He's the stereotypical egomaniac former successful writer who turns ruthless and hostile after his wife also becomes a successful writer. He can't handle the competition and it turns his madonna/whore complex on high gear. He even fights over custody of the family pet!   If your parents are divorced this may bring back some painful repressed memories. Sadly it's the story of my generation. People with kids should watch this before divorcing. The worst part is the confustion of the boys and the distortion of the facts by their father. 
 What does WILD THINGS 2 have going against it from the get-go: A) No Denise Richards  B) No name actors  C)Being a crappy direct-to-video sequel  D)No Denise Richards NAKED . . .   What is wrong with WILD THINGS 2 after the fact:   A)A script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew  B)ONE sex scene -- A (weak) threesome, one of the few things even linking this to the original C)Sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked (leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot) . . . Wait let me play that again!  If I seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an EROTIC THRILLER.  Did I mention no Denise Richards? 
 No stories, no inside view, no organization, no reason to waste your time with this book.  I was excited when I bought this book and once I started to read it I was wondering when it would become a good read.  It never did.  The author painted a professional bike racer's life as one big bore.  
 I bought the 4600 for my parents in 2005. A seal in the lens housing broke in November and we sent it to Nikon.  When Nikon recieved the camera they said it had "liquid" damage to the lens shutter area. My parents didn't send the camera in that condition, yet Nikon claims that it is "impossible" for that kind of "accident" to occur at their facility. Two months later I am still arguing with them over this. One of their service represatives, Rob Mustard, told me (paraphrasing) "I have 70 service orders in front of me and our facility gets hundreds of repairs each week; I've heard every excuse imaginable for why it isn't the customer's fault." Besides being rude, doesn't that scare you about his facility getting in hundreds of repairs each week???? Don't buy Nikon is my recommendation. 
 I finished this book fairly quickly, and I came away from it feeling like I had a decent overview of the atmosphere in America during 1968, but that I had not learned anything other than the basic facts of what went on.  In  my opinion, Kaiser fails to go in-depth enough into any one subject (except  the McCarthy campaign) to give the reader a true understanding of what it  must have felt like to be there.  I was born in 1982, so I was not there,  and I still feel like I lack an understanding of the attitudes and events  of the time.  Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the title is  misleading.  This book is not about music or the counterculture or really  even  the shaping of a generation.  It is about the presedential campiagn  of 1968, and specifically the McCarthy campaign.  If someone wanted a more  of a cultural account that is specific and goes in depth into the feelings  and conflicting spirits that characterized that turbulent year, I would  recommend they look elsewhere, as I will 
 This is a tract, not a thoughtful piece of scholarship. It is in the Latin American school of angry social science, but is little informed by fact.  Much of what it says is correct, but is also well known.  But the analysis is weak, based on incorrect or outdated data, and simply a regurgitation of stereotypes instead of a deductive grounded analysis based upon good ethnographic work.   It is therefore often simply wrong.  But anger sells books.... 
 If you are church of Christ then you might enjoy this book. If you are not then don't bother.  I was so excited when I saw this book that I had it rushed over night.  Sadly this book is a contradiction to what I believe and know to be truth 
 I run hot and cold with Clint Eastwood. Hot with movies like "Outlaw Josey Wales", and "Dirty Harry". "Unforgiven" ranks right up there with  "Bridges of Madison County" as two of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Sorry fans 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 Any resemblence between what is stated in this book and what's actually going on in the Middle East is purely coincidental.  What the reader gets instead is some amazing fascist propaganda that won't truly serve anyone.    Hirst writes for the Guardian, a rather famous British newspaper that took decades to establish a fine reputation for its journalism.  It is staggering to realize just how much damage the Guardian has done to this reputation in just a short while by permitting such nonsense to invade its pages.  And I think we need to ask ourselves how and why this has happened.  The staff of the Guardian has to be professional.  One would think that they would hesitate to destroy their paper in such a manner.  After all, it would cost the paper money.  It might ruin the paper entirely, and put them out of jobs.  One might suppose it unlikely that they would want to violate any semblence of good journalistic practice just to hurt a few Jews or Israelis.  However, the experience of reading this book and seeing some of the reviews has led me to a hypothesis of what has happened.  The destruction of the Guardian's reputation as a conduit of good journalism has not put it out of business at all.  Just as this book has brought money to its author, the ghastly articles in the Guardian bring money to the newspaper, if only by appearing sensational and controversial.    I think we readers have a duty to try to reverse this trend.  Just as dedicated people have made great progress in the campaign against cigarette smoking, the same can be done in the campaign against bad journalism.  We can warn our friends about books such as this one.  And we ought to do just that 
 I did not enjoy this book as much as many of the other phantom stories that I have read.  I try to read anything on the phanom, but this one was hard to get emotionally involved in.  It jumped around so much that you were always being jerked to the next spot before you really got involved in where you already were.  Although you could follow what was going on it just did not flesh out each situation enough to really get you involved and it felt somewhat cold to me.  I will keep my copy just because have have to have everything phantom 
 I have to be honest I only watched the first ten minutes of this hunk of junk.  I ussually will soldier through a movie if I have put my money into it, but I could not watch this.  It's the first movie I've ever seen that truly does blow harder than water shooting out of a whales blow hole 
 This poorly researched book of straight up fabrications and quotes taken out of context has one thing right, some radical 60's leftists are trying to take over America, namely David Horowitz (former left-wing radical and Black Panther) and his band of 'former' socialists turned neos.  David doesn't even write this dribble, he just puts his name on it and hits the television machine and air waves.  If you've heard David talk about his book then you've heard all the best parts.  Media Matters ripped this book apart for its butchering of quotes by the likes of George Soros to state an arguement that could not exist without pure editorial manipulation.  It's been over a month and David has promised a 'full-blown' rebuttal to Media Matters findings but so far he's been unable to stretch the truth any further.    Wake up sheeple, David and Poe are coming for your children 
 I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse. It arrived and I immediately saw a defect,in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly, even with major force. I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them. I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me. Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter's organization but without any success. I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and, in particular, the after sales service.

 The video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out. The tools are not explained and there isn't as much to do with it as they imply. May be nice for birthday party editing, i don't know. I didn't like it. It's not worth $100. The other capabilities might be nice,but from what i've dealt with, that's not the case 
 Laminated maps such as this one of DC (where I live) are insufficient.  Get the big-sized paper map in a book store or you will wish you had.  The one here lacks details north of Adams Morgan's central district, for example 
 This book is filled with so many implausibilities and plot holes that it hardly works as an espionage thriller. Even though Trevanian provides heavyhanded clues throughout the narration that the book is intended as a parody, I am unwilling to grant him such a silly cop-out. The story basically pits a conspiratorial corporate megalith against a resourceful assassin. Although the assassin has Western lineage, he grows up in China and Japan, and is informally educated in Eastern mysticism. Unfortunately, this back story is lengthy and overwrought, and hardly describes how this son of a high-class whore develops such a pathological indifference to human life. We only learn that he has the ability to enter a trancelike state of Shibumi, in which he experiences some kind of metaphysical bliss, but loses that ability after murdering his surrogate father, a Japanese general on trial for war crimes during World War II, and being beaten in prison. While in prison, he develops some kind of psychic power to detect people's moods and proximity, although that ability is not worth mentioning, because it never advances the plot. The assassin also is an expert at sex; again, who but the most sexually squeamish adolescent would care? If the backstory were not tedious enough, Trevanian inflicts readers with a lengthy, self-indulgent chapter about exploring a cave that does nothing to advance the plot.  The plot finally begins to advance in the last 50 pages of the book, and basically amounts to a tale of revenge. Unfortunately, there are a zillion loose ends. The all-powerful corporate bad guy, Mr. Diamond, wants revenge on the assassin, Nicholai Hel, for killing his brother (the brother had tortured Hel in prison). So, why didn't Diamond seek revenge years ago?  Did he really need the pretense of Hel's involvement in an attempt to thwart a terrorist hijacking? Also, why did Hel have to try to thwart the hijacking, when the British government, fearing an embarassment that Hel threatens, ends up killing all the witnesses on board the plane and crashing it into the ocean? Finally, Hel appears motivated only to get involved in thwarting the hijacking to repay an old acquaintance and to save the whales. The characters are equally thin. Bad guy Mr. Diamond is crudely drawn and is an easy target for hackneyed, anti-Western, anticapitalist ridicule. "Good guy" Hel is a haughty, self-absorbed misogynist with a nearly delusional sense of Japanese history that conveniently ignores that country's long list of atrocities, particularly in World War II. All the women characters are described in terms of their abilities to please chauvinistic men. The descriptions of Arab characters demonstrate Trevanian's bigotry. Hel's friend, a cartoonishly self-righteous Basque, LeCagot, provides comic relief, and is the only likable character in the book. Instead of developing the plot or the characters, Trevanian treats the reader to rants about Western society, Arabs, New York City, U.S. college students, French people, the British, the CIA, oil companies, and almost everything else not bearing the imprint, "Made in Japan." They are all easy targets, but the sign of a talented storyteller is the ability to provide these targets with some character and humanity before knocking them down. Find something else to read 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon) 
 I have to agree with the reviewer named jrubi02 on this novel. I too am a fan of historical mysteries, and this work, while not without promise, was disappointing. As the other reviewer noted, the catapulting of the main character from a rural servant to being at the center of Tudor intrigue in no time is just too hard to believe. I couldn't get past that basic premise. Additionally, the brazen attitude the main character uses to win the confidence of both future Tudor queens is hackneyed, as is the romantic plot thread.   The author does a nice job of portraying the historical period and is apparently learned in the history of the time. Morevoer, his enthusiasm for his subject is obvious. However, as much as I enjoy the historical characters portrayed in the book, I lost patience with it and didn't finish it. I know the author frequents these Amazon pages, and I hope he will take my critique in the spirit in which it is offered 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 This book is mostly built around the idea "I wish it were true = it *is* true".  While this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives, if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life (i.e. intellectual integrity), you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability 
 There really was good bits to this book.  Unfortunately, her accusation against Bible translators as being male and therefore biased against passages that dealt with women seemed terribly harsh if not arrogant.  The basic line of reason goes as follows: "All Bible translators are bigots and have gotten this passage wrong. 'Authority' in the this Biblical passage really doesn't mean 'authority'in the greek."  What does it mean?  Hubcap 
 This book falls short of the reported credentials writing it.  Boxing is an activity greatly influenced by individual genetics and up-bringing, and it's essence becomes watered down with academic renderings such as this.  The two best books written on the "How-To" of Boxing:  CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTING by Jack Dempsey and BOXING: A SELF-INSTRUCTION MANUAL destroy this reviewed book's contents, hands down.  I cannot give any book that promotes itself as the ultimate in anything any more than a mediocre glimpse.  Such egotism already confirms its gross lacking 
 Not very well known, but one of the most important artists in his styl 
 Poorly illustrated explanations leading to confused understanding.I am doing this right or not...Who knows.Ended up consigning this book to the basement 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 Uh, I'm not sure I agree a hundred percent with your detective work, there, Greil.   If he truly wanted to present and comprehensive view of what his subtitle purports, that is, American myths archetypes and how they inform and are presented by Rock and Roll, why is the scope of this book so narrow? The artists he focuses on are a motley crew. Elvis, Robert Johnson sure- but Randy Newman? The Band, but not Dylan? Harmonica Frank, but no Chuck Berry? Berry's oeuvre itself is a perfect microcosm of 20th century American Mythos. Speaking of myth, why is Pilgram's Progress invoked as a metaphor for The Band, but Faust isn't referenced at all in the Robert Johnson chapter. America is nothing if not Faustian. This book is 40 percent Rock-Geek trivia, and 60 percent pure ponderous speculation. Marcus occasionally drifts into a fugue and wanders far away from his (musical) subject, several times in the Elvis section whereupon he suddenly remembers what he was supposed to be writing about and tries vainly to shoehorn all of his speculations together. I think Marcus is a fine writer (we would not entertain his notions for a second if he wasn't), and this book certainly has its moments, but on the whole it does not nearly live up to its hype. He has done better, in The Old, Weird America, dealing with the same themes and sticking to one musical subject (Dylan's Basement Tapes). 
 Maybe this book had some good information in it during the early 90's when all of this stuff was new but now this book doesn't offer anything to anyone. All of the technical stuff is very old and the focus is on very simple stuff like HTML page directories and images while, the team structure chapters are conflicting seem to be written by someone who doesn't really understand the development process, and the project scenarios have little to no value 
 People who did this atlas wanted to cut their job and limited the Eastern Europe by deviding it by two parts. One and very big part of the Eastern Europe is not in the Historical Atlas. The biggest European countries such as Ukraine and Russia as well as other countries - Baltic states, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, etc. are not concidered to be Europe in so called Historical Atlas of the Eastern Europe. I would reccomend the authors to get some geography lessons before making any other job.. 
 Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking.  This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.  Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.    The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias.   
 This book is about a girl.  She is 13.  She is going to America  She likes a boy named Lou.  she learns to sew.  she is pretty.  She has a grandmother. she is nice. she is cool 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was not what I expected and I was bored 95% of the time 
 This is a book that could (should?) have faded into history without being a great loss to the world. Yes, there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy, but they're far and few between, and mainly either just thrown out as Montesquieu's personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination, or flimsily based on historical examples. As a reader, I didn't find most of his arguments (where he didn't seem to be contradicting himself, which happens frequently) very convincing. This was obviously written with the 18th century French salon crowd in mind, and reads as such. I'm sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time, but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history.  He claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal; well, I did read the whole book and at the end couldn't see an overarching structure at all. The work just seemed like a long, rambling, unorganized mess. The only people I might really recommend this to are people interested in Greek, Roman, and French history (especially legal history), but not to people interested in political science or philosophy.  Bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought, there are much more interesting reads out there 
 The filters that I got are poorly finished.  The 812 filter has a smudge on it, while all 3 filters don't screw on properly on my lens.  All filters come off EASILY.  They are totally useless.  I suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens 
 Recently bought a spindle of a 50 pack of Sony DVD+R and all had errors.  I noticed other reviewers are using DVD Identifier to see the real manufacture of black disks.  I downloaded DVD Identifier and scanned a Sony DVD+R 16x and what came up was (Sony Recording Media Co.)  These blank disks are terrible, all the disks had errors and half way through the burn process would produce errors, stay away from these blank disks.  I recommend Fuji disks whick scanned through DVD Identifier is (Taiyo Yuden Co. Ltd.) and burn excellent and Verbatim disks whick scanned through DVD Identifier is (Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.) and these too burn excellently.  Hope all this helps 
 Hilary duff (in my book)  really should learn to fly with the mob she'll have after her with this DVD!  My advice, forget it!  With her voice she'll soon fly right out of the American spotlight.  She really shouldn't be there now!  Fly is the worst song on this cd.  For some reason it made me think of this comic strip i saw with this guy in a restaraunt.  the waiter fell in his soup and the dude said "Waiter i believe your fly is in my soup."  a rather sick joke.  No offense to crazy Hilary Duff fans.  
 We purchased a DeLonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired. We barely used this product. When contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us. My $20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years! This is the lsat time I buy a toaster based on appearance 
 I'd be okay with a story that had 1 or 2 last-second escapes, but this book has at least 10, if not more!  I think the author spent too much time watching action films and incorporated every single escape trick into one book.  Even a Bond film would not go this far out on a limb.  They only other Reilly book I've read is The Contest, which I suppose was just as far fetched, but I give that one more latitude since it was science fiction and this one is not.  Another complaint is that a 16th century manuscript is woven into the story - which is not a bad idea - but there was no effort at all to change the language to the appropriate era.  The book does have a lot of action though... so if you like wild adventure and can completely suspend reality, you'd probably enjoy.  Appropriateness:  I would like to have recommended this as a fun action book for teens, but be aware that it contains a lot of language and a lot of violence.  There are many gruesome deaths of all varieties.  There is no sexual content or discussion of it 
 I must admit. I am not Kings biggest fan. I like the way he writes characters, but for years, I haven't been able to put my finger on why I don't like his books. After reading The Colorado Kid, I realized what it was. King is a lazy writer. He can tell a good story, but he doesn't follow through. His typical way out of a jamb is to make some inanimate object talk. Bleh. You can tell when he is done with a story. It just ends.  This book is no exception. The story rambles through the mouth of a clichï¿½d old time reporter teaching a young'un the ropes. King tells the story, he doesn't show it. I kept waiting for the narrative to stop and for the action to begin, but it never did.  And the ending! Someone, his editor, agent, family or friends, tell Mr. King that mysteries are supposed to be resolved. He doesn't resolve this mystery. That was the only reason, other than the fact that I had a 7 hour flight and nothing else to do, that kept me reading. I got to the end and I swear I almost tossed the book while on the plane. There is an after word trying to justify his ending. I didn't get past the first sentence. Authors don't write justifications for their books unless they know they are guilty of something.  If I could take away all the stars on this book, I would. Even one star is one too many. 
 I purchased this headset to wear to the gym to tune into their TV's to watch programs rather than listen to music.  Reception was horrible!!!  While I was in the gym I tried just listening to the radio and couldn't even get that to come in clear.  The only time it was partially clear was if you were standing outside and it was clear skies!  Not impressed at all!  I will be returning this and maybe buy the $12 generic set instead 
 No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal John Dewey and his "experimental school." Who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of "progressivism?" I would.  Dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. This he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The problems in Dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further disguise and exacerbate low performance?  School and Society, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. Nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their "natural inquisitiveness" programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, Tennessee Williams, and the "plus-que-parfait" tense. But of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.  90% of students in high schools today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. The School and Society relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one 
 I didn't watch Millenium when it was on ten years ago, so I thought I'd give it a try on DVD, as I'm a big X-files fan. I watched two shows: "The Beginning and the End" and "The Dogs". They were ridiculous AND boring. I'm done with Millenium 
 I am stunned that a book like "Lightning" would sell even one copy.  Mine was given to me, but should have been tossed in the trash instead.  I cannot begin to talk about what is wrong with this book because there is nothing right. Worthless!!!!and pathetic and beyond.  For heaven sake if you are really of fan of Steel's (I find that hard to believe) than check it out of the library, do not waste a dime on this trash. "Lightning" discredits all women and is a sham.  It does not deserve even one star 
 There are SOOOO many GREAT books about wiccan and witchcraft out there I certainly wouldn't waste my money again on this book, and I suggest others don't either. I am a solitary practioner for 6 years and have been studying wiccan for 10 and when I picked up this book I thought it was very cheesy. Most books put things in simple, pleasant terms without all the false, goofy information spread thoughout this book. It is a lot of pop propaganda made to make wicca and witchcraft look like something out of the movies. This book reads like it walked right out the tv show charmed. This book is not for anyone who is seriously interested in learning the truth about wicca, or witchcraft in general (an YES they are 2 totally different things even though you wouldn't know that by reading her book.) This book is not about a different of opinions or different practices, it is about portraying a real, serious, religion as a fun and games, do whatever you want choice. Even though I am not in a coven I understand wicca is a religious choice and like any religion there are beliefs and redes which are followed. It is not 'do whatever you want to do and call yourself wiccan'. Just as you cannot worship a rock and call yourself buhdist you cannot just do whatever you want and call yourself wiccan. Yes some things in religion are personal choices (like choosing ot be a vegetarian or not) but the building blocks if the religion are totally lost on her. Freedom of choice in religion is wonderful and its everyones right but if your choice is to make up your own religion you should not go around saying your wiccan when you do not follow the wiccan ways, Unfortunatly that is EXACTLY what ravenwolf does. If she focused this book as a "paan" book then it I would almost be able to pass it off as sutible, however she teaches little-no FACTUAL history on wicca or witchcraft, she portrays a lot of hate and unacceptance to tohers and basically fails to educate like a book of this standing should. She uses materials in this book that are not actual things you would use in spells but commercial, cutesy items to make everything pretty and oh so shiny. She doesn't go into the reason spells work and how to get your own to work for you (if she did she would have to defend why some of the items she sugests fit in there) She doesn't focus on ways to get closer to nature, to focus or to improve your magic. She does however make the reader feel like they can just read a spell right out of the book and everything will work with a puff of smoke...unfortunatly that is not how wicca or witchcraft work and this book is teaching hype not truths. This book is demeaning and disrespectful to anyone into witchcraft and wicca alike, skip it and pick up a book by a different author, you'll be glad you did 
   A trouble some pooch who has reaccuring dreams of being something else, something far greater.... A man. After a series of silly events he begins to take these dreams seriously and goes off on an adventure to find his family and his old life before..... HE DIED.   While the story is very touching and has a very good moral too it it was far too too long for me and seemed kinda cheesy at some pionts they kept on reinfasizing reincarnation, reincarnation, reincarnation. It was interesting but at one piont it became very boring and I lost intrest. I have only been able to sit through it one time, because of this. It jusy seemed like the man was really in a coma and that at one piont that he was gonna wake up from this long boring nightmare but he never did.   A great move to show small children at bed time so they fall asleep and perhaps people with a long patience or perhaps people with  an intrest in animals and dogs would like to see it 
  BOSE Cinemate Experience First of all, I have never purchased a Bose product in my life (lets just say that I always felt that Bose products are overpriced). Well, we just moved to a new house and I am about 80% done with completing a media/office room in my basement for my main home theater (Samsung 56" DLP, Onkyo 700 series receiver, Polk and RBH speakers).  In the meantime we are watching a 32" LCD TV (Polaroid 3232) in our living room. When I bought the Polaroid (for a ridiculously low price), I knew it had a few expected shortcomings. The major shortcoming is the horrible sound from the internal speakers (think clock radio sound)..  So, on somewhat of a whim (I did a little research here and CC) I picked up a Bose Cinemate system for $499 (+ tax). I liked the Bose for its small form factor, clean look, and sound. Let me mention that my wife is totally against having large speakers in the room (that is what the basement is for) and our 20'+ vaulted ceilings really make it tough to have any type of large sound. My wife does not want speaker wire running everywhere, and is against having 5+ speakers in the room. I really thought the Bose would do the trick..  PROS: - Great form factor and size - Very easy setup - Good sound when watching DVD's and cranking the volume   CONS: - No digital or component hookups (only RCA)! - No ability to control individual sound settings (treble, bass, etc) - Lack of depth at low and mid ranges - Little to no bass through the subwoofer unless the TV volume is cranked up - DVD's sounded good when the volume was cranked, but there was little improvement to listening to the TV at normal volume settings.    Contrary to what Bose claims, we had a hard time hearing dialogue during TV shows, and kept missing conversations when characters talked low or whispered.  The lack of digital inputs should have been a warning sign and the "subwoofer" is anything but unless you have the volume cranked.  I was really disappointed with the sound at normal volume levels. As a test I hooked up my HK computer speakers ($50 speakers) directly to my TV and the sound quality was only slightly worse than the Bose (which cost over $450 more!) Needless to say I packed up and returned the Bose system for a full refund.  Based on my budget I decided to go with: - Onkyo TXSR304 5.1 receiver - Polk Audio M10 bookshelf speakers - Sony WMA250 100watt powered 8" subwoofer  I hooked that system up last night and it completely blows the Bose away.    The Polk speakers coupled with the subwoofer have a very clean crisp sound and have much more overall depth and range.  We no longer have to crank the volume to hear dialogue and there is much more bass..  In the process of getting a better system, I saved about $150.... My advice is to shop around.  You can do much better for $500.  
 I bought this book with the expectation that it would be another "Mists". Unfortunately, I was quite mistaken. I found this book to be so boring that I didn't even make it through the whole thing--I kept putting it down and picking it up a few weeks later thinking I would eventually finish it, but I never did. For one, Helena may start off as a strong character, but once her husband and son enter the picture, she becomes content to just sit back and watch all of the excitement happen to them. I found it odd that a woman with such intellect and education would quietly retire to her country house, only kept informed by letters and the once-every-few-years visit of her son. I'd recommend not reading this one. Read "The Mists of Avalon" again instead 
 We purchased this book to use in our accelerated curriculum since we have a substantial vocabulary unit connected to Frankenstein.  However, a few days into the book, we are noticing major departures from Mary Shelley's novel.  Kaplan has irresponsibly marketed this book as if it is the original version.  
 I bought this book because it seemed funny and what I needed to bring my spirit up.  It ended bringing me down even more!  When you read it, it looks like a someone trying to get even at all those people that havent had this problem.  It gives unworthy advise that only help you feel resented.  For example, it says that if a friend of yours tells you she is pregnant what you should do is tell her that you had noticed that she was fat and had chubby ankles!  I really do not recommend it 
 This book with its poor selection of no names who offer their limited or non-existent wisdom on Welty should have never been published. It is further proof of the poor quality of USC Press Books these days 
 I tried to watch this dvd, but after about 10 minutes gave up.  It was impossible to watch because only bits of the conversations between the characters were translated.  I've seen some poorly subtitled foreign films, but this was by far the worst.  Don't bother until a dvd with decent subtitles is released 
 I have had a horrible experience with this toy. The email that I sent to the company, which follows, explains it well. Because it is a long email I will sum it up (for those who don't have the time to read such a lengthy review) by saying that the quality of this product is amongst the lowest I have ever encountered with any consumer product. Many pieces do not fit well together, other are too tight, one piece does not work, and another piece was intentionally made to not operate correctly. I had enjoyed Capsela as a child, which was a wonderful and high quality toy back then, but now I have been utterly disheartened by the garbage that is now manufactured as Capsela.  Dear Educational Insights:   There are moments in my childhood that will remain forever blissful. The reminiscence of playing with Capsela ranks as one of my all time favorites. I played with and enjoyed Capsela for many years as a child starting with the 500 set. Later on, I got the 5000 set, and then I finally got the 1000 set.   I do not know what happened to my 500 or 5000 sets, but I still had the 1000 set when I got older. About five years ago, I accidentally left it behind when I moved. I have a daughter who is now eight-years-old, and I decided to purchase the 1000 set so that she and I can enjoy a wonderful way for her to learn about science: through the timeless play of Capsela.   I am appalled at what sits in front of me. I am so disappointed that I actually feel nauseous. The quality of this toy is utterly horrific. This horrible experience started with the motor capsule. The connection to the output of the motor is unbelievable loose; the toy falls apart during operation. It is so loose that the lightest piece, a coupler, connected with an Octagonal Connector will fall right off the motor capsule. I thought that perhaps this was a fluke, and I was originally going to contact you to see if I could exchange this poor part with a better one. Upon playing with more of the parts, it was obvious that this was no fluke; almost all the piece were spectacularly bad. I played with about half of the parts, and here is a list of problems that I found:   --There are connections which are so loose amongst many of the capsules and other connecting parts that the capsules and parts disconnect during normal play.   --There are connections which are so tight on some capsules and other connecting parts that it would be impossible for an eight-year-child to disassemble. (I hurt my fingers disconnecting some of these tight parts myself.)   --There was an Octagonal Connector connecting two Transmission Capsules together, an Octagonal Connector connecting two Capsules (empty) together, and an Octagonal Connector connected to a single Capsule. I actually remember my first 1000 set having these connections when I first opened it. I surmise that this is done during packaging so that these capsules, which can be separated into two halves, stay assembled during storage. The problem is that the Octagonal Connector on the single Capsule cannot be removed. I did not try to use any tools to remove it because I suppose it is possible that union is intentionally permanent. It should not be a permanent connection, and the Octagonal Connector should be able to be removed.   --One of the Crown Wheel Capsules does not work: the gears do not mesh properly. The reason for this has to do with the next problem.   --The Speed Reduction Capsule, the Worm Gear Capsule, the Crown Wheel Capsules, the Internal Gear Capsule, and the Clutch Capsule all have an internal piece that supports some of the gear shafts. These support pieces are loosely fitted in each capsule which causes a lot of vibration (the gear shafts are not stable because of it) and an excess amount of noise. The problems of vibration and noise are very bad in the Worm Gear Capsule; it is so bad that the noise is almost intolerable.   --Some of the Chain pieces do not connect tightly. As a result, these loose pieces disconnect during operation, and the chain falls off the Gear Wheels. (The Chain and Gear Wheels used to be my favorite part of this toy.)   --The Capsules (empty) can be separated into two halves. These two halves fit together, but not so well. When only one side of these capsules is connected, the opposite end is slightly ajar due to imperfect alignment. This really is not an operational problem as much as it is an aesthetic problem. There are a few projects where a Capsule has only one connection, and the ajar end makes it look ugly.   --There has been a design change in the wires and the way that they connect to the parts which receive these connections. At first glance, it did seem like an improvement. The connecting ends of the wires are now shrouded. These plastic shrouds have a tooth which fits into a notch in either the Motor Capsule, the Rotary Switch Capsule, or the Switch Box. The teeth on the shrouds of the red wires are not big enough, and as such, the teeth do not fit into the notches which means the wires do not have to line up when making the connections. This is not a problem since the wire does not actually need to be connected a certain way, but it is another low quality attribute of this experience.   --Although not a problem, I disapprove that the battery cases are now fastened with screws. This does not make for easy exchange of the batteries (as infrequent as it may be).   --It may be trivial, but the cardboard separators inside the box are flimsy, and do a lousy job at organizing the pieces. The original foam packaging was much better.   --This final problem is the one which prompted me to actually contact you about all of these problems. The Rotary Switch Capsule does not work. The reason it does not work is not because of some horrible manufacturing. It does not work because there is a wire inside the capsule that connects the electrical connectors on both ends of the capsule together! This is unbelievable! This totally defeats the purpose of the Rotary Switch Capsule. Even to a person who has not had any sort of analog electronics experience can plainly see through this transparent capsule that this wire provides an uninterrupted current. The whole point of this capsule IS to interrupt the current as it spins so as to create a blinking light. Why, OMG, please answer me why, is there a wire on the inside of this capsule that allows the current to pass right along? I have had a course in analog electronics, and this connection makes no sense. You have totally ruined this capsule with this connection. Why have you done this?   I know that Educational Insights was not the original owner of Capsela. It is apparent that your purchase of the Capsela name was only for monetary gain. You do not care about the quality of the product you brand nor the scientific, learning experience which this toy can provide. You have grossly ruined a wonderful toy. Now instead of my daughter learning about science through educational play, she gains "educational insights" into the substandard commercialism caused by the corporate world of greed 
 The story had potential - a Pygmalion-like transformation story - but fell flat on its face with repetitive, immature writing, flat characters for whom you feel no empathy, and a lack of detail in settings and places.  Don't waste your time - you can get something similar in The Nanny Diaries or The Devil Wears Prada 
 What I don't like about these is the way you have to position them in the cradle to make sure they charge.  I bought these for my elderly father and he's having a hard time positioning them correctly - and if they're not positioned correctly they won't charge 
 I found htis book disgusting and it literally made me physically ill with all of the sexual remrks, this book is built on sex and nthing else and i found the parts with Leyna Shaw particulary disturbing, also the fact that roger was a sexually starved pathetic hman, after he had intercourse for the first time he was only excited about the fact that he had found another way to stimulate himself!  I found this gross and completely inapropriate the only way to make this book better would be to burn it 
 I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!   Unsatisfied customer 
 I'm afraid this book has very little to recommend it. Not only is it out of touch with classical and contemporary literature on its subject of choice, all the master structures described aren't really plot structures either, but rather smaller narrative "motifs". And where are all the illustrative, helpful examples from literature and film to flesh out the descriptions? Probably in some other book.  For a well-researched, expansive, and empirically grounded take on basic plot structures, I recommend Christopher Booker's "The Seven Basic Plots" 
 There's not much to say about Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave other than it's actually worse than the movie before it. Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis was really bad and not in the so bad it's funny. What had been a cult horror franchise which had fun with the zombie genre in addition to putting some genuine scares in people, these last two Return of the Living Dead movies should pretty much kill the franchise just when the zombie revival is still going on strong.  Ellory Elkayem does directing duty for this fifth installment. He also directed the fourth film. I had thought that not everything should be laid at Elkayem's feet when it came to who to blame for the lackluster and awful film that was Necropolis, but after sitting through Rave to the Grave I have to say that whatever good will Ellory Elkayem built up with his funny take on the giant creature feature, Eight-Legged Freaks, has been wasted with his back-to-back filming of Return of the Living Dead 4 and 5. Elkayem films both films one after the other and I am going to assume this was more to save on the budget than any sort of continuity with the actors hired to play recurring roles. If saving money was the main reason then it sure didn't look like it. Except for a few hero-zombie (zombies given more screentime than most thus given a better make-up effect) scenes the film clearly shows it's ultra low-budget pedrigree. I don't have problems with low-budget horror movies as long as there's a sense of energy and enjoyment by those making it, but neither Necropolis and Rave to the Grave showed any one of the two.  Rave to the Grave occurs one year after the events of Necropolis and the teenage survivors of that film have now graduated and attending college. The film never really makes it clear if they're in back in the U.S. attending college or still in Eastern Europe where the previous film was set. Either way the survivors from the previous film seem to have moved on quite well from their horrific experiences in Necropolis. The fact that they don't seem to recognize the newly found containment barrel marked with the label of 2-4-5 Trioxin just adds to the weird and hge plot hole between film four and five. One would think that these kids would have it etched forver in their minds that containment barrel with 2-4-5- Trioxin equals horror. Instead they naively investigate and research the barrel with one of their friends realizing he could turn the chemical leaking from the barrel into a new form of rave drug whose extreme hallucinogenic effects also hide a side-effect which basically turns anyone who partakes of the drug into a zombie.  The rest of the movie deals with the survivors finally realizing the crisis they've unleashed and instead of calling for police or military help decide to go to the same outdoor rave party where everyone is taking the drug to try and find the person who made the drug Z and stop him from taking them. Like I said earlier the movie really has major plot holes and most of the time doesn't make much sense. What we get in the end is an excuse to have a huge set piece where the survivors get to shoot as many zombies as possible while at the same time allow for the random raver to suddenly become a zombie out of the blue. There's also a subplot of a couple of bumbling Men-in-Black type agents whose job it is to recover the Trioxin barrel while remaining inconspicuous. The secret organization they belong to must be global since I could barely understand their lines with the heavy Russian accent used by both "actors".  My disappointment in what could've been a nice follow-up to the first three Return of the Living Dead movies was compounded by the sheer Z-movie level of Rave to the Grave after the awful work that was Necropolis. For those wanting to see a good b-level zombie movie that's bad but enjoyable at the same time should check out House of the Dead 2. Yes, the sequel to Uwe Boll's rancid and awful House of the Dead ended up being better than the original and way more entertaining than Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave. I wouldn't even accept this film as a free dvd if someone gave it to me 
 I'm a busy manager and if I had the time to sift through this book I'd get the information for free online - shame on the authors and publisher. Overpriced 
 These are adorable pumps, it's too bad I couldn't even put my foot down to walk in them. The heel is much too long 
 Is this a book to help out women who suffer from being misinformed about menopause or an advertisement for progesterone cream?  Didn't help me at all, if anyone wants to buy it, it's yours but I don't recommend it 
 When the Shaggy Man asked the Scoodlers why they still wanted to eat him after they had just proclaimed their love for him, their answer was simple: "We love you in soup!"  Can someone -- anyone -- take a private interpretation of a word or phrase and then pawn it off to the public at large who will have a quite different understanding of what it means?  An MIT linguist should know that to twist a word or phrase ("failed state") into a private interpretation is lose intellectual coherency.  Understanding, if at all, comes not from the exposition itself but rather from interpretation of the words by the reader (e.g., the kind of understanding one gets from reading "Finnigan's Wake").  And such interpretations vary wildly among readers and are of no use to advancing a general understanding.  If you, as a typical left-wing anti-American, were to say to someone not so inclined that the U.S. is a "failed state," you will draw either a blank stare or laughter.  And either response is entirely appropriate.  However, Chomsky does not really emphasize the "failed state" meme.  It's used more a rhetorical flourish, much like his designation of the U.S. as a "rogue state."  No, the book's theme is that the U.S. is a bumbling, hypocritical, hegemonic power, constantly screwing up others' lives and getting burned from unintended consequences.  There is some small amount of truth in that unoriginal analysis, but Noam's anti-Americanism goes over the top.  There is no bad thing that's happened in the world, it seems, that the United States is not responsible for, including, of all things, the genocide in East Timor.  It's the failure to provide and discuss countervailing evidence or do a rational comparative analysis that turns the book into a screed 
 Reading the reviews on Amazon.com about "The Third Eye" I wonder if many of them were written by the same person.  I am suspicious.  "The Third Eye" is mildly entertaining, but if it is not true, then it does affect my perception of it.  I am sorry.  I could have written as good a book, since I have read lots about Tibet, but not been there in this body.  The theology chapter "Tibetan Beliefs" is patently ludicrous.  I know enough about Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhism, to spot this as a quaint concoction by a Christian (or formerly Christian) Westerner.  I was also offended by the forceful assertion that there *IS* a GOD (italics his), and that it doesn't matter what we call Him.  God is a fact.  Smells pretty fishy to me.  Then he "explains" what Om Mani Padme Hum means.   "Hail to Man's Overself!"  WHAAAATT???  Is that Nietzsche or who?    I was not impressed by the advice in the book on how to relax.  Imagine falling off a cliff and laying there all sprawled and lack-jawed from your SPLAT onto the Earth.  Come on!    This is pure fiction and not even good fiction 
 I am sorry to say this book is a great disappointment compared to the other very good books in the series.  The author comes across as arrogant instead of informed.  The illustrations are not as useful as they could be, not of much introductory help for the residents or deeper reference for those in practice. Pablo Ros book (CT and MRI of Abdomen) is much better, if you can find a copy. 
 I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies.   There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that.   So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list. 
 The problem with being self-righteous is that, in time, people discover you're hypocrite. Way to cheat on your wife Bill. Now, go after someone who doesn't exercise your idea of family values 
 Come on! Nobody who watches this cares about Destiny's Child music!!! If you wanna have them mess up a "Christmas" movie, make them sing a 20 minute video in Frosty Returns. I'm not buyin' if this dvd has 'em playin' 
 I LOVE Christmas.  I love the festive atmosphere.  I love the spirit of giving and I love Christmas music.  This stuff, however, is downright painful to listen to.  A few tracks, with the slower tempo, can be tolerated in small doses, but the more "upbeat" number are too awash in synthesizer arrangements and come across as little more than "a disco Christmas" and severely test my love for the music of the season.  Destined for shopping mall PA systems everywhere 
 this book in short, did not meet my expectations. I thought it would have much better pictures of the beautiful costumes. you think of this beautiful movie and how much of M.A's life was centered around clothing. I was expecting close-ups of the amazing craftsmanship on the costumes, and sketches (which there are none). instead, I was deliverd Kirstin Dunst's high school year book, with tiny, grainy pictures of her big powdered hair. 
 Fake gansta is right, he may sell more albums than lil romeo but aleast lil romeo is real and knows not to disrepect an icon. Am a mega huge Will Smith fan. Bow wow needs to go down some doggy biscuit 
 The essays in this book aren't particularly enlightening; however, they are often misused not to start debate or critical thinking, but rather to show students "what they SHOULD learn and feel about the topics."  I didn't like any of the essays in this book because they didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.  I am already the product of a democratic, public education.  Thus, I am tolerant and accepting of others' views and opinions.  I don't need tolerance beaten into me over the course of a semester.  This book should only be used for the formerly home-schooled and religious right, as it will only open worlds for them.  In sum, this book is best used for what I can only assume it was originally intended - as a yule log.  My fondest memories of this book were in the burning of it after Christmas dinner in 1999.  Book burning is one human right not mentioned in any of the essays in this book - perhaps it should be 
 My husband bought this as a gift since we dont have a whirpool tub.  I thought it was a great gift until i used it.  The mat doesnt stay in place, the bubbles cool off the water (its supposed to heat) and the worst is it is SO LOUD! its like running a hairdryer or vacuum.  I couldn't even hear my husband when he came to the bathroom door!  How are you supposed to relax with all that noise 
 Geez, maybe I have a heart of stone. I wasn't a bit moved by the overrated Streep and handsome Clint. It's a story about two hearts linked as one - a sacrifice by a beautiful woman for the greater good - a touching story of common adultery committed by two randy, bored adults. Yawwwwn. Streep can do any accent on the planet, and sprinkle it with more affected mannerisms than Marcel Marceau. That doesn't make her an actress - just a clever chameleon. I'd rather watch Julia Roberts play herself over and over and over than see Streep play "pretend" roles. There, I've said it. Now goodnight. 
 This is a review of the second edition of the book.  I am an experienced web programmer who was looking to get more acquainted with the layout and design aspects of working with HTML.  Designers I've worked with have always allowed me to be abstracted from that side somewhat, but I wanted to get my hands dirty.    I feel this book presented a lot of useful information, but it was very frustrating to get through due to all the mistakes in the code, typos, and missing graphics.  Since it's an O'Reilly book, I expected this to be the finest book available for CSS.  Unfortunately, it's far from it.  It's painful to get through certain sections, notably chapter 7, which has graphics from other chapters randomly thrown into it.  The mistakes start right on page 3 and don't stop until the end.  Clearly, this was a book they hurried to get out.  Where were the proof-readers?  I cannot recommend this book unless you are willing to put up with lots of glaring errors.  The kicker is that the errata page for this book on the O'Reilly website has nothing listed.  
 This author is part of the nonsense of the Bush takeover of local public schools through the No Child Left Behind law.  She has enriched herself through the forced sale of the strange Open Court reading program as a so-called research based program. Frequent public speaker with a big mouth and nothing to back it up 
 There only a handful of exercies in this book? they are very basic and anyone who has gone to a therapist knows more than this book has to offer. Try a diffrent book with more to offer 
 No free lunch & you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product?  Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product.. 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 When I read a review of this book, I was interested and checked it out of the library. It was a quick and easy read, and, unfortunately, also a disappointment.  In author Shellenbarger's favor, it must be said that the book is literate, well-organized and based on a reasonable methodology of data collection. It even has footnotes. It categorizes female midlife crisis into specific types, and gives defining examples of each.  However, _The Breaking Point_ is also quite superficial, despite a few offhand references to Jungian psychology. After awhile, the collected personal stories which are used as examples start to sound like a litany of airheaded people who made bad decisions (dropped out of college to get married, married emotionally remote men, tried to mold themselves according to other people's expectations) and eventually wound up paying the price. The book also has virtually no perspectives that are not rooted in the last 50 years of human experience, which makes it difficult to take seriously.  I am a 52-year-old woman, recently retired, and I find it impossible to identify with these people. I also find it absolutely astonishing that anyone should find the notion of continued personal growth a radical solution to any problem.  This book may possibly be of assistance to women who are like those the author interviewed. There is at least one piece of sensible advice herein: throwing yourself into a series of sexual or romantic affairs may be dangerous to your mental health and your marriage.  Sorry, Sue, nice concept, weak execution.   
 This is a childrens book and it is supposed to teach a positive message. It should have been tiltled the "jewish Mother " tree or something. So the message was Use me and use me and use me some more and after I'm all used up, use me some more and I will be happy. Thats something we want to convey to children 
 Simplistic doesn't begin to capture the wisdom herein expresse 
 There is no point in buying this book if you have read Make the Connection.  Calling this a new book borders on fraud 
 The Great Wave is what results when someone who does not have any understanding of economics writes economic history.      The author's attempt to equate increases in prices due to catastrophic harvests or plague three to five hundreds years ago with the increase in general prices during the twentieth century to an expansionary monetary policy manages to, at once, understate what has been best about human progress and overstate what has been worst about it. 
 Don't spend your money!   The tips in this book are teaching 101, if you have been to college :) then this is what you learned.  Pre-service teachers don't waste your money -- the tips in this book are in your text book and free on the internet 
 This book has at least 10 authors and is fun to read for the first few chapters. Then I really got annoyed to read the same things over and over again and at the same time I missed some more in depth explanations. A lot is done with the framework itself. This is probably due to the very early delivery date of the book. Though I really enjoyed the C# example (game of life) I think you be better served with Hollis, Lhotka "VB.Net Programming". Also there seem to be quite a few other books out by now 
 This is a review of the Avery 3279 Ink Jet Dark T-Shirt Transfers. But I wouldn't be surprised to discover that the rest of the stuff they make is ALSO junk.  This stuff is EXPENSIVE....over $15 for five sheets from Office Depot. I had put in a brand new ink cartridge just a couple of days prior (HP PSC 1410 Inkjet)  and it was working fine on normal paper. Read all the directions carefully and more than once. First time, the paper CUT OFF the top portion of the image.....sure, blame it on the printer; but if so, why didn't normal paper do this? Second time, it printed really wimpy and hazy grey....yet I had set the printer to use MAXIMUM dpi! I thought, "OK, maybe it will darken from the heat of the iron. Set the kitchen timer, ironed it exactly as instructed....and it is STILL a sickening hazy grey instead of the crisp black I wanted! AND some of the darkness of the fabric below is showing through the white portions. Oh yes...it is INCREDIBLY difficult to peel off the backing...you do end up having to tear a portion of the design you create, pretty much ruining it.  So....wasted time shopping for this. Overpaid for the product. Wasted HOURS prepping the image. And now I have a ruined tote bag that can't be replaced. Avery scum, I HATE YOU 
 I have seen several films about Van Gogh, all which were fascinating.  In each Van Gogh was a character that was portrayed in a manner that was human and who had ideas and humanity as well as a need to do art.  By contrast, Harris' Pollock lacked any humanity, except for one scene where he takes a dog to a vet.  And Pollock didn't seem to be someone who thought about life at all.  He hardly cared about anyone and in the whole movie connected with no one with the exception of his wife, and that was far more a practical relationship than a love relationship.  His wife Lee was portrayed as a generally uninteresting person as well.  I was not drawn in by the film at all by any of the main characters.  Pollock's gift to the world was his art; who he was and the life he lived were not worth making a movie of if this is the best the story can be told in film.  
 I have always loved books by Debbie Macomber, but this one is the exception.  It seemed forced and disjointed--would not recommend at all...maybe this series should come to an end 
 I have recently purchased the tape series of Love 101 much to my disappointment.  If you are looking for a little reinforcement and a different perspective on how to accomplish self-esteem, these are not the  tapes for you.  However, if you enjoy listening to introductions to clips  of nostalgic music and comedy routines then you might want to give this a  try.  I found that the subject matter had little to do with self-esteem  directly but more to do with announcing the next "ditty" ranging  from Mae West to Al Jolson and Groucho Marx.  I doubt if most of these  routines and songs have seen the light of day since the big band era. These  tapes were more of a trip down memory lane than a "boost" in  one's self-esteem 
 We cannot get the refill bags into our Diaper Dekor Plus. Are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit? The lady in the store said NO so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills. Now we cant use any of them. What should we do 
 If Disney ever wanted to make the argument that they have not lost touch with their childhood roots, I would strongly suggest not mentioning Snow Dogs in that argument.  Sure, the numbers showed that this film was a success (i.e. the budget was $35 million and it took in $81 million in the US alone), but the final product that was released to the screen was nothing but sheer drivel.  From the unoriginal story, to the inconsistent characters, to the painful acting of Cuba Gooding, Jr., Snow Dogs proved two truths.  The first is that Disney can successfully make and mass-produce B-level cinema.  The second is that they can make Oscar-winning actors give the worst performances of their careers.  Snow Dogs demonstrates fully that some people in Hollywood choose money over scripts, they choose flimsy over developed, and recycled over original.  What upset me the most about this film was the use of CGI to exaggerate the dog's expressions.  To me, that is a huge slap in Cuba Gooding, Jr's face.  If the studio didn't think that Cuba could successfully make the audiences laugh, then they needed to get stronger talent, do not muddle the genre with CGI created eyes, mouths, and expressions on the dogs.  With this CGI, I felt as if I was watching a quick fix to an already unfixable problem.  Did I go into this film expecting greatness?  Not in any way shape or form.  What I did expect was a level of professionalism topped with some brilliant "something" to make me utterly aware that this was a Disney film and while they may have a bad film on their hands, at least they may throw money to fix the problem.  Again, my expectations were demolished.  It became very obvious as I watched this film that half of the scenes were in front of a green screen, not actually in Alaska.  Some of the more emotional moments were completely ruined by the horrid special effects in place.  Disney has the money, where did the $35 million dollar budget go?  From the CGI created dog "faces" to the CGI trees, bears, and mountains, you never felt like you were in Alaska at all, but instead warmly comfortable inside an obvious soundstage.  Pay up Disney, you cheated me on this one...  For this to be a full review, I have to mention the acting.  It pains me to do so because nobody, I repeat, NOBODY could muster any form of "reality" to this film.  From the delivery of the lines, the horrid physical comedy (which never worked), to the random moment of romance, not one character in this movie stayed in character or gave us any semblance of an actual character.  I watched an hour and a half of actors awkwardly demonstrating to us that they did not know their characters, that they did not know their lines, and that the paycheck at the end was more important than the work throughout the process.  I place solely the blame on Cuba Gooding, Jr.  What happened to him?  From the opening scene in Miami to the ending embarrassing "catch-phrase", I felt like Cuba should have handed the Academy back the award and apologized to everyone profusely.  There are lines in Snow Dogs that were obviously read from a cue card.  There were moments when it was obvious Cuba didn't care.  He showed no range of emotion, no rational credibility, and again, there was no character.  Who was Cuba Gooding, Jr. in this film?  Just like a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know!  I could easily, and sadly, say the same about James Coburn.  He was awarded an Oscar as well and the best he can manage is Snow Dogs?  Who was Thunder Jack?  What was his story, what made him gruff, what ... what ... what ... just too many questions running through my mind with these key actors that it makes me feel sorry for the child audience this film was aimed towards.  It was very clear that neither of these actors were passionate about the story for they would have stopped early and backed away.  I would have thought that Cuba (or at least James Coburn) would have put their hands down when it was discovered that SISQO (Mr. Thong himself) was going to be a key player.  Unbelievable is the level of lacking respect that both of these actors had for themselves.  The proof is in Snow Dogs.  What bothered me the most about this film was the lack of intelligence aimed towards children.  This was a "family" film, yet racism seemed to be slapped directly in your face.  There was a scene that sticks out in my mind when Gooding tries to find his real father and assumes that it can only be the other black man in town.  When it is discovered that it is someone else, there is a shock in the community.  This film was released in 2002, with the society that we live in why would this be such a shock to the system?  Couple this with the fact that Michael Bolton brings us the "inspirational" line from the film, "It doesn't matter what color you are, everyone can have soul."  Egh.  Where did this come from, and is this a "good" message to send to children?  This ranks right next to the feeling that Gooding's love-interest was the only woman within a 100-mile radius, and that those living in Alaska are grizzly men with bad teeth.  I felt midway through this film that Disney executives were in their offices insisting on another Cool Runnings-esque film (there was even a Volkswagen moment in this one).  Sadly, with Snow Dogs their request became a nightmare.  Overall, this was a cheap film, which boasts Oscar-winners performing well below the bar, CGI dogs and background, a story that hinges on the edge of fantasy, and the quintessential Disney "bow of approval".  What I mean by this is that anything can happen, and with Disney films, it will.  Gooding has the finances to leave his dental practice for several weeks without worrying about missing work, he can learn how to dogsled within a couple days, saves a man's life, and he immediately falls in love with the only girl from town who happens to be a model in her spare time.  For those looking for a cute and cuddly film about dogs, I would not suggest this garbage.  It is predictable, pretentious, and pathetic.  Maybe a six-year old wouldn't mind the three "p", but this critic hated it!  Grade: * out of **** 
 I picked-up this book by chance in the book store as there is not a great deal written for non-academics on the subject of the early Church.  An hour into reading the book, I found I'd been had.  Beginning on page 7, we start to hear out of left field the muffled drumbeat "for" Mormonism by the author.  This is disingenous at best, and intellectually dishonest at worst.    If the author wants people to pay him so he can advertise for Mormonism, while he's allegedly presenting a reasoned and researched view on early Church development, say so up front.  A peek into the Index will reveal about a dozen references to Mormonism, a few for Judaism, even fewer for Islam, and ZERO for Protestant or Catholic traditions.  A quick googling of the author showed he's presented as a Mormon cult "apologist" and professional expert witness in courts cases.  Need I say more?  I'm returing this book tomorrow for a refund 
 I am glad to know it wasn't just me. I was really disappointed by this book. I have tried to read everyone of Cornwell's books and picked this one up based on past experience. It does not even come close to her usual skills. It may be that it was written for serialization in a magazine. It should not have been allowed out as a book. Her publishers did not do her a favor by letting this go out to the public. It is possible that Win and Sykes could become interesting characters in a well developed book; they were interesting in this book and I liked the setting in Cambridge, but it wasn't enough 
 I made this purchase in Oct has a X-mas gift.  They arrived and at quick glance appeared to be fine.  I immediately wrapped the earrings and they were hidden away.  X-mas morning after my young daughter open her gift I more closely examined them.  One of the earrings was completely grayish in color; so dark that I would consider it to be defective.  I called the Netaya customer service phone number only to be greeted with "Hello".  After verifying that I had indeed reached Netaya I briefly explained the defect and requested that I be permitted to return the earrings.  I was placed on hold and then told that "the lady" I needed to speak with was busy and I would need to call back or send an e-mail.  I e-mailed the company twice before receiving notice that they would not accept the return because 30 days had passed since purchase.  I would not recommend 
 I checked this book out because I'd bought How to Lose 200 Lbs in One Weekend on a friend's recommendation and got a lot out of it.  I wasn't just disappointed -- I was amazed at what Aslett considers reasonable in the quest for productivity.  If we followed Aslett's guidelines, we'd never stop to chat with a friend, would work through meals even if we were hungry (not that the meals would be worth stopping for -- Aslett considers spice to be "food clutter" and recommends sticking to unspiced food), eschew coffee breaks because lifting that cup to your lips takes time, time, time, rise earlier, work later and generally keep our noses to the grindstone at the expense of relaxation, recreation or pleasure of any kind.  This book reminded me of the old joke about the man who asks his doctor how to extend his life, and the doctor tells him to give up alcohol, women, and rich food.  "You won't live longer, but it will seem like an eternity."  Aslett may be able to cram forty-eight hours into one day, but what a miserable day it is 
 While I was distressed by the widely publicized essay by Mr. Churchill, I like to think of myself as a fair minded person and ordered two of his books from Amazon including this one.  Intially I was encourage by his generally more thoughtful approach and the massive number of specific references that could be checked out.  These gave the reader a chance to evaluate the substance of his ideas.  However in checking several of Mr. Churchill's specific references to support his thesis I realized that this writer was simply a advocate for a backwater political position who used errors and exaggerations to make his point.  In some cases his reference actually made the counter argument.  He uses the Sand Creek Massacre as a "proof" of the US intential policy of genocide.  This dispicable act of brutality by a military commander to build a reputation deserves no defense.  However the person responsible was investigated and was about to be court-marshalled for his derelict behavior as a leader when he resigned and disappeared.  The government did not order this massacre, not did it endorce it, but rather carefully examined the issues and condemned it.  This clearly demonstrated that officially the US does not have a policy of genocide.  One reviewer called him a patriot.  A patriot is defined by Webster as "one who loves his or her country and supports its authority and interests".  Whatever Mr. Churchill is, he is clearly not remotely a patriot.  He hates his country, advocates incessently for its destruction and urges people to destroy its authority and interests.  This perversion of normal language seems to be a common pattern with Mr. Churchill and his supporters.  I agree that his being an Indian or not is irrevalent to the merits of his book and its arguments.  It fails miserably as an academic work and should be relegated to an advocacy political pamphlet for Anarchy.  It is a relevant issue about his being hired as a professor where a major criteria for the position is that a person be an Indian.  This man by his own admission is at least 13/16 white.  My math may fail me but this makes him a white man and not qualified to apply for a position reserved for an Indian.  I believe I can easily understand the outrage against Mr. Churchill in the American Indian community.  He does not represent American Indians, he represents a failed political philosophy.  
  It's hard to explain exactly how horrible I think the female heroine was written in this book.  I can not believe any female would ever act as she had in her position.  This heroine had no brain in her head.  She got turned on by a trespasser rubbing himself up against a window naked yet thinking about how he was such a disgusting pervert.   Understanding that this girl only has a quarter of a brain in her head but to not call the police even though she thought about it was idiotic and that includes her thinking she was safer with her carrying the sword and then blaming someone else for her killing a person.  This heroine had a mentality of a 12 year old.  I'm normally a fan of Richard Laymon's books but this is one I definitely could have done with out.  The two books I have read where he has female heroines have just been horrible 
 The content is so elementary that this book cannot be considered a serious reference work for writers. Many of the "Common Errors" seem to have been made up in order to complete a targeted page count. If you already know the difference between "chunk" and "chuck," and know when to use "next door" instead of "next store" to convey your intended meaning, you can pass on this one 
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 Dr. Laura occasionally gives excellent advice, and I admire her willingness to stand up for what's decent and moral.  However, her supposition that husbands do not need a book or advice is almost blasphemous.  God created men and women and the institution of marriage, and even He gives instructions to husbands as to how they should treat their wives!  God "wrote a book" called the Bible which contains advice for husbands as well as wives because God knows the success of a marriage depends on BOTH parties doing their part.    This book is great for women who are unkind to their husbands.  When unkind people change and become kind and considerate to all those with whom they have a relationship, it CAN have an impact on the behavior of others.  But this applies not only to women and wives but to men and husbands as well.  Many women are suffering because, after reading all the books they can and doing everything within their power, their husbands do not respond.  So the self-doubting and blame continues, and it's needless.  The attitude that a successfull and happy marriage rests solely with the wife is detrimental to EVERY marriage 
 After reading most of this book, I realized that there are some good common sense tips that we just don't think about.  I immediately applied them and found some successful use of these tips.  However, the book chock full of poor explanations, some awful grammar (poor editing?), and certainly is a chore to soak in.  Charts leave you hanging, as they are poorly or lazily explained.  I read many technical networking books from Cisco Press, electronics engineering books, financial books, chess books, and other publications which many others would find difficult to read. I find this text near the top of the most difficult to read (speed-readers will not learn anything).  When comparing this book to other texts, it seems he's making a desparate attempt to cram his whole life's reaserch (his "working thesis"), abridged into one small book, with absolutely no effort to promote retention.  I believe Larry Willaims to be an expert on trading, and I welcome any info he has to offer, but I see him as no teacher.  It would be better for him to teach a string of writers, and practical acedemic teachers his techniques and let them connect his knowledge to the common reader 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 1. they leak 2. too expensive 3. they don't supply enough lids, so you have to buy more containers 4. doesn't work well for feedin 
     First of all, Steve Vai is in my opinion one of the most talented and exciting guitar players/musicians I've had the pleasure to see. That's high praise, because I've seen Stevie Ray, Van Halen (Roth era), Rhoads, Foghat, Frampton.......you get the picture. He is also an amazing person to meet and talk to. Very spiritual and just a great person; very positive.    Lately though, each time Steve puts out a new cd, I become more hesitant to lay down the cash because his music rocks less and just pushes the envelope in the wrong direction. This cd is too experimental. The playing is great, but the songs have no balls to them. Maybe Disney could use him for all the kids animation movies? It's just "girly".    I know he knows what people want, because he plays all the cool stuff in his live shows. Why is that? Because that's the stuff that is moving and what makes a live show "live". So why must we be subjected to  all the "filler" stuff? I'm not saying that all the songs have to be fast and rip, because he can play 2 notes with as much feeling as 1,000 notes. Please Steve, just write some songs in song form. The world is waiting for more jaw dropping music 
 I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment 
 The 1991 "Our Game" is a standalone post cold war spy story by that British master, John LeCarre: and he's written several memorable spy stories, such as "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold," and the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  This book exhibits some of his virtues as a writer: unsurpassed spycraft, strong set piece openings, and closings; plots that might keep a reader up way past bedtime, sharply drawn characters given snappy dialogue, and engrossing narrative and descriptive writing.  The book opens on Tim Cranmer, forcibly retired British cold war spy; luckily for him, he seems to have more than his share of wealthy relatives,enabling a comfortable retirement as a landed winemaker.  He has acquired a beautiful, much younger mistress whom he keeps in luxury.  And he's been able to place his oldest friend, Larry Pettifer, a friendly rival since Winchester, the elite public school(as the English call it; we call them private schools), and the elite unversity, Oxford, in a job nearby.  Mind you, Pettifer was also one of the deskbound Cranmer's spies, or joes, as Le Carre calls them; he was also a double agent, working for the Russians as well.  Yet there's nobody the cold Cranmer has ever been closer to.  Suddenly, Pettifer disappears, taking with him Cranmer's young mistress Emma. (He tells Cranmer:" You stole my life, I stole your girl.")  Cranmer soon discovers that Pettifer has committed himself to a new cause, for which he's taken with him $37 million Russian that he wasn't entitled to.  Cranmer also soon realizes his former employers at the spy shop suspect him of complicity in the theft; and, what's worse, a ruthless Russsian mafia does, too.  So Cranmer goes on the run, to Paris and Russia, remembering his helpful spycraft all the way, as he looks for Pettifer and Emma, while trying to avoid the parties looking for him.  At one point Cranmer muses: "He /Pettifer/ has been goading me about my indifference to the world's agonies....I have said that I never considered myself responsible for the world's ills, not for causing them, not for curing them.  The world was in my view a jungle overrun with savages, just as it had always been.  Most of its problems were insoluble....I have said that I have always been, and would continue to be, prepared to make sacrifices for my neighbours, compatriots, and friends.  But when it came to saving barbarians from one another in countries no bigger than a letter on the map, I failed to see why I should throw myself into a burning house to rescue a dog I had never cared for in the first place."  Now,unfortunately, readers who find that speech resonant, who perhaps are even saying to themselves some variation of: "Right on, brother, couldn't say it better myself," will have a problem.  Because, for reasons never made entirely clear, Cranmer will suddenly pull a 180 in his beliefs, grab a Kalashnikov rifle, and run off to try to put the world to rights himself.  For such readers, this book might not be the best place to start reading Le Carre.  
 The design is such that when you pour out liquid, some of it seeps into the space between the outer plastic and the vacuum glass container. Then, when one sets the carafe on a counter, the liquid leaks out. This could be a problem with a particular unit or a marginal design 
 This book basically puts forward a theory that the founders just established the Constitution for their own personal economic gain. This book is well-researched, but its premise is totally flawed. Moreover, it tries to portray all of the founding fathers as self-serving and looking out for their own economic interests. It doesn't really explain why some of the wealthiest colonists and statesmen such as George Mason and Elbridge Gerry refused to sign on. Moreover, I'd recommend that any student of the Constitution, study the writings of the framers and the Constitutional debates to answer these charges. I also recommend _The Founder's Constitution_ set, edited by Phillip Kurland and Ralph Lerner. It is an excellent tool for examining original intent. The renowned constitutional scholar, Forrest McDonald, does an excellent job introducing this book and debunking its controversial charge towards the Constitution 
 The strength of the Anne Perry books about William Monk and his nurse wife, Hester, is in describing the nitty-gritty of ordinary life in Victorian London.  In Funeral in Blue, Ms. Perry extends her talents to do the same for Vienna.  As a result, the book's best moments are those exploring the passions and conflicts of the unsuccessful revolution there in 1848.    Unfortunately, Ms. Perry overreaches herself in dragging those momentous events into the story.  The rest of the plot also seems contrived and moves oh so slowly.  Despite enough red herrings to fill a pickle barrel, it's very obvious to any reader who the murderer was except to the fictional characters who are investigating the murder.  As a result, the angst that William and Hester go through is simply painful to read.    I read this book after enjoying The Shifting Tide.  If you decide to read one of the novels in the series, I strongly suggest that you read The Shifting Tide instead.  It's vastly more interesting, fast moving and well constructed than this one 
 Typically these technical how-to books are badly written and rushed to print and I found this one to be no exception.  Although it offers some helpful hints not found in other Excel guides, it is rather wordy and vague in places. Some of the sample formulas simply do not work or else are not explained fully in context.  Added to this, the accompanying CD skimps on the first four chapters, making it impossible to follow along on some the exercises the author provides. In some cases, he doesn't even provide a sample table.  I went out and bought a copy of Microsoft's Excel Data Analysis and Business Modeling and find this to be better written, much more comprehensive, and easier on the wallet 
 Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. 1 Ladies...series.  No comparison.  The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book.  I just don't understand the rest of this book.  Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face.  The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book?  I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read 
 My wife got this book when homeschooling and my daughter picked out the motor experiment. We followed the directions but could not get the motor to work. After looking at the design I realized the armature winding was incorrect. The winding must go around the cork in parallel with the axis, not around the axis. Needless to say a child trying to build this would be extremely frustrated. I have a feeling the author did not build all the experiments. The lack of explanation of how the motor works is also a drawback 
 We received this as a gift for our daughter. She is now 9 months old and within 2 weeks of playing with it (again, she is 9 months old) elmo's head broke. The table no longer operates as all electrical is centered in Elmo's head.   A toy that we were very excited about turned out to be a dud.  
           Thankfully I got this book as part of a swap, and didn't pay anything more than postage for it. Cos it was a waste of Teri's time writing it, and a waste of my time reading it. I read to about page 50, and ended up even more depressed than I already was, so gave up.   This isn't a stereotypical biography. This is Teri Hatcher wallowing in self pity. Big time. It's nothing but saying how it's "tough" being a single mother, not getting many jobs until Desperate Housewives came along, how she didn't have any nookie with her husband on her honeymoon, how her husband doesn't love her, how's she divorced and over 40. Whoopee.   Don't buy this book. There's no juicy gossip about Lois & Clark (like, my favourite show ever!!!), and she's full of it. Blah, what a waste of time 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 I'm studying for the CPA. I bought the book because it's required for a course in school. But to actually learn for the CPA exam, I'll toss this one aside for one that provides a solutions manual. Authors who withold the manual for the instructors benefit miss a fundamental point about economics - who the customer is. It's the student that the book is written for and it is the student who pays for the course. Breffni University of Chicag 
 This book provides a broad overview of some of the issues behind the Simplicity movement.  The author, Cecile Andrews set up a number of Simplicity study circles near her home in the Northwest.  This book reveals some of the factors that led her to become interested in Simplicity as well as her ideas of how Simplicity study circles might work.  Much of the beginning of the book provides justification for adopting Simplicity.  Andrews enumerates problems such as hyper-consumption, environmental degradation, and personal isolation.  She also explores possible actions we could take to solve these problems, such as consciously building community with other people and the earth, finding ways to express our spirituality, and restructuring our economic system to make it more environmentally and socially friendly. In the last part of the book, she describes the idea of Simplicity study circles, the benefits that might be gained from participating in one, and how a study circle should operate.  She also provides a 10-week study plan based on the earlier material in the book.  Although I agree with the ideas in this book, I found the book rather disappointing in content.  Much of the discussion is either so personal as to be hard to generalize, or else a superficial summary of other more substantial texts.  For example, Andrews frequently refers to findings of Juliet Schor; readers would have more material for discussion by reading Schor's works directly.  Some of Andrews' suggestions for addressing problems are rather inappropriate.  To draw attention to hyper-consumerism, she suggests surreptitiously clothes-pinning tags with messages like "You don't really need this, do you?" inside articles of clothing in shops.  While I'm all for trying to get people to become more aware of their needless purchases, I don't think messing with the property of individual store owners is an acceptable way to go about the mission.  Her suggestions for reforming our economic system would be great in an ideal state, but until we are run by a benevolent socialist dictator, I don't think they can realistically be put into action.  It would be better to focus our efforts on goals that are conceivably achievable.  Overall, while I found the topic of this book interesting, I think there are numerous other books on the topic of Simplicity that are better implemented, starting with Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin's "Your Money or Your Life".  It's hard to tell from this book if Andrews can take credit for originating Simplicity study groups such as those run by the Northwest Earth Institute.  If so, she certainly deserves credit for her efforts in that area, but I don't think there's enough substantial material in this volume to use as background reading for an effective study group by itself. 
 This is worse than my eighth birthday party. Some kid brought his pet Teradactyl and let go of the leed. Also, the hired band 'The Caz Dolowicz Experience' didn't show up. Something about a hijacked subway train. They think we're mugs? Anyway, the photography in GC was worse. Everbody too big in the frame and sort of artless and wobbly. How does Rachel Leigh Cook manage to appear in so many disasters? Does she have a homing beacon in her nose? It's a very small nose which just goes to show how amazing technology is today. Stallone looks like he's on Dialysis. I didn't watch the end. It either ends in a friendly game of Jim Rummy or a blowtorch enema. Gosh, I wonder 
 Manowar has self proclaimed the loudest band on Earth, ... but this release leave them completelly out of that statement !!!!  Let me put it this way, there are 16 tracks in this CD: 7 are dull, boring fillers, instrumental or cheesy spoken intros (Overture to the Hyms, Ascension, Army parts I and II, Overture of Odin, Blood of Odin and Glory), thay leave us 9 just "songs". 3 of them are boooooooring ballads (Blood brothers, Odin and Hymn), which leave us with only 6 METAL songs. 3 of them are very cool but we have heard them already in the "Sons of Odin" EP (King of Kings, Sons of Odin and Gods of War), that leaves us with just 3 "new" songs. One of them has the stupidest lyrics ever (Die for Metal). That leaves us with ONLY 2 songs worth for the album (Sleipnir and Loki). Those are outstnding and my favorite songs by the way, but the fact of having just 2 songs out of 16, makes you think twice if you really want to spend your money in this album. I did it because I have all the releases from Manowar and I am a completist, but if you are not a Manowar fan or a completist, stay away from it and use your hard earned money in some other CD.    
 Besides the fact that the book is "dry", in which most Math theory based books are,  the examples are just the basis step towards solving a problem.  I equate it to teaching a child how to add, and just giving them the example "1 + 0", then assume they can figure out the rest.  There are no answers, either in the back of the book for particular exercies, nor was a study guide made available.  What is really shocking is that it's the most expensive book out there! Not to mention that there isn't any programming steps made available.  Great text for a Math major ... horrible textbook for Computer Science Majors, mainly because  computer science majors would want to see programming examples and may not be as strongly math oriented as a Math major would be 
 Very little plot, which is boring. The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book! 
 this book is better than others on this topic. however, it missed some very important things  such as what components should be downloaded and how to set tem up to test the examples. all programs in this book are missing  the packages needed to be imported.is this book written to impress  colleages of the authors? if the intension is to help the mess understand  and use Javaspace, then i would like to ask the author to fill in the  missing parts!  reading this edition of the book, i felt as if i  was  admiring the world's tallest building, but  as soon as i went inside, i  found the builder had forgotten to put in the elavators 
 Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey  
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 The 1994 Blackstone Audio Book version of "Turn of the Screw" is read by Pat Bottino.  Mr. Bottino's uninspired presentation destroyed the story. Perhaps Mr. Bottino got better in later ventures, I don't know, but he mangled "Turn". Avoid this version at all costs 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 I would say that this book is poorly written, except that saying that it was written at all gives it too much credit. Almost no writing was done for this book; it's more accurate to say that the book was "compiled" out of a stack of example problems.  The author seems to have taken the idea that, "Students don't ever really read textbooks" to heart and crafted a book that simply cannot be read. The best you can do is browse through it, looking for examples that match what you're trying to do and studying them. His sample solutions are detailed, but they make little attempt to teach the intuition behind why certain steps are chosen. Nor can that intuition be learned from the main text of the chapter, as there is wretchedly little of it.  A horrible book; bad even by the low standards that math textbooks are generally held to 
 I have little doubt that Oscar Wilde and Bosie had extraordinary sexual adventures, but one little thing keeps coming back to me: early in this book, the author identifies Ganymede as the Trojan boy whom Zeus abducted and "anally raped."  What was that?  Was there a source for that?  I flipped to the back of the book, and of course there was no source.  It was apparently "just something the author heard on good authority."  I have been involved in gay scholarship for decades and have read dozens of books about Ancient Greece, and this book is absolutely the first place that I have read about Zeus' alleged anal rape of Ganymede.  I will say one thing with absolute certainty: there is no Ancient Greek source which supports the author.  Centuries later, getting into Medieval and Renaissance Europe, there may well have been all sorts of tales about Ganymede.  He had passed into the popular language: men referred to a handsome boy as some other man's "Ganymede," and from this we ultimately get the word "catamite."  But the actions of the Great God Zeus?  He changed himself into an eagle and abducted Ganymede to Mount Olympus to serve as his wine-pourer.  Period.  Now, this one little thing may seem to be just that: one little thing.  But this book about Oscar Wilde is full of details.  And if the author is not trustworthy on the details, then one must wonder about the value of this book.  Not recommended 
 Butterfly Stories is pretentious and overwritten creating a writing style that presents the reader with prose that is obscure for obscurity's sake.  This was a most annoying and unfulfilling reading experience.  Similar to some of Vollman's other work - this novel is primarily about a man developing unhealthy attachments to prostitutes with Vietnam and the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia as background.  Unfortunately the writing style is so overblown it gets in the way of good story telling. 
 As per usual, any woman who entertains an independent thought---one not handed down to her by the male establishment---is immediately suspect. It's not women who are making the world worse---it's the idiots currently in charge of the government, starting with the president and vice-president and continuing through Rove and DeLay and a herd of congressmen. I'm sorry that the conservatives think women should stay home and raise families and not poke their heads out of the kitchen or nursery. I'm sorry they believe gutsy women are the cause of all the ills in the universe. I feel sorry for them that they'll never experience the satisfaction that comes from being their own person, beholden to no one, because they have a paying job and a degree of independence. When the world comes to value "women's work" and makes raising kids, cleaning house and fixing meals a well-paid endeavor, I might think that women would be better off in the home. Until then, I'm not buying it. Viva to those Women Who Make The World Worse! To those who would turn back the hands of time to the 1800s when women were chattel, Raspberries by the score.   People like Kate O'Beirne scare me no end

 Basically what Picknett and Prince (believers in the Priory of Sion) have tried to do is to absorb all the damning negative evidence about Pierre Plantard and try to come up with all kinds of various excuses to try to make the subject matter sound serious. But their attempt contains significant omissions, sloppy treatment of the facts and hilarious unjustifiable assumptions that only specialists in the subject matter are able to spot - this is just another howler of a book from them. All interest in the Priory of Sion in France was terminated during the mid-1980s because by that time it was generally realised in that country that the whole thing was a Fake (and the books by Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh were never taken seriously in France either). The authors never bothered to contact authorities like Jean-Luc Chaumeil, who can easily prove by providing primary source evidence that the whole thing was a fake from beginning to end. You do not have to be a hyper-sceptic to know that this whole subject matter is fake but you need to be hyper-gullible to take the Priory of Sion seriously.  
 Jethro Creighton is living in the time of the Civil war.  It is just about to start and he is excited.  Jethro and his family live in southern Illinois.  So they live in a union state and have a union family.  All of Jethro's brothers go into the war, and also his cousin.  His brother John and Tom, and also his cousin Eb, go to fight for the union.  However, his brother Bill makes a decision to fight with the confederacy.  Jethro respects his decision and still loves him.  While a lot of his family is out at war, Jethro is still at home and expected to work even harder out on the farm.  All day he works in the heat, but he doesn't mind it so much.  But things start going wrong.  His brother Tom is killed in battle, it is very sad.  While that happened, some of the men in the down are very angry that Bill went to the confederacy.  They call him a traitor and said he deserted the union.  Then they start taking action for it and start tormenting the Creighton's.  After countless things they end up burning the Creighton's house down.  Then Jethro finds Eb, he had deserted the union army.  Jethro wrote a letter to President Lincoln to see what he needs to do.  Jethro doesn't tell the family cause he doesn't want anyone to get in trouble.  Later the war ends and Jethro gets his education.  This book was ok, not the greatest I have ever read.  There were things about it that I liked and there were things that I didn't like so much.  I liked how it showed what war is really like. It showed that enemies aren't always your enemies. What I didn't like is that it was sort of boring.  This book showed what war is really like.  Sometimes people actually want to go into war.  They do not see what it is really like. It's really hard to imagine what it is really like.  At the begging of the book Jethro is excited about it, he thinks that it will be fun, cool, and interesting.  Later on in the book he figures out that it is none of those.  He realizes that war is horror, filled with pain and sorrow.  His brother dies; he doesn't even know how any of the other ones are doing.  This portrays the way war is in a great way.   This book showed that your enemies aren't always really your enemies.  A lot of them can actually be your friend, even if you don't know it.  In this book there is a family that has a bad reputation.  The son of the man who started the bad reputation killed Jethro's sister accidentally.  But then Jethro goes on a ride with the father.  He is frightened but then the man saves Jethro from people that want to hurt him, so really he is his friend.  Also, even though some of Jethro's brothers are fighting each other, they aren't really enemies; they all still love each other.  	This book was sort of boring.  Though many things happen in it it's hard to stay with it.  There isn't too much action that you actually read about.  You hear about things that happen but you never get to read like you were there.  Such as all the battles, you just read about what happened, not as if you were there.  This book was alright.  I'm not sure I would read a sequel if it had one.  There were just things about it that were good and some bad features also.  I would recommend this book to people who like reading a lot and don't care if there is action or suspense in a book.  -J. Hamilto 
 This book makes the most grievous error a book can make: it's boring.  The title sounded intriguing, but the book is a real snooze.  I skipped page after page looking for something of interest to read.  Alas, I found nothing.  Talk about disappointment.  I was hoping for a scathing analysis of the degradation of language in contemporary discourse and music.  What I got was...well, I'm not sure but it put me to sleep within 5 minutes.  I don't want to read in-depth analyses of speeches from 1856 or whatever.  Maybe there's another book out there that discusses the devaluation of language in pop culture in a compelling way.  This one ain't...I mean, isn't, it

 I enjoyed Ferling's Leap In The Dark immensely.  It was a well-written, far-reaching, grand book that formed a great cohesive work.  As such, i figured this book (about a very under-reported time-period in US history) would be a slam-dunk.  Not so.  It's almost as if Ferling expended so much energy with Leap that he decided to phone this one in.  It's incohesive, jumping around with little regard to logical continuity.  Yet, even at this, it comes off as a shallow non-scholarly work that is better suited to a magazine article than a book.  I was about ready to have Ferling join McCullough & Ellis as authors i would count on to deliver quality consistently.  Alas, not quite yet.  
 Here's a book about a man who has everything - wealth, good family, but he wants more. The main character has sinful urges that he tries to fight off unsuccessfuly. Sound familiar? Well, this was written before American Psycho, but this book takes forever to get into the good evil stuff and is a lot less descriptive. It is drawn out, but Selby does a good job of painting a picture of this man's mind and making you want to see what this is capable of. But it comes so late in the book and by then you are like, yeah so? Eh, decent read for fans of Ellis masterpiece 
 When I first read this book, I loved it.  That was a long time ago, and I am older and wiser now. Now I realize that it is extremely important to read both sides of an issue before coming to a conclusion. Hislop, sadly, uses the power of selective information: You will only find part of the story in this book. I strongly recommend that you read Ralph Woodrow's "The Babylon Connection?" before coming to any conclusions based on this book.  We Christians are supposed to be as "wise as serpants"-- do your historical homework before buying into Hislop's ideas 
 Arthur J. Magida's presentation of Louis Farrakhan does provide an over-lapping glimpse into the formation and attraction of the Nation of Islam to the reader. For all of the attacks against the NOI as a so-called hate group, deliberate dis-information put out to the public, particularly the jewish public, the Nation of Islam has emerged as the principal converter to Islam and voice for BLACK people in america!   It would be wise to first read the Original Man by Claude Clegg III in establishing a basic understanding for the NOI and its attraction to and for BLACK people. Claude Clegg's book would also provide the reader with insight as to why the government of america and its so-called law enforcement agencies began to harass in 1930, and today, the Nation Of Islam. Many outside of the NOI refuse to deal with the actual facts of the crimes perpetuated against BLACK people that Elijah Muhammad posited for 44-years, and the necessity of BLACK people to separate themselves from their 6,000 year old open enemy who has murdered, maimed, tortured, lied on, and destroyed the reputations of BLACK people for simply wanting freedom, justice and equality.  Another book to read before this one is The Secret Relationship Between BLACKS and Jews. This book, while having been denonced by certain zionist groups, has been researched from actual jewish archives, letters, commerce information and jewish scholars. Finally, as to Louis Farrakhan's alleged remark that judaism is a gutter religion, he did not say that. His actual quote was, "to practice judaism, which is following the doctrine of the law of moses the lawgiver in the old testament of the bible, according to orthodox jews is the true judaism. To exploit people, particularly BLACK people, feeding on them and taking money out of the BLACK community charging exorbitant prices for cheaply made goods and services, is someone that is practicing a gutter religion by using BLACK people to enrich the jewish community." Let us deal with truth and not lies put out by the ADL and Daniel Pipes! Go purchase the tape of the lecture that Louis Farrakhan allegedly made those statements to corroborate the authenticity of what he said instead of spectulation! Arthur Magida's book is good for what it's worth 
 This book was difficult to read in my opinion because it inched along in Wealthy Barber fashion. Some people like that, but I don't. You had to read about detailed mall conversations with fictitious people for a page before you get to the part about budgeting. Ultimately, the book does not address what to do with the complex issues of envelope budgeting such as a single Walmart purchase of clothing, food, toys, and cleaning supplies. Do you haul out four envelopes and make change? How do you carry large amounts of cash safely? All the "how to's" conclude with a suggestion to do the envelopes with software, i.e., the disk included with the book. This is nothing more than a software sales pitch, and it gets worse.  In order to use your 30 day trial of the disk included in the book, you must ante up your credit card number and agree to pay the a monthly fee if you forget to cancel. You cannot access the software without signing up for this service. I got taken. You don't have to 
 It is my good fortune to be in a college program aimed at the adult learner.  I had heard much about today's college atmosphere molding many of our young people into politically correct animals and was glad that type of teaching was not reaching me.  Unfortunately it found me in a Business Ethics course which uses this book.  Messrs Shaw and Barry, in a writing style that is very familiar to me, do a rather unethical job in an attempt to bring you around to their point of view.  In the book they cite single sources with assurances that others must feel the same, use the famed, 'many have said' frame of mind, and introduce each chapter with one of societies ills, the entire purpose of which seems only to be to cast a negative light preparing the reader to dislike something that follows.  In a specific example, a section on the natural right to property (p 146, 2nd paragraph) in a part of the chapter that is supposed to show the moral justifications of capitalism has a sentence that reads as follows:  "Although we are no longer permitted to own other people, we are certainly free to own a variety of other things, from livestock to stock certificates, from our own home to a whole block of apartment buildings."  I was so bothered by this one sentence that I had to put the book down for an hour.  There were no statements on slavery in the beginning of the chapter and after looking there was nothing that would indicate a disclaimer about not being able to own people in the entire book.  Yet here was a statement in a section that was supposed to show the morality of capitalism that gets shot down in the second sentence.  If this were the only example of questionable writing in the book I would not have written this review.  Another section that was supposed to define capitalism spent more that half the section discussing socialism.  Much of this book seems to be designed to incite a person's emotions.  As an adult learner it seems silly to me to attempt to coerce my viewpoint in such a manner.  My open mind is better reached through logical discussion of facts and views rather than this unethical attempt to work at my underbelly.  I'm insulted and disappointed by the attempt.  What bothers me more is that other students not my age (33) are being influenced or coerced by material of this type in advanced learning institutions.  I'm concerned that these are the types of texts and the professors that teach from them that drive children to throw tofu pies and yell 'shame on you' at officials just for eating meat 
 This book is interesting if you are just looking for name that sound different, but don't believe in what the author wrote.  As a French person, I had to have a look at the french section. I was really surprise to find names that were either not french at all or don't exist at all (like "beau", which is the french term for pretty or nice, but is not a name... please don't call your child "beau", it would make any French or french speaking person laugh!)  I have no way to know whether the rest of the book was writen the same way, but how could I trust it now 
 This was to go to my son who chose it in his wish list. Instead it is coming to me and I can get no response. PLEASE SEND THIS TO MY SON AND NOT TO M 
 I would have rated this book with no star if I could. Severin was such a horrific character. Forget about the rape scene, what about the one where Severin punished Hastings for being jealous of Lady Marjorie by tying her to the ground and made her eat on the floor with his dogs in front of everyone in the dining hall????!! Is that supposed to be romantic? This is suppposed to be a romance novel, not strictly historical fiction. As such, there has to be some romantic element to the story, but I found nothing romantic whatsoever between Hastings' and severin's relationship. This is definitely the worst book I've ever read bar none! 
 I subscribed to Cooks Magazine some years ago, back when it  began publishing again.  I had problems with issues that failed to arrive, and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern.  Since that time, I occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest.  Even by dint of casual glance, I've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the "perfect recipe" for something or other.  I now skip right to the "perfected" recipe, and decide whether its worth committing to memory.  Some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best.  There are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me:  1.  Product Reviews:  They range from just plain wrong to idiotic.  The KitchenAid Pro 600 was hailed by Cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores.  Yet, the Amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart, allowing the metal gears to separate.  Christopher Kimball (the editor) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight.  No, I'm not joking.  In that evaluation, Le Creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy.  All-Clad, even though it conducts heat very evenly, suffered for not having as much heft, and therefore was judged pricey, on a pound weight basis.  One issue of Cooks boasted on its cover "Unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others".  Apparently, Hershey's was designated best.  Not too many months later, Callebaut was recommended above all others, and Hershey's was judged barely acceptable.  Feeling manipulated yet?  2.  Finally, there are those dreadful editorials by Mr. Kimball.  Rambling, painfully written, and punctuated with a picture of Mr. Kimball wearing a bow tie, and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it. Mr. Kimball is a humble man, with much to be humble about.  He writes as if he were chanelling Helen Gurley Brown, but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play.    Time to re-vamp this magazine, folks 
 This used to be my favorite magazine, but now it's just ad after ad after ad.  I go outside to get away from it all, and I like to read about climbing, biking, hiking, etc., when I have to be inside.   All the ads drain the joy from me.  
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 as a 14 year old girl spending my entire summer reading this book was possibly the worst thing my teacher could have done to me. i can definately see how some older people could somehow get into it but its really just not that good in my perspective, to me the symbolism made no sense i didnt understand what they were saying most of the time and i'm an honor roll student with straight A's in english. i really deeply and truly do not suggest this book to anyone that is a teenager because it will bore you to death. it did me. pips character was too boring estella was too much of a brat miss havisham was too shrill, the ONLY good part of this book was herbert. he was the only one i liked. my mother loved this book and is now driving me insane with how much she is into it. yes, this book has given Dickens a bad name in my mind although he may not be a bad writer. i can usually somewhat get into english literature but this was just about all i could bear.in a nutshell...its definately a college read. 
 This book was an enjoyable story, but it had many points that did not hold my attention. I also could not find much interest in the book due to the fact that it was a tedious story. Many points got boring and I would have trouble concentrating. This is just an average book. I would only reccomend it to a middle-school reader. 
 The recipes are all fine and good but they require a gigantic shopping list and cooking for 4.  Not realistic.  I have a 5 month old and have lost the weight but not with the help of this book.  Eat less exercise more but don't deprive yourself of anything 
 I liked very much Trout and Ries, Positioning and Marketing Warfare. Reading this book, I had an impression that most of the professional knowledge the author has, was distilled in his previous books.  Mr Trout is doing something he said was not a good practice in Advertising (see Positioning): Line Extension. The good parts of this book you will find in his previous books, maybe with different phrases and examples.   The other thing that is hurting is that he is trying to give advice in areas where he has limited knowledge and experience.   Looking at some titles of the chapters in this book you will find:  Chapter 4 - Quality and Customer Orientation are rarely differentiating Ideas.  Toyota and Honda achieved a position in the mind of customers worldwide that they make high quality products for a good price. Well, it will be difficult for the other automakers, who are actually working to catch up in quality, to differentiate themselves on quality, for they are also runs. I would say that is a hell of a strategy, maybe is not for everyone, but them differentiation is by definition for a few, and not for everybody.  How many companies have positioned themselves as high quality products? Does it pay? Go ask Nikon, Zeiss, Leica, Volvo, Patek Philippe...  Chapter 5 has as title: "Creativity is not a differentiating Idea"  I guess I cannot believe that Mr. Trout has read his own phrase. Does he mean that lack of creativity is a differentiating Idea? Does not make sense. I think quite the opposite, when you are not able to create something unique, is when you go out trying to do something else to differentiate yourself.    I have seen creativity applied to Advertising, the results were fantastic. In Brazil, sometime ago, Brastemp, (a Home Appliances company with financial links with Whirlpool) run an ad campaign that stressed the Quality of Brastemp products using the phrase: " it is not a Brastemp !". Each ad told a story about something (not related to appliances) and the concluding remarks would be " it is not a Brastemp !". The phrase got so popular, that became incorporated as an expression of our language. The end result was that Brastemp established itself in the market so strongly that still today people in Brazil position Brastemp as the top quality producer of home appliances. In the mind of the Brazilian consumer Brastemp is top quality, better than GE, Electrolux, ex-Westinghouse, etc...  I have seen creativity applied to Product Design with similar results.   This book should be read with a critical eye, for it has some impressive phrases but when you think a second time and compare with some practical experience you find problems.   I am not an advertising professional, I just enjoy reading books that come with good new ideas.     
 I am extremely disappointed with this book.  I bought it because I thought it would provide more ideas for "Jewelry Making"-it did not. When this book arrived, I had been working with polymer clay for 4 days and I learned nothing from the book that I had not figured out for myself, with the exception of how to make weird naked women from clay-not quite was a looking for.A waste of  [money] 
 This is really sad, this is an otherwise excellent collection. But in today's quest for everything to be LOUD, the over compressed this so that it's lost almost all dynamic range, and is just stressfull to listen to. You hear things you never did before-- BECAUSE THAT WEREN"T SUPPOSED TO STAND OUT IN THE MIX!  Everything just stays at the same level, it sounds like there are some phase issues on some tracks as well.  I just encoded a couple tracks and the originals, do that if you want to see it-- the songs are all peaked at max level throughout on the remaster. The original has highs and lows...well, dynamics! imagine that!  This is unlistenable to me, stick with the original. Of course it may be worth having for the rare stuff, sadly that's no better. Every instrument at the same level. REM from this time is classic, but they've butchered it 
 I thought this book was going to include style tips and more how to's than it did. It had some how to's but not for interior design. (Incidentally, there are no photographs in this book, just some simple drawings. How can you write a book on interior design without including any pictures?) The book was also chock full of Emily Post style tips on writing letters, making time for yourself without feeling guilty, what kind of foods to prepare when, and tons of other little feel-good snippets. If you want great tips on interior design, find a better book than this one 
 Package missing.  It's never be received.  So I cannot rate it 
 Thus book is not well-done.  The pictures seem over-colored and blurry with hand shadows.   The instruction section gave me a headache.  All white yarn on a blue background.  White is not a good yarn to demonstrate things in.  It tends to bleach out in photos.    This book does have a good description of novelty yarns (eyelash, fur, fuzz, flat, chunky, multi-strand, metallic and jelly) in case you didn't know what to call each of them.     And the patterns?  Just would you would think.  Garter, garter and wait for it....a little stockinette! Lots of fuzzy cuffs, a denim jacket ruined with some kind of novelty knitted sleeve and some simple top patterns.  The only thing that was interesting to me was a jelly bag mainly because I was not aware of jelly yarn.  This is just another book capitalizing on the knitting craze and marketing itself to new knitters who love novelty yarn and need simple patterns.  
  I was really excited to receive the Leisa Hart abs workout from amazon after reading all of the excellent reviews.To my disappointment this ab workout turned out to be terrible! I exercise daily and am getting my degree in physical fitness but I would say that I am intermediate to advanced. When I popped this dvd in my friend and I were ready to get a good abs workout, but neither of us even felt a burn! (My friend is a beginner..) I figured that maybe I was not doing the moves correctly but when I tried it again with an intermediate exercising buddy, we stopped halfway through and put in another dvd. I just don't understand how everyone else on Amazon is posting all of these good reviews! Please don't listen to them if you are used to doing ab workouts- try Shape's "shape your abs" or The firm "jiggle free abs" dvd's instead. By all means, do not waste your money on this one! This dvd is extremely easy, and if you want to lose weight or tone up, you need something more challenging! 
 This is just a biased one sided book, that states that all things wrong to the Shias have done by Sunnis. The author's claim are quite far fetched as to blame all the wrong things that happened to Shia's on Sunnis and their ulterior motives against Shias. However the larger problem that I have with the book is this. This book will only grow more divisions between people in this case muslims. The world doesnot need more dividers. The world needs unifiers who are woroking towards peace, harmony and unification between different faiths and different sub sects.  
 I am about halfway through this book and am about to throw it out. So far, he has gone through a history of the psychology of mothering and fathering and tried to relate personal and client experiences. I didn't want a psychology textbook, I just wanted the author's insite on fatherhood. After reading half the book, the only conclusion he has drawn is that men are more aggressive than women and are different in their parenting styles. I already knew this and didn't need all the psychoanalysis to prove the point.   The organization of the book is awful - it has no chapters. You have no idea what each section is about. It rambles on somewhat aimlessly (at least so far). It is certainly not something you would want as light reading. I would think that only a psychology student or professor would enjoy reading it. I will probably finish the book in the hopes of gaining something that may help me be a better father, but I'm not holding out much hope 
 This is just a BEginner/baby poker book i was expecting a more detailed book.  ** Only buy this if you are a complete Newbie ! This book does the same as any other Beginning poker book.  Buy Harrington on Holdem instead  im curious as to why this book is rated 4 STARS  
 Tamar Myers has too many sidelines in this book. Too much about too many  other characters and not enough attention paid to the real mystery in  question. I found this book an entanglement of Magdelena's relationships  (good and bad ones) and the history connected with each one. This book was  a downer 
 The subject matter is utterly fascinating yet the author has achieved something that is usually hard to do: take a rich and fascinating history of a strange and amazing cult, then bog its story down in tedious and annoying narrative. In otherwords, he may be a good researcher, but as a writer he's piss-poor. WE, the layman public, want to read an account of the Assassin Order, not petty details interlaced with utterly droll wordsmithing.  Goes to show you that whomever published this had their head up their ass. I'm very disappointed. Bypass this one!  
 This book has not been helpful to me in this first few months of loss.  Although it does show similarities people have in their experience of deep grief, it does not offer solutions.  Shakesphere and Poe may have had similar experiences, and may have written about them elloquently, but that doesn't help me today.  I think this book needs to be targeted to a diferent population than those of us who are looking for answers 
 I loved ECW.  So everytime a dvd or book comes out about ECW, I do a double take.  I could write a really long review on this book, but I'll condense it really quickly to save you the time:  1.  Thom Loverro may be a respected and longtime journalist, but he obviously knows nothing about ECW.  He can't even decide if the name is Mike "Nova" Bucci or Mike Nova.  The writing style is drab and reads like someone took a pile of notes and threw them on a page, then made barely-conscious transitions.  2.  It's a dvd rehash.  That was obvious from the beginning but I was hoping it would provide something interesting.  I was wrong.  If you have the dvd there's no point in reading this.  3.  The innacuracies are frustrating.  One would think at least one fact-checking session could have been devoted to this.  Taz is even labeled as Mikey Whipwreck.  Small children, after watching one show featuring the two, could have noticed there's a difference.  I would have given my eyeteeth to recommend this book and I rarely consider reading even the silliest books to be a waste of time, but this really was a waste.  It's sloppy, badly put-together, many times inaccurate and totally devoid of any real passion.  If you really want to read it try to check it out at a library 
 Enlightening discussion of how sexuality and the youth movement in Germany around WWI created a strong sense of nationalis 
 use less than 3 times, the touch screen doesn't work.don't know why~ 
 I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves 
 Yes, actually I do. To warn potential readers from reading the most crappy book in the face of the Earth. Gerald betraying his adored Ellen? Mammy betraying her most loved mistress? Ashley being gay? (Since when is dereaming gayness? And didn't he love Melanie?) Melanie killing a slave out of anger? (This offended me the most, because I have always loved Melanie) Rhett prefering this lame loser wannabe to Scarlett?  It's an insult to GWTW.An insult to Margaret Mitchell. An insult to the south.  Just because some plantations had mullattos doesn't mean everyone had to.  If you have read GWTW, don't let this horrible, disgusting object cheat you out of your time, or your love for one of the most beautiful books of American literature 
 Man I've been too a gang of concerts and car shows throughout the West, and like many other people I hate that trick Noreaga for disrespecting my home TOWN L.A. so no RESPECT 
 This book is a prime example of how ignorant politicians are of the principles upon which this country was founded on and in particular the US Constitution.  One chapter of this book is even called "Reclaiming our constitutional democracy."  Reclaiming our constitutional what?  The US is a Republic, not a democracy.  Our founders loathed mobocracy.  No where in the US Constitution is "democracy" even mentioned, although the Constitution guarantees a republican form of government for every state.  In the introduction, Ted writes that one of the "challenges" is "to provide health care to every American."  Excuse me, where in the Constitution does it say that the Federal Government is to provide health care?  Take a look at the 10th article in the Bill of Rights, Ted.  Health care is not a Federal issue.  So stay out of it.  Another "challenge" is to "restore our basic values."  I wonder what basic values Ted has in mind here (because at this point I could not stomach this tripe anymore and had to put the book away).  Then again, considering this book is written by a man who escaped a manslaughter conviction after leaving a woman to drown in his car, my curiosity over Ted's "basic values" has been abated 
 It was really good at first and I was enjoying it at first. Dee Henderson didn't waist any time in getting the story going but there is just so much in between when the story starts and when the climax starts. I wasn't able to finish the book because I got kind of sick of it. After a while, it's just like, alright, we get. She's falling in love with Adam and he's falling in love with her and praying for her. Thats basically all that happens for the majority of the book. There are so many pointless things going on before even ONE suspence stuff starts. There is a little bit of suspence in it, but you really have to read to get there. I think I might just skip to the end of the book to find out what happens.  So if your looking for a good love story, then this is what you should read, but not if your looking for a thriller that hooks you and makes you want to sleep with the light on 
 I loved these so much at first so cute and had great sound. They seemed to act as earplugs to the world outside and I loved that they didn't fall out like other earbuds. However after a month of use the right ear stopped working and no one would take them back very frustrating. Make sure to buy these from the dealer so that they will take them back with the lifetime guarantee. 
 By the time the book got to the terrible evil lurking in the proposed school yard, I thought that we had been transported to Sunnyvale High.  Tony Hillerman should feel insulted to have this book compared to his; they are a world apart.  Don't waste your time or money - I wish I hadn't 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 I seem to be in the minority here, but this album did very little for me.  There are a few good songs, but overall I think it is weaker than both "Constrictor" and "Raise Your Fist And Yell" 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this "score" was "written", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition.  
 Wow this pitiful attempt is exactly what Ann Coulter has been talking about since "Slander."  Including the belief that showing an unflattering picture of someone actually proves that they're stupid and their ideas are evil.  Clearly all the visceral hatred posing as content is the intellectual and psychological equivalent of putting ones hand over ones ears and chanting "la la la," except it involves a mind boggling level of hatred. Hatred of hearing what you know is true, and thus don't have the means to logically debate.  This necessitates so called "progressives" need to destroy Coulter before her wisdom and insights (which none of these authors could hope to equal) destroy their world and priviliges 
 For heavens sakes, how does a sappy book like this get such glowing reviews!  There are certainly some interesting plotlines and characterizations (although none of them exactly "deep"), and Jones is bold in portraying Polly's life with some stark details.  But most of the story takes place while Polly is about 14-16, and it's asking a lot for an adult to put up with the insipid voice of Polly for so long.  There are some humerous moments, and Jone's entertaining style compels the reader to keep turning the pages, but there's no satisfactory ending that makes you glad to have spent the effort reading it through.  The ending is nothing but sloppy.  It's as if the author spent all this time developing the story at a fairly plodding pace and then was told to finish it in a weekend.  Several reviewers seem to be trying to fill the gaps but frankly there's just a bunch of stuff that has no explanation whatsoever.  The ending has all the satisfaction of a Star Trek episode defeating a robot with "This statement is false", and even that is delivered about as crudely as imaginable.  Jones is better with lighter fare where she can make us laugh our way along and not expect too much of the ending, like "Dark Lord of Derkholm" or "Year of the Griffin".  But she completely overreaches in this one.  I'd have given it 3 stars if it weren't for all the overblown reviews - expectations need to be lowered in this case to counteract the hype.  I do wonder what she could have done if she'd focused more on the ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion, instead of leaving me feeling cheated 
 I am stunned that a book like "Lightning" would sell even one copy.  Mine was given to me, but should have been tossed in the trash instead.  I cannot begin to talk about what is wrong with this book because there is nothing right. Worthless!!!!and pathetic and beyond.  For heaven sake if you are really of fan of Steel's (I find that hard to believe) than check it out of the library, do not waste a dime on this trash. "Lightning" discredits all women and is a sham.  It does not deserve even one star 
  I was disapointed in this book because there is only a few pages written by Harry Houdini. There was also added material that had nothing to do with Houdini.  Not Recomended 
 This was one of the biggest mistakes I've made concerning the installation of my plasma tv on the wall. I only intended to use two of the three shelves and then I only had a DVD player and a HD satellite receiver. The shelves were more than adaquate to hold what I wanted to put on them, but the channel in the back was useless for my two items. I used a HDMI cable for one component and a composite video (5 wires) for the DVD player. The power cords for each wouldn't fit into the channel and the pin wasn't able to be placed at the top.   I wasted the money I spent on it and finally just screwed two of the shelf supports that came with it to studs in the wall and purchased wiremold surface mounted plastic raceways to cover the wires. I'm happy with my solution and it looks Good. If the channer were large enough then this system would be good.  The channel is only big enough for a power cord and speaker wires and nothing else. A BIG Disappointment. Of course once you get it mounted, you can't return it because it's used so you're stuck. Good Luc 
 I'll say this first: I am not a genius, and George Soros probably is. The book presented itself in an interesting Q&A format that made it easy to skip around and jump sections. That being said, it was still a struggle to finish.  I did not like this book because it was hard to understand and mostly discussed Soros' high-level theory on investment strategy. His theory, which Mr. Soros is very passionate about, has something to do with the universe always being out of balance. If you are a finance whiz who thrives in theoretical analysis, or if you are a new age guru curious about a billionaire's spiritual mantra, maybe you will like this book 
 Face is made of cheap plastic - it scratched within an hour of putting it on.  Watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks.  I've been wearing a cheap Casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it.  Other problems include- the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly, for example when I put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat; also, the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive, with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch.  Finally, the watch is very well photographed in the ad, and doesn't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality 
 I love Dave Barry columns. I own books containing his column-collections. I get a "classic" Dave Barry column by email every Monday.   Based on all of the above, I picked this book out. I am still only half way through - the only reason I have not trashed it yet is because I don't like abandoning books midway. Foul language is one - but giving graphic descriptions of bodily functions page after page? Really, is that supposed to be FUNNY?  I haven't laughed for a single "joke" till now. I am writing this review now because I am pretty sure that things are not going to change by the time I get to end of this torture called "Tricky Business". Dave Barry, if you can't do better than this, I really think you should simply stick to writing columns. I still like those 
 While I don't enjoy writing unfavorable reviews, this "book" deserves it. The so-called advice is mostly nonsense. I was hoping for some insight from some industry superstars, but instead I got filler that anyone trying to fill space could have written. This razor thin book has over 50 pages of Real Estate Glossary words and "Power Words and Phrases." Nonsense.  Also, advice like, "The negotiated contract typically goes first to the buyer's and seller's attorneys for review." (page 102)...is total BS. Where oh where did the author get this nugget! Not in the real world, but probably from some other RE advice book she researched that was is also wrong. If you are uncomfortable reviewing real estate contracts for your clients, then maybe you should consider another profession.   Other, much more informative, realistic books on the business of real estate sales that you might consider are: Real Esatate Marketing and Sales Essentials, by Dan Hamilton, or Mastering the Art of Selling Real Estate, by Tom Hopkins 
 I probably might have liked it but it never arrived and I was told it was out of stock when I complained. However it was in stock when I ordered. So I'm not happy 
 This is the 2nd Clevenger book I have read.  I have to say, I did not finish reading the book.  Don't let that fact make you stop reading this yet.  It could save you!  I read more than half of the book and I couldn't read anymore.  Frank is more developed than in the first book.  There are a good number of characters who make a return to the sequel.  The new characters are very interesting as well.  My problem lies with the plot.   Semi spoilers..  I just can't buy the police sending a psychiatrist into a dangerous situation like they did.  And not only did they do that, they did it TWICE!  I can suspend my belief, but I can only do it so many times.  Being a criminal justice major, this probably annoys me more than most people.  To some, this is a minor flaw, but to me, it is key.  It breaks off from reality bigtime in my eyes, and they might as well be flying a dragon in Fantasia while they are at it.    Other than that, the book was enjoyable.  Lucas returns, and boy is he an interesting character now.  Kathy is back.  If you liked the first book, and don't mind the flaw I pointed out, then go for it.  Ablow seems to be growing as an author as I read the books(chronologically) and it is a fun journey. 
 Another reviewer mentioned this already, but there is sex with animals.  Most of the lesbian stories involved women being turned on by dogs or donkeys.  I was pretty disappointed.  I didn't give it 1 star, because I appreciated the work that went into collecting the stories.  It was written in the 70s, so maybe that had something to do with the tone 
 The only thing worse than this movie is its fans.  Haha!  Racism is so funny!  VERY NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICE!!!  Normally, I like good jokes about various races and cultures, but the jokes in this movie are simply tasteless and not funny, and the fact that it's produced by the same company that owns Fox New REALLY doesn't help the case.  Like Da Ali G Show, I just don't get it.  Why do so many idiots eat this s hit up and ask for seconds?  It is literally mindnumbing to try and watch this limey try to be funny with retarded catch phrases, broken English (wow, a foreign immigrant who doesn't speak well; real original douchenozzle!), and anti-semetic comments 
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 When I first got the Portable Dvd player I charged the battery and when I inserted a dvd and after a few minutes it would freeze and skip certain parts of the movie. I tried to restart it and tried other dvds and it kept saying "Wrong Disc". So anyone who is looking to get this Portable dvd player I advice you not to becuase it will cause a lot of problems and its just going to be a waste of money 
 The product description says to match Sony DCR-DVD105, which is completly FALSE. I just got the len and is worthless 
 Don't buy this price increased version.  I doesn't work any better than the $19.95 model.  Plus it uses twice the amount of batteries.  The concept is great, the graphics are great and that's the end of it.  This just like the first plug and play Ms Pacman (which I also bought) and has a joy stick issue.  If the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating.  While playing Ms Pacman which is the ONLY reason I bought these plug and plays Ms Pacman has a mind of her own, turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own.  It's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you're out of control.  It's extremely frustrating.  For as popular as Pacman and Ms Pacman were in their day and still are these plug and plays would sell on that merit alone so take off the games needing the turning action of the joystick 
 Works well enough once your kid can pedal themselves, although both my kids tipped it plenty of times. The steering bar isn't effective.  It has too much give prob from the fact it's designed to collapse.  Plus it doesn't actually steer the bike (some fancier models have this option). The pin to lock the handle bars doesn't always stick.   There are no brakes on this thing.  Good for pushing your kid around when they haven't figured out the concept of pedals.  Dangerous if your kid is old enough to ride themself and goes careening down a hill because they can't stop and don't want to use the Fred Flinstone braking method. Not worth the money, imo 
 DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOY, THE BATTERY IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS TOY. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!! no where in the product discription does it tell you that the 9.6 volt battery is NOT INCLUDED, all it says, is that you will have to purchase a 9 volt battery for the remote. Don't look for the Tyco 9.6 volt battery in a store or on line, because it will be "out of stock". I have been trying to purchase one for  4 months 
 ...Being a new Premiere (and DV) user I picked up little bits and pieces from various sources and just want to learn some topics that are relavent to me, one at a time.  In other words I want to "skip around" topic-wise.  This book is terrible for that.  You open up a chapter that has a title similar to what you want, and right off the bat he is [talking] about the project you were supposidly building up in previous chapters and referring to that.  Also, somehow complex topics are reduced to a few pictures and even fewer words....[In my opinion,]  Adobes "Total Training" tutorials (if you have the $$$) or the "Visual Quickstart" book are much much better 
 Beautiful tv for 31 days.  Samsung sets new standards for lousy customer service.  Initially they told me 7-14 days before someone would call to make an appointment to look at it.  It has been 17 days and the phone hasn't rung.  I live in a major metro area.  Dell, Apple and others set high standards and expectations for customer care.  Stay away from Samsung 
 I bought this book based on the feedback on this page. And although I would not call the book unusable, it has a lot of scope for improvement. The book layout is terrible and there is almost zero cross refrencing in the book itself. Imagine the author does not ask the reader to look in another part of the book for more information. So my verdict is that although the book has good content, it's laid out in a haphazard way 
 I don't write synopsis of the book.  I figure you can look above to see what the plot is.  However this book is awful.  It's supposed to be the bridge between Empire and Return.  I hated Xizor and found him to be a boring villian.  There are MAJOR plot holes and gaps in the book that are hard to understand.  The writing of the book looks like an editor wasn't involved.  I love the expanded universe of Star Wars.  I just can't believe George Lucas let this book slip out like this.  I don't recommend this to anyone but the intense fans that need to have the bridge.  There are too many better books in the Star Wars series 
 If I could, I'd rate these as -5 stars.    I read the reviews, and decided to try these for myself.  During the first wash,the sheets shrank a little bit for a snug fit on the mattress.  What was really disappointing was how SMALL the pillowcases became, short by a good 5 inches.  They NEVER completely covered our standard pillows.  During the second wash, the sheets shrank EVEN MORE.  It took us a good 10 minutes to wiggle the fitted sheet onto our mattress.  Don't even get me started on how small the pillow cases became after the second wash.  Now, as far as pilling, it took a couple of months, but they have become extremely rough.  They look extremely ratty and the sheets are only 2 months old.  My OLD sheets were nicer, but no longer fit on the (new) thicker mattress.  I will NEVER BUY WAMSUTTA sheets again.  Don't waste your money.  We are extremely disappointed customers 
 This story is full of surprises, which really made me want to keep reading. In one point of the story Palmer tells the "gang" that he does not want to become a wringer. This surprised me greatly because I thought that Palmer would become a wringer so he could keep his friends. I learned to always show your feelings and don't do something that you don't want to do just to get friends. I recommend this Fiction-Horror genre to readers of all ages.   
 If you like the newly built McMansion-styled homes, then this is the book for you.  If you are looking for authentic French decor and tips, don't buy this book.  This is no more "unmistakably French" than la Madeline food is to French cuisine 
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 On our recent road trip, my girlfriend and I brought along some audio books to help us stay awake. Both were historical fiction set in ancient Greece. Sappho's Leap was read by the author, and her mangled pronunciations and over-dramatic tone may have influenced my reaction, but I don't think so.  Unlike Thermopylae, the subject of Gates of Fire (review coming soon), virtually nothing about Sappho is known, Ms. Jong was free to make up just about any story she liked. And she did. Sappho's Leap is a sappy love story with a long interlude where Jong basically plagiarizes Homer, only watering him down to speed the plot. Further, and to make matters worse, Sappho's Leap is not very well-written. It is melodramatic, banal, and overly adjectival. It reads like syrup. Jong apparently can't think of a word for vagina other than "delta" and nothing for penis other than "phallus," which words are like comedy catchphrases by the end of the novel.  The book starts out well. Sappho has climbed a cliff, but pauses to reflect on the story of her life (in media res, like every Greek story). She starts at the beginning, relating how she runs away from hom with Alceous, a famous Lesbian singer. They are exiled from Lesbos for trying to overthrow its tyrant, and her adventures begin. She is married off to a paunchy lush who lives in Syracuse, although pregnant with Alceous's child, to be named Cleis (mispronounced by Jong). When her husband dies, the adventure begins in earnest. After a stay in Egypt, Sappho takes off with the fabulist, Aesop, for Delphi, but is frequently sidetracked along the way. Jong sends Sappho to the Amazons on Crete (?!?) where she causes the return of Pegasus, the island of the centaurs, the underworld, Medusa's sister, etc. In an age where the Greeks occupied the majority of the Mediterranean, Sappho manages to elude everyone for a space of ten years or more, which occupy maybe four chapters of the book.  These adventures are trite, simplified copies of the Odyssey, and add almost nothing to the plot. Nothing really improves from there. Once Sappho returns to the land of the real, Jong wraps things up quickly and predictably. The novel ends with a syrupy, happy ending. Sappho and all her lovers and friends end up living on another random island with her friends, until her daughter sails up with her grandchildren. Ugh.  And don't get me started on the "poems" at the end.  This was my first Erica Jong book, and I think it will be my last. It gets two stars only because I need a lower rung for truly pulp romance, which this book just barely isn't 
 I have listened to this cd many times and every time I listen to the single it just makes me mad.  The album version is a lot better and I wonder why Moby would want join forces with Gwen.  The cd's version is unbelievable and I was happy to hear it become a single.  I did not like Moby teaming with Gwen.  Buy the cd and see how much better Moby as an artist.  The music is much better and worth the money 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 The title of the book is completely misleading. Actually the book vacillates between a mechanic description of kabbalah tree, an interpretation of a painting, Jewish alphabet and various religious points of view. At the end, the reader is left with some information which by no means will lead him/her to an inner balance. This is a purely theoretic book and has nothing to do with spiritual growth 
 I bought this movie soley because it was a "Peter Jackson". While I found it intersesting and well filmed, it's not a movie that I will ever bother watching again. The limitation of this movie is, that it's a true story. The sureal lives of the characters are well portrayed, but the conclusion is abrupt and, while not graphic, is still sickening, especially when you know that people can behave like that and be out of prison within five years! If it was a work of fiction, maybe the girls would have been hanged and therefore given the viewer a sense of satisfaction. But, as they say, truth is stranger than fiction 
 I brought this book a while back and was not happy with it, lucky for amazon I'm a lazy person when it comes to returning things, especially onine. The photos are poor, they look like someone used a compact camera to take the shot, and with no artistic or creative skill either.   There are maybe a few pictures which may be considered close to pro level but as a non pro myself I can already acheive better quality pictures. i expected more than this, there was no depth to the pictures on how they were designed or envisioned by the photographer, just a bunch of random pictures 
  I usually use Adaware to scan my computer weekly, and like others, I would like to try the trial version Spyware Doctor to scan my computer. The result was, I had more than 200 infections! I was amazed that my other virus scan programs didn't catch any of these infections, and my computer had been running properly. Of coz, I would like to remove these infections and so I paid with my creditcard and got the License No.   After entering the License No. and Scanning, I continued to remove the infections that spyware doctor had caught. Before clickinig the remove button,I checked what I would delete and the files SEEMS OK to be deleted.  I had to restart my computer in order to complete removing the infections. I clicked YES to restart.  From then, my nightmare began, I couldn't start my computer AT ALL!!! Not even displaying the loggin window! My computer just kept restarting again and again.  After 5 times restarting automatically, I smelled something burning from my computer!!! I was so scared becoz there are some important files that i haven't backup yet!   Endup, I reformat my computer!!! I couldn't login my old account again! Now, I have a new administrator account and lost all the softwares that i orginally have. Luckily I was able to reinstall 70% of the softwares (you gotta know the serial no. for most of the softwares are not working after reinstall, and that took me long time to find ways reinstalling them, and NOT all of them!) Some of my important files couldn't be opened again because I don't have the softwares to open them!   I was/am still so mad about this! The spyware doctor removed my system operating files and that's why i couldn't restart my computer. Yet, i reinstalled spyware doctor again because I paid and only used it once. However, I couldn't use it after reinstalling like other softwares.  Even i followed the instruction online to reenter the licence no. that i purchased, it's just simply not working (the website said i don't have to repurchase and it should work!)  So i Paid $10 , only used the spyware doctor once, but I lost all other softwares that cost totally more than $400 
 But for example they fail to mention a major concept too soon, like setting your first DB to be copied MANUALLY to your project, not to copy from source.  If you take their advice, you will wind up with a project which wont allow you to update the database.  And to resolve this, I had to use another book.  I emailed the author and tried the forums, several weeks ago, but have not gotten any response.    So, if you are looking for some support, don't get this book 
 The original "Froggy Gets Dressed" book was extremely clever. But this book is the weakest brand extension since Lego clothing. It includes the basic Froggy elements (sound effects starting with z, authority figures yelling "FRROOGGYY", and our noble protagonist turning more red than green) but you have to wonder when the most original part of the story is Froggy picking his nose. Of course, if your child likes Froggy and likes soccer they will love the book, but I wish the authors had put a bit more effort into it 
 The Jerky seemed to be old and hard and was too tough to chew. It also was a little Bland for me. I did like the peppered Jerky much better 
 This was my first Deaver book...and my last.  The suspense factor was "ok", but the sections on scuba were ridiculous.  A diver (with only 25 logged Caribbean clear-water dives) goes into a new NY/NJ wreck, alone (no dive buddy), on a single tank.  And the Coast Guard approves this dive...laughable.  Then once in the wreck, the diver goes down a dumbwaiter passageway measuring 2' by 2', without taking off any gear!!!    You might ask why I point this out...The above was 2 chapters, not just some passing reference, a very material piece of the story.  If this one section [which I know something about] is that outlandish, what does that say for the other sections that I'm not as informed about.  Complete Science Fiction!!!  You are better off reading tea leaves than this book. 
 This is one of the few books so bad that I couldn't finish it.  There is no explanation of how things work,or in many cases what they really are.  I feel like the only motivation for any of the characters was greed, sex, or guilt about greed and sex.  Do not bother with this book 
 My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills.  Well, it did not control odor.  The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week.  The odor escaped even when the pail was closed.  You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.  I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.    Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.  I would not recommend this product 
 First off anybody who knows anythying about poker will tell you chris moneyfaker is a lucky FLUKE in the world of poker. If you actually watched the 2003 WSOP which i did you will see the definition of RIVERRAT is chris moneyfaker.  He caught every lucky card on the turn and the river and should have been elimanated early like the scrub he is.  Even the announcers in 2005 refer to him a a fluke. I did not read this book because i have been playing NL HOLD'EM for many years and can say for a fact that i'm a better player then the lucky loser and i real books like SKLANSKY'S THE THEORY OF POKER OR BRUNSON'S SUPER SYSTEM these are books written by the real deals not some SCRUB AS* LOSER who catches lucky cards.  I will end this review by saying anyone who actually thinks chris moneyfaker is a real poker player knows nothing about poker and trust me ten years from now see how many WSOP BRACELETS this fake lucky loser has.  Guarantee it wont be 9 or 10 like doyle brunson,phill helmuth or johhny chan have who actually know how to play the game.  The only reason this book was written is to profit of IDIOTS who Don't know how to play poker and hope to win the WSOP one day by PURE LUCK AND finally move out of there trailer 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 This book is rampant with gramatical and typographical errors. For example, on page 42 there are two errors alone. The gramatical errors are forgiveable, but when the recipe calls for "1/4" of something, you are sometimes left to wonder if that 1/4 is a teaspoon, cup, gallon, who knows.  On a positive note, there is at least a wide variety of recipes. 
 Daniel Martin is in love with his vision of the world but in all honesty he is so self-absorbed that all of these experiences seem trivial and removed.And the female characters are like soulless machines,used for pleasure and then written off.I was waiting for a smartass kid to come along and make fun of Daniel Martin's brazen attitude or at least his shoes 
 Others have written many of the same words I would have used so I will be brief. I grabbed this book based on a mention from John Grogan in the Marley book. Katz is not nearly as pure of a dog owner. He seems to take pleasure in recounting his practiced dominance over his dogs. He claims to adore them but uses force and physical punishment while explaining how lucky they are to have him. In my mind, the dogs seem like experiments. This book is more about Katz than it is about the dogs. A lot of ego on display. I didn't come away with warm regard for the author. 
 Let me clue you in, just in case you're of the uninitiated - Warren Ellis hates superheroes. Warren Ellis hates writing super hero comics; or as he calls them, Fight Comics. Warren Ellis' disdain for the genre shows bright and clear through this collection of the already amazingly bland Ultimate Fantastic Four. The ship not even Bendis could save, this series has been genuinely bad since day one. Warren Ellis took the book over as what he said was "a favor" to his friends Bendis and Millar who both left the book to pursue other writing endeavors.   Granted, its not ALL bad, hence the two stars. Some of the dialogue is funny (example: Reid asking The Thing if he can still go to the bathroom and Ben Grimm's reaction to the question, though the layout of the panels is really what makes it funny as you as a reader can see the awkward silence) and the art is TOP NOTCH. Stuart Immonen is amazing, and as soon as Marvel keeps him on Ultimate books, I feel his talent is wasted.   All in all, I'd say skip this book and check out The Ultimates, which is the Ultimate universe's Avengers, and is pretty much the  best book of the entire Ultimate line, though fans of Spider-Man might disagree. If you want to see Warren Elllis write superheroes he actually cared about, go check out The Authority. 
 After reading several books about the Founding Fathers and other Presidents, I was excited to read about Teddy.  Now in most books they discuss personalities, events, and impacts of decisions.  This book read like a cheesy novel with unncessary flowery language.  There are lines that were shown as dialogue, when the information was probably gleened from several correspondence.  He writes about facial expressions during conversations.  Morris even wrote about what they thought during events.  Most writers would state, "He would recall later..."  If I had wanted to read a novel, I would have.  I was disappointed not with the subject, just the way it was written.   
 Poor lady, in our house, sits relegated to the corner of the play room.  For some reason, this is not one of my son's favorite engines...he has so many to pick from, and she never gets chosen to haul the other coaches... 
 I love the Bears. It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.  As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.  After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.  With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store.  1/ 
 This book is fun for people who want to read a work of total fiction. However, for people who care about accuracy it is full of misinformation that does a disservice to readers who don't know any better. The sad thing is that there is good data out there, lots of it, especially on the Maya see Linda Schele's and David Fredel's "Maya Cosmos" and Barbara Tedlock's "Time and the Highland Maya," for example. Why do people who should know better write such stuff? And, perhaps more importantly why does anyone publish it? 
 An email list that I am on recommended this book so I bought it.  I read it twice, everything seemed logical and I decided to finally make the leap into raw food.  Everyone said it was so easy.  I fed my Irish Setter 1/2 of a whole chicken and thought it was a good idea.  Lonsdale says we should feed big pieces and that's what was available to me.  Well, let me tell you, it was a BAD idea.  My Setter tore into the chicken with gusto and I was so pleased with myself - until she started running round in circles screaming in pain.  Apparently a bone became lodged between 2 of her teeth and was puncturing the roof of her mouth.  So we raced off to the emergency clinic where my dog ultimately ended up spending 3 nights at a total cost of $2500.  I cannot believe what I did to my dog based on what was in this book.  I do believe in raw food but never again will I feed whole carcasses or any bone that's not ground.  It's not worth it to me or my dog.  Needless to say, there is only one word to sum up the advice in this book: BAD.

 This is simply a rehash of Dr. Burns previous writings. If you have read Feeling Good, it is a waste of money to purchase this book. He covers the same material but change the names the scenerios. He is a one trick pony and clearly has done no more recent research , since the prior books 
 I thought this book was totally mean-spirited and filled with sadism that would certainly scare any child.  In fact, I believe that there is little, if anything, positive to say about this book.  Children look up to the adults in their lives, especially to their teachers, and this book portrays the teacher as cruel and nasty. This book was deeply disturbing for both myself and more importantly, for my son 
 I loved this blender while it was working.  I mostly used it to make smoothies with frozen fruit.  I love that it has seamless buttons so food can't get caught in little cracks.  I rarely used the food processor.  After about 11 months, mine also started to smell like it was catching fire - however, it was the black piece in the bottom of the blending jar, which was basically being "Shaved" by the base motor.  I had to order a replacement "blender cutting assembly" from the Cuisinart website for $15 with shipping, only to have it happen again.  Plus, it was a pain to clean - the base threading didn't match up well with the jar and screwing and unscrewing the base was often difficult.  We've replaced the blender with another brand but I have kept the bottom motor part for the processor 
 Amazon did not disclose that this is a blank note book. this is VERY WRONG. Now I have to go to the trouble of returning it. And in TOP OF THAT, I was alerted by an e-mail to pre-order it, leading me to believe this was a new book...!!!  Why is Amazon resorting to such methods?? 
 I started this book full of high hopes.  I too, am Italian-American and grew up in the northeast.  The synopsis of the book was quite promising - an Italian American woman who falls in love with a Jewish Man - a union not all that common in the New York/New England regions.  But when I got into the book, I started noticing that I didn't really care about the characters.  Rosa, the female protagonist, who the author wants so much to be our heroine is never all that likable.  Nothing about her character or personality ever endears her to the reader.  The male lead, Gary, who Ciresi wants so bad to portray as a great catch, complete with a kind heart and great sense of humor, comes across as boorish and obnoxious.  The supporting cast, namely the families of the two leads, don't have a memorable trait between them.  I found Ciresi's portrayal of the Italian family of Rosa to be completely offensive and insulting.  And by the way, note to Ms. Ciresi, if you are trying to portray these people as Italian immigrants, please correct the spelling and grammar of the Italian words you mix in the dialouge.  There are countless offensive stereotypes of both Jews and Italians, and Ms. Ciresi doesn't leave out the Catholics either. Plenty of material to offend them in there too.  All in all, if you are looking for good Italian-American literature, I would suggest that you look elsewhere 
 I AM PRETTY EASY TO PLEASE WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES.LOW BUDGET,HIGH BUDGET,DOESN'T MATTER.THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY 45 YEARS OF VIEWING.WAS TOTALLY NOT BELIEVABLE AND THE WRITING AND DIRECTING WAS SHABBY AT BEST.DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED BUCKS ON THIS LEMON!!!! 
 My title for this review says it in a nutshell. One star for being reasonably well written/edited. But, why are some of these authors so intent on trying to defame Jefferson by twisting history the way Jefferson's original slanderer, Callender, did? It is certainly not good objective history. I would not want to lead any young reader down the wrong path with this revisionist history based on weak, weak opinion and speculation 
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment 
 Wood leads us into the woods, leaving fact and reality behind.  His book, like his 'documentary', leverages all of the latest and greatest speculation into a miraculous and utterly fictional portrait. He would do well to read Schoenbaum, not to mention Price. As entertainment, a 'C'. As biography, an 'F' 
 My daughter is almost three, and she was so excited when she received this for Christmas.  Unfortunately, the strings do not work, and also the star buttons are supposed to play notes and/or chords, and they don't work, either.  I was going to send for a replacement because my daugher absolutely loves this, and I was so disappointed when Amazon responded there are no replacements available.  I'm going to see if the manufacturer can replace it 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 the first 50 pages are good and explore interesting philosophical concepts, based upon Robert Ringer's life. The rest of the book is frankly mediocre. We do live in a different world indeed, and its seems that the "turtoise" has a hard time dealing with it 
 I am a voracious reader with some knowledge of art history, but after attempting to read this book for the last six months, I am finally stopping at the half-way mark.  It is certainly full of new facts and demonstrates an exhaustive amount of research, but I find Sweetman's narrative plodding and unorganized.  Also, the book pre-supposes the reader's depth of knowledge on the subject -- the lack of which is quite obviously my problem in enjoying the book 
 my 2 1/2 year was interested in this seat right away, much more so than his small potty. However, he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard. He gets wet, the floor and his step stool are all wet. Clean up is a nightmare. It's in the trash now. 
 The author of this was toted to be an upcoming and compared too... what.  It is well written, but the plot, action and premises of this is yet to "get to me".  As to "..... Are we  there yet?"  I still have yet to figure out what it has to do with the story of the book. 
 "Battle" appears to be written as a direct challenge to Victor Davis Hanson and John Keegan, two of the world's best known military and classical historians.  Dr. Lynn's book is well written and well organized, and provides a fascinating overview of his thesis on how cultural discourse affects the waging of war by societies.  He aggressively asserts that there is no "Western" (or other non-Western) Way of War, rather that each culture's interpritation of war and battle shapes its values and how it fights its wars.  His work deserves great consideration, but I will not go so far to say that he necessarily "disproves" the analysis put forward by Hanson or Keegan.  Regrettably, his book would receive more stars were it not for his Epilogue concerning the War on Terrorism.  The Epilogue reads more like a treatise from the editorial pages of the New York Times and less like a sober understanding of the challenges this unique War presents.  His choice of source material for the Epilogue includes Maureen Dowd, Richard Clark and Gen. Anthony Zini.  Dowd cannot be taken seriously, and Clark has been thoroughly discredited.  Zini is in the mold of Gen. Wesley Clark.  By stepping in to this highly politicized debate and adopting the positions of those so firmly on the Left, it undercuts my opinion of his otherwise interesting and informative work.  However, it deserves to be read by those who share Hanson's and Keegan's analysis, as it is a worthy challenge 
 This book may seem like a great intro book to those well-versed in Telecommunications. However, the book does a terrible job of explaining terms and jargon. A word, for example, will be used for several pages before being defined. There are very few practical examples and metaphors to illustrate concepts and add interest to the book. There are no photographs here either, only basic illustrations which do not clarify concepts, but instead require explaination.  All of my classmates are disgusted that we are required to use this text. Plans are being set for a post-semester Essential-Guide-to-Telecommunications bonfire 
 I loved Aries Spears' other release, "I ain't scared" so I bought this.  Don't.  There's less than half an hour of material and almost none of it is funny.  Spears' does his great imitations of DMX, LL cool J, etc. but they are not funny.  There are just a few poor quality recordings of sessions with Spears on a radio show pretending to be a rap star and tricking callers into auditioning their music and a couple of recordings where Spears calls into a radio show pretending to be a rap star.   This release would be tolerable as a bonus track for a comedy CD but is totally unacceptable as a stand alone release.  Save your money and avoid!! 
 It's time to retire this old book which is amazingly rigid in its decorating ideas and its school-marmish, rules-oriented approach to design. Decorating today is so personal, yet Martha (or this old book, anyway) seems to think that there is only one way to do things. It reminds me of a 1950s book filled with rules for the little housewife to follow, but it certainly doesn't fit the world of today's educated, style-conscious, and confident consumer. Bleah 
 Such a sad sequel to the best video game movie. Mortal Kombat: Anilhilation was anihilated the day it was made. The story was poorly done. I didn't like how the characters act in this film. Jax {Williams} acts like a afician-american stereotype. Sonya {Hess} acts like a weak little bitch. Sindel {Vander} acts like one of those pathetic villianess you see in those direct-to-video films that have dumb villianess. And Brian Thompson should be a shame of himself, such a good character actor playing a pethetic Shao Khan.  One thing that sucks in this film is that Radien {Remar} and Shao Kahn are brothers and Shinnok {Schore} is their father. What a pathetic change to add in this film. Raiden and Kahn are far from family and Shinnok and Kahn don't even like each other...and they're not father and son in the game.  This film cost $30 million, yet the special effects in this film look so cartoony. In fact, I've seen Playstation One graphics look better than that.   This film is really bland, and John R. Leonetti directing style sucks.  If you wanna watch a sequel to Mortal Kombat, just watch yourself playing Mortal Kombat 2 on Midway's Arcade Greatest Hits 2 on Playstation 2 and XBOX 
 If you want a Jan Karon Book with adultery, gays, and  anti Christian values,  read this series! Jan Medlicott has "modernized" the Mitford series-but included "familiar things" such as a sweet red haired boy character and drawn sketches of the town of Covington for examples-right out of Mitford-- there are so many similarities that I wonder how she "got away with it"!  Come back Jan Karon 
 Since so many popular chick-literature focuses on the privileged, glamorous lives of beautiful Manhattanites, I was curious to read this book which focuses instead on the lifestyle of women in Hollywood and suburban New Jersey (especially since I am former New Yorker, who lives in the New York suburbs and works in the New Jersey suburbs).    However, I was left disappointed and annoyed.  Compared to other popular chick-lit, the author's characters are fully-dimensional and likeable (compared to say Plum Sykes' inanely vapid and selfish characters in Bergdorf Blondes). It was for this reason that I finished the book, and other readers will want to as well, since the author excels at making the reader care about the characters.  However, advertised as a book about "friendship", this book is no different than any of the NYC-center chic-lit narratives which center on a have v. have not lifestyle. The problem being that in works such as "The Devil Wears Prada" or "The Ivy Chronicles" which are a humorous look at the lives of the haves, they make no particular moral statement about the class differentials of the have-nots.   Suburbanistas, on the other hand is infused with a subtle brand of class issues, and populist, democratic socialism and anti-corporate message which in my opinion has no place in chic-lit. What makes this subtle moralistic message annoying, is that in the end the glamorous, thin, beautiful woman from Hollywood continues to be fabulous and continue her acting on Broadway, while there is no Cinderella ending for her childhood friend from New Jersey. Since the author took it upon herself to promote a socially democratic message throughout the book, suggesting that at the end, both characters will achieve equality, to end the book with this obvious contraction is frustrating and annoying.  
 Stupid story line, silly characters and so predictable...what did I miss that all of the other reviewers found so earth-shattering????  It was slightly entertaining but basically a waste of time.  When it finally came to an end I had no emotional response except that I was glad I was finished.  I don't know what else to say except don't bother with it.  There are LOTS of great books out there and this isn't one of them.  I kept reading it because of all the wonderful reviews, and thought it MUST get better once I got into it...NOT!!!  I guess I really missed something here, but for the life of me I can't imagine what it was!!??  I am a fanatic reader of ALL types of writing styles but this one just soared right past me.  Don't bother with it 
 Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music. 
 The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many. 
 This text is an easy read, and you will understand the reactions that are given in the text examples. So why the low rating? Organic chemistry is all about "prediction". And when it comes to teaching you how to predict the outcomes of reactions you've never seen before, it is lacking! You can study this text two hours a day, every day, and unless you have an uncanny ability to understand chemistry (I don't)--you will still not have this most fundamental skill you need to succeed.  Try "Organic Chemistry as a Second Language" and "Organic Chemistry II as a Second Language".  They will have you predicting and understanding Orgo in no time!! This course isn't hard at all- once someone explains it to you properly. David Klein (the author of those two books) does that beautifully 
 I am not often motivated to rate books, but this one annoyed me.  It is dull, repetitive, disorganized and discouraging.  As another reviewer noted, I guess I just didn't get the joke.  Don't buy it unless you want to be bored and depressed 
 Too hard to follow the instructions . I bought it for my mom who said she could not tell the difference. I am not sure she followed the instructions.I am just assuming  (she is an English Professor )it didnt work too well. 
 I ordered this book for my 3 year old nephew and was surprised to receive a book without any words. I think in the description of the book, rather than saying "English", it should say picture book.  I am a fan of Mercer Mayer but preferred to buy one that this little boy could grow into in his reading 
 The best of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book stories took place in the man village because that's where Mowgli meets a superstitious old hunter named Buldeo.   Buldeo claims that the tiger Shere Khan is supernatural,  the ghost of a wicked old money lender.  When Mowgli says that Shere Khan is only a very disagreeable tiger Buldeo threatens to spank our young hero.    When Buldeo learns that Mowgli has a vendetta with the tiger and a black panther as his personal body guard the old man tells the other villagers that Mowgli is a demon child who is able to turn himself from a boy to a wolf, and back to a boy at will.  This is great story telling.  But where is Buldeo?  He isn't in the movie at all!  It's like leaving the Wicked Witch out of the movie version of "The Wizard of Oz".  On a side note, in the Kipling stories the black panther Bagheera has a secret so shameful he can tell no one but Mowgli.   Bagheera was born in a zoo, chained and keep in a cage for the amusement of men.  But rather than blame Mowgli for the cruelty he suffered in captivity Bagheera sees the boy as a kindred spirit.  They were both separated from their own kind at an early age.  Once we have that bit of information the relationship between the boy and the panther makes sense.   We are able to understand Bagheera's total devotion to the Mowgli.  But the movie never explains that.  I realize that the movie shouldn't follow the book completely.   But since the book was so much richer the movie seemed like a let down 
 First off, I subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years, and enjoyed it. But the "main guy" Robert Kennedy, is someone who offends me both personally and politically. He assumes that every girl/women reading that magazine is tiny. For his information, some of us work out 5-6 days a week and eat well, and are still heavy-set. His comments on heavy-set people are offensive, thoughtless, and sometimes even downright cruel. Nonetheless, the pictures/articles were inspiring to me, and it is a decent fitness magazine 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  The characters were boring, the plot was trite, and the writing was colorless.  I cringe to consider the sequel.  I definitely did not read the same book that Ursula K. LeGuin reviewed - her blurb on the cover was more interesting than anything that occurred inside the book.  The only bright note was the cover art [July 2006 paperback] 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 The Prisoner of Azkaban  Young Harry suffers as an adopted child and family servant. An insulting relative is blown away, and Harry leaves too. A magic bus takes him away. The special effects are extravagant, but seem senseless. The oddities are like something out of "Star Wars", amazing but irrelevant. The `Hogwarts' school seems to be overproducing the amount of wizards needed for their economy. Or do they have a short life in their future? Great power may create great faults.  The computer generated images are what makes this film interesting. The hippogriff looks great! Let's hope it doesn't drop anything on the students. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, where they keep the wizards who have gone bad. Black is said to be going after Harry Potter! This time we see the game of quidditch played in the rain. The winter scene and the invisible Potter recalls "The Invisible Man". Overall there is a creepy feeling to the adult characters in this film. The story begins to drag in the middle, but a big black dog shows up to drag Ron into his underground lair. A tree comes to life and attacks Harry and Hermione. Then they find a secret tunnel that leads to the castle and a surprising revelation. [Does any of this make sense to you?]  Special effects are no substitute for a good story. It seems confused and meaningless. Can the wing loading of a hippogriff support three people? All seems to end well given the prior events. Professor Lupin resigns, his secret life-style has been found out and the parents of his students won't approve of this behavior. Parents don't like a teacher who exploits the students. "Harry Potter" panders to children in giving superhuman powers to a select few who aren't fit to handle these powers. Or is this a subtle criticism of the aristocratic ruling class? 
 I was looking forward to this, but it is unreadable. You will cringe at what feels like a smug and pompous college student's first essay 
 I thought this book was a learning tool of all the famous artists. Instead it was how to learn to do art like the masters, which for a two year old is a little advanced. So it wasn't what I was hoping for. 
 This EP is emblematic of the way Radiohead frustrates me. I know so many smart people who like this band, yet Radiohead just doesn't do a thing for me (at least their material from "OK Computer" onward). I mentioned this to a friend of mine back about four years ago, and she suggested that I listen to "My Iron Lung".  The EP showcases the band's strengths (the occasional understanding of interesting musical dynamics) and their worst flaws - primarily their unbelievable self-importance. With every blazing strum of electric guitar, with every howl from Thom Yorke, it seems that the band is trying to tear down the world and build it back up on their own terms. Which is not problematic on its own; the conflict comes with the band's refusal to directly, accessibly communicate their meaning.  That said, there are some good songs. In particular, the melody of the title track hints at the band's potential for interesting songwriting. "Permanent Daylight" has an interesting sound, but a lyric that just drips with condescension: "The easiest way to sell your soul is to carry on believing that we don't exist / It must be hard with your head on backwards". It's all undermined by a terrible acoustic version of the band's best song to date, "Creep" 
 Start off with the bad news.  I have a Motorola DVR / Converter box with my Comcast cable service, and the Comcast remote sends the ADS box into gonzo fits.  Attempting to use the menu button on the cable remote causes the ADS box to switch inputs.  Using the cable DVR fast-forward button cycles the ADS through screen formats with each button push, etc.  I contacted ADS tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time.   Obviously, this is not acceptable.  Too bad because this box does a much better job than my Philips Cineos at upscaling.  Tivo, analog cable, DVD, Laserdisc all look better.  The improvement is more than worth the hassle of having another remote to handle, but definitely not worth it if you have a Motorola cable box that will conflict.  5 stars for video quality, 3 stars for user interface (which is not so great), subtract all but 1 star for failure to publicise conflict and for failure to solve conflict.  
 Briefly looking through this book you can quickly see that it is not a technical design book.   It does a very nice job at praising various popular magazines, and it does highlight fundamental design practices within magazine design.  It is a good overview book. It is also a good book to see many images of successful magazines without having to hunt down various magazines.  However, the problem is the book does not going into the technical process of magazine layout. Magazine layout IS a very technical process that most books don't explain. There is much about the grid - it is extremely important and very under estimated. It is also more simple than most people would think. There is also much about magazine layout and structure this book will not cover. Also about the whole process, from layout to print. There are a MILLION questions and problems that pop-up while designing a magazine. Many considerations and variables that vary. This book does not bring up any of those.  Can you design a magazine after reading this book? No. Can you evaluate and understand magazines better after reading this book? Yes. Can you get a feeling for what magazine design is about after reading this book? Yes. Can you get some great ideas out of this book? Yes. ...you can also get them by looking through quality magazines 
 This has been a nightmare. When I received the chair I couldn't wait to put it together. However the holes for the screws were too big and therefore I was unable to secure the pieces. I called and asked if the  the right size screws could be sent. I was told that there were no provisions for that, but they would be happy to send me another one.   (I could return the faulty one in that box.) Very nice I thought. Well I got the second one. THE SCREWS ARE TOO SMALL FOR THE HOLES! Now I am stuck with chair parts all over the house and no chair to sit on! I don't recommend this item 
 This book proved a great disappointment. It contains nothing new, and completely fails to interpret either Daniel or Revelation. The author comes across as blinkered, bigotted and arrogant - a self-satisfied member of the 'elite' who gives the impression he will spend eternity smirking from his guaranteed high place in heaven at the rest of us, who will presumably be burning in hell! He is mistaken in thinking Daniel and Revelation only have any meaning for the present generation - didn't they have any meaning to those for whom they were originally written? His theology appears limited and narrow-minded. Don't waste your money on this book. A more scholarly and balanced view of eschatology is given in Craig C. Hill's book 'In God's Time' 
 A high school guidance counselor could write a better job hunting book then this! Dr. Mornell has so little to say he resorted to using a huge 14 pt type font so he could fill up 187 pages.   His best answer for the standard "What are your five-year goals?" is " You can evaluate my work in three, six, or twelve months - and if it's excellent, we can decided how to best use my talents within the company." In my opinion this answer is vague and shows the job candidate has no ambition, no incentive to take ownership of his career, no plan and no sense of direction.   If you are serious about finding a job, order "Knock 'em Dead 2001" by Martin Yale and get serious answers from a pro on really tough interview questions 
 My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event! 
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 Dr. Gary Almy charged with child molestation.  I personally worked with this man.  I saw his questionable actions with boys in his care, and unethical admistering of drugs.  Hopefully through proper counsling and support, more boys will have the strength to come forward in the future against Dr. Almy.  He deserves more than 7yrs, because the boys he molested with have to live with it the rest of their lives 
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 Woods accepts uncritically the rather paradoxical view that there is an arena of human action (economics)exmempt from the moral order. This implies that it is also exempt from Church teachings. Thus, for Woods, it is the Church and not the market that is problematic. The market, for Woods, moves according to its own logic, just as the stars do; it is a pure science on the order of physcis or astronomy. However, the view that men are moved in the same way as are the stars is more akin to astrology than astronomy.   The traditional view that prevailed from Aristotle to Smith was that all human relationships, including economic ones, were regulated by justice. Justice, for Aristotle and St. Thomas, was not merely a "Part of virtue, but virtue entire." Hence there can be no human relationships outside its realm. To posit an order of relationships beyond justice is to subscribe, consciously or not, to the doctrine of the double truth. Just as in the 13th century, those who subscribe to this doctrine reject the authority of the Church, or indeed any authority at all.  Woods is truly unprepared for his task, with only a rudimentary knowledge of economics, mainly gleaned from the pretensions of "praxeology," a philosophy so flawed that only an economist could take it seriously. (Economists are generally the most poorly trained and least well-read of all the academics.) But Woods is an historian, and should have used his training in this area to examine the question. Had he done so, he would have discovered that the system he longs for existed in the 19th and early 20th century. The economy was, during that period, very nearly laissez-faire, with the government not even 1/10th as involved as it is today. The system was also highly unstable and inequitable, subject to ever increasing cycles of economic euphoria and depression, culminating in the Great Depression that very nearly brought the system down. Only massive government redistribution, starting after World War II, could given the system any stability. Now this intervention itself has become problematic, resulting in debts that cannot be sustained.  We have been where Woods would have us go; we did not like it. The truth of the matter is that economic Austria and social chaos share a border, and you cannot draw near to the one without coming close to the other. If justice is one thing and economics another, then there can be no just systems, and society is condemened to being a war of all against all. A little history would have saved the historian from great errors. And a little humility would not have hurt, either; if one is going to be a dissenter, it would be a good idea to have a better idea of the teaching one is dissenting from. Woods has neither history, nor humility, nor economics, nor justice. Without justice, there can be no stable social order 
 This book was a very interesting . It had you suspenced and at the edge of your seat. It had you thinkiing what would you do if you were really invisible .What kind of chaos would ypu stir up. This book was good but it started to get   a little boring . That's why I gave it only 3 stars. the movies was much better  
 Instead of being titled "property and freedom," it should be titled "property and power." Pipes was a prominent old cold-war apologist for American capitalism, and you can tell that he is still trapped in his little world of false-dichotomy.   Pipes overall argument is contrived, and with the exception of his knowledge of Russian history, superficial. Most of his time is spent criticizing the Stalinist Soviet Union, while at the same time lacking any thoughtful rebuttal to Marx's critique of capitalism.  His title claim, that freedom cannot exist without private property, is weak philosophically and logically. He has poor insight into the nature of freedom and presonal responsibilty. He would really benefit by reading some Sartre or Nietzche, before trying to describe his own made up idea freedom. His attempts to link economic thought with philosophy and history fail miserably. He barely exposes the actual writings of Marx. This is incredibly unfortuante since most "real-world" capitalists, such as wealthy Wall street brokers, know that Marx understood capitalism better than any of its supporters. His philosophical support is all anecdotal with no real thoughtful analysis. His historical summary, although detailed with Russia, leaves much to be desired. He fails to discuss slavery, prostitution, or even slumlords, all which flourish under American capitalism.   Although some might find his credentials enough to accept his flimsy argument, I for one was greatly disappointed. I realize that property is linked to power, but freedom is something completely different.   I'm sure many right-wing folks will look past all of this flaws in this books and embrace it. I'm sure the paternalistic allure of an established Harvard professor will cause some to avoid challenging the views in his book.    But I'm not trying to convince those people. Look past the credentials, the excessive use of footnotes to appear more "academic" ( a clear sign of a writer who is insecure of his own beliefs!), and the comfort of someone who agrees with your agenda, and you will discover shallow puerile nonsense 
 Don't be misled by the cunning title. This book is of use only to the most vapid and self-absorbed therapists or social workers.  I resented almost each of the 184 pages that I read in excruciating agony. Don't get me wrong, I was enthusiastic at first, then I started reading it. Her writing is less than inspiring. "Why?", a reader might ask, is an assessment important? Ms. Lukas is quick to respond that without an assessment, we wouldn't know what the problem is. It's insight like this that earns her a far, far down in the Amazon bestseller list.  I was watching this episode of "American Idol" last night, and saw this kid singing. I thought to myself, Wow!, this kid is good! I hope he wasn't abused! This is exactly the kind of caring that Ms. Lukas calls for in making assessments. I seem to have all the right attributes. Time for the next chapter, although it's going to be hard to top this one!  In her best moments, Ms. Lukas almost overcomes her powerful sense of self-importance to convey something useful, but never quite makes it happen. It's a shame that this book ends up as just another pointless slaughter of perfectly good trees. This wasted paper and wasted my time. Ms. Lukas again attempts to use her innovative "Powerpoint Bullet-point" style of writing to convey a sense of urgency, but comes up dry, like the Sahara on a hot California Friday afternoon in Summer, when there hasn't been any rain in a long, long time. I am reminded of the review on the back cover of the book, where Mr. Strean lauds the book as "highly readable." I would have to, like, totally agree with him. My initial analysis suggests that this book is composed of largely english vocabulary loosely organized into a framework of sentences and paragraphs. I didn't have the time to get much further than this, however, because it all seemed so schizophrenic. She hops from one half-finished thought to the next with the frequency of a cheap portable radio.  Why is there no zero star rating 
 Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.  The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas.  I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs.  Anyone got ideas? 
 I thought this was a fun read some years back..well-written..hence my first inclination to give it 2 stars, but taking another look..if a man ever wrote about his "repulsion" over sex with an overweight woman, the way Robin describes sex with Michael, we'd be taking to the streets in protest...there was such an unkindness to it..and this was a woman with a dear, overweight friend...I'm changing my mind..back to one star..too much shallow emphasis on looks, money, etc..it's not a race thing..it makes all women look bad. Well, maybe just these women..I'd like to think some of us are different 
 If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book 
 the remaining of the REAL Mercury 7(Grissom who died in the fire before this book came out) called this book "fiction" and that Wolfe took too much license with this story. Especially how Grissom is protrayed in whole "hatch" issue. 
 Turgid, juvenile, witless, inconsistent, pointless, flaccid. Reads like the kind of "You Are There" episode a teenage boy would write, featuring of course sex with the historical figure of ones choice. I got the impression that Aldiss fell asleep at the typewriter several times during the writing of the manuscript, and resumed upon waking with whatever popped into his head, without respect for what had just been written. Bad as the movie was, I conclude that it was an improvement over the book 
  Very poorly organized.  Focuses on case studies (like pages and pages about vole hormones and a whole chapter on bird song) rather than concepts.  The writing style is decent, but it's not very comprehensive or clear, and the author makes some mistakes (he misinterprets a critical graph when discussing hyena hormones and ends up with a bad conclusion.  My teacher knows he  screwed it up because she wrote the paper he cites incorrectly).  The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is that my teacher says that, while it is quite bad, there are no better alternatives 
 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.    Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.    Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film.   In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)  The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better 
 I'm giving this one star because "zero stars" isn't an option. There's not a whole lot of Dylan in this, and the "home movies" are just what you'd expect from the days of 8mm film: grainy, blurry, black and white films from the tour...not "of the tour", just from the tour. Tourist kind of stuff, with a lot of the back of Dylan's head, and every once in awhile he'll turn around - which is why my friend has retitled this DVD "Glimpses of Bob".  And listening to Mickey Jones reminisce about his glory days of 40 years ago is kind of tedious; Mickey's looking like he's seen better days.  Save your money up and get "No Direction Home", much more entertaining and informative 
 Nice concept but the code refers to packages, interfaces and classes that don't exist.  Not deprecated, just not there to begin with.  And they're different enough that it really has no relevance to the actual technology.  Very disappointed 
 I got this CD player because I thought sony was a good company, plus I liked the look of it. But after just 5 months after purchase, and not even using it that often, it has already broken. I paid about 40 dollars for this CD player, so I am very disappointed. If I were you, I would buy a different CD player 
 Anyone who's watched TV or looked at newspapers or magazine ads an average amount during their lifetime could put together this list of cliches and hackneyed, mendacious phrases. Could be useful as a guide to what to avoid, but I would die before using it in the way intended 
 If you are new to linear algebra, (even if you took introductory course), don't buy this.  All those who took Linear Algebra course using this book got to hate the subject.  Cheap for the content?  Yes, of course.  Because the content is not good.  Not constructed well.  I'm relearning it using Schaum's Outline, which is good and now I understand what was written in this awful book 
 Though I don't agree with some other reviewers who believe that narrators or main characters need to have redeeming qualities to be interesting or engaging (read the short story "Rock Springs" by Richard Ford), I found Chippering to be just plain annoying. His voice was too silly to keep reading for 384 pages. Maybe it's funny the first time he tells us something that obviously isn't true, but after 300 references to how attractive he is to women when the women he's with clearly despise him, the story gets to be a bit trite. Had this book been a little shorter, maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. I don't know, though, because I never got to the end - and I'm usually the kind that can't leave a book unfinished.  The most interesting part of the story is one which is left almost completely untouched. I kept wanting to read more about Chippering's betrayal of his Green Beret buddies and what they were going to do to him, but after 280 pages of the same nonsense with Lorna Sue and Mrs. Robert Kooshof, I gave up. Okay, maybe Tim O'Brien has been type-cast as a Vietnam writer - but really his best work revolves around the war. Hopefully (ha ha) he can break out of this label, but if he keeps writing GOOD fiction about the war instead of this garbage, I'll be happy 
 Avoid this book like the plague.  This book was the freshman book for my undergraduate education.  It had potential, but meeting the author ruined it.  She came and spoke and we were required to go.  So several hundred college freshmen got to sit there, in early 2002, and listen to a woman describe having cocktails with her friends and watching the World Trade Centers fall.  She said they talked about "How New York was always changing."  In a lunch she had with a few contest "winners" she talked about how she was being paid to write a book on med school, but wasn't being paid as much as a man who actually went to all the classes.  Overall her story had the potential to be inspiring, she lived through a horrible illness and beat horrible odds.  Her story could have been inspiring and brought hope to others who are in the process of battling cancer.  But she never grew beyond being a child.  I guess I could write it all off as just being human, but it went beyond that.  She seemed to see no one outside of herself.  Overall, she was a sad woman who never got beyond her personal pain.  By the time she left our school I think most of us really pittied her.  She had huge potential to be a survivor, but she dropped the ball 
 Anyone who saw this film and gave this more that a 1 star rating must have been on some powerful halucingens to think this movies was anything other than a complete waste of time. Sure it looks good by the cover and the summary, but when I had a group of friends over to all watch this for the first time, we instantly realized why none of us had heard of this movie before. Even porn has higher callibur acting, cinematography, and dialog than this movie! The only saving grace to watching this film was the alcohol on hand to stomach it and having 8 catty friends openly rip it apart Like Tom Servo on Mystery Science Theater! DO NOT BUY THIS FILM! (luckily I got it as a gift).  
 Nice looking. Good quality. But the case has two large flaps on the sides which make it difficult to put the camera in and out. 
 I was disapointed in this product.  It is harder to use and does not clean as well as it seems to in the commercial.  The handle on mine did not lock in position well and kept sliding up into the mop.  I, therefore, did not have the reach that I should have had with it.  The pads don't scrub as well as I would like 
 The play goes along very similar lines as that of the shakespear play  measure for measure as both show selfabsorbtion is a paramount factor  though it does seem like a rewrite is does has its own high points  especially Mosca a very funny character 
 My sister took 2 pills a day for only 2 days, she has stopped taking it for another 2 days and is now hospitalzed. She still has chest pain, shaking, and difficulty breathing and swallowing. She was perfectly healthy before taking xantrex 
 Too many numbers without enough explanation. Shandler seems to assume that you have been reading his books for years and have a thorough understanding of all of his metrics.  However, I do believe that the approach is sound. Including more commentary on players would be useful.  The primary advantage to this book is that it has one of the earliest release dates for books that discusses the coming season. Without much competition, what else are you going to read in the cold of winter?  I doubt if I will buy it again next year 
 O.K. I bought this album about four years ago. To be honest, I don't like this one that much, to be honest, I don't like any MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK at all. I've got two soundtracks: this one and "BATMAN & ROBIN". After I bought both of them, I decided to stay away from these motion picture soundtracks. The only good songs on this album are the first three and a couple more, don't worry 'cause I'll state them, the rest of them are pure garbage:  1.- "Limp Bizkit: Take A Look Around (Theme from "M:I-2)".- I think for everyone, this one is the best on this album. I'm not that much of a LIMP BIZKIT fan, but I like a couple of songs from them. But if you want to listen to this one, then I suggest you buy the album "CHOCLATE STARFISH AND THE HOT DOG FLAVORED WATER", that album is way better than this one and it includes on of their best dongs ever including this one.- 4/5.  2.- "Metallica: I Dissapear".- The other great song on this album, not that great, but one of the best.- 4/5.  3.- "Rob Zombie: Scum Of The Earth".- For me, the hardest rock song on this album. Better than "I Dissapear". I like this band more than LIMP BIZKIT. But if you want to listen to this one buy their album "The Sinister Urge". It is way better than this album.- 5/5.  4.- "Butthole Surfers: They Came In".- This song SUCKS.- 0/5.  5.- "The Pimps: Rocket Science".- O.K. Not as bad as others, but I don't like this one that much.- 3/5.  6.- "Foo Fighters and Brian May: Have A Cigar".- I don't like this one at all. Baaad.- 1/5.  7.- "Chris Cornell: Mission 2000".- This one sucks big time. One of the worst.- 0/5.  8.- "Godsmack: Going Down".- Not as bad as others either, but still I don't like it.- 2/5.  9.- "Uncle Kracker produced by Kid Rock: What U Lookin' At".- Probably this one is better than "I Dissapear"...but...I don't know.- 5/5.  10.- "Apartment 26: Backwards".- Another one that SUCKS. Damn. This album kinda sucks too.- 0/5.  11.- "Diffuser: Karma".- Good. Doesn't suck that much as others.- 3/5.  12.- "Buckcherry: Alone".- Don't like it at all.- 1/10.  13.- "Tinfed: Immune".- Another one I don't like.- 2/5.  14.- "Powderfinger: My Kinda Scene".- The best in this album. I love this one. Finally.- 5/5.  15.- "Tori Amus: Carnival".- SUCKS, SUCKS, SUCKS.- 0/5.  16.- "Hans Zimmer featuring Heitor Pereira: Nyah".- Bit of a Mexican song. I like it.- 4/5.   See. This soundtrack SUCKS. Now...speaking about the movie...I went to the movies to watch this one, it was full of action and smart scenes. I give the movie: 7/10. But the first one was...WOW...I loved it even though I had eight or nine years when I watched it, I understood it perfectly. The scenes are truly very smart, it has a great content and story, great dialogue and enough action, for me. I know it is abvious tha the second movie has alot more action and chases, but I liked the first better. I give Misson: Impossible a 10/10. I loved that one.  Remember...don't buy this crap, you would be doin' a very very big mistake like I did, if you only want this album because of the theme song from LIMP BIZKIT, buy the album CHOCOLATE STARFISH AND THE HOT DOG FLAVORED WATER instead, that album is way better than this one. If you only want this album because of ROB ZOMBIES's "Scum Of The Earth", which I love by the way, then buy the album: "The Sinister Urge". But whatever you do:                     DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!! 
 Like everybody else, I bought this not because I wanted it, but because it was the class text and thus, required.  In that sense, it did its job (and the instructor's) in that it conveyed the information needed to pass the exams.  The downside: --Numerous typo's, especially in the practice problems, leaving you to wonder why your answer doesn't jibe with the book's.  Frustrating.  --SEVERAL leaps in logic:  The book will (loosely) explain a concept.  Then it will give an equation with no explanation as to how it was derived from the original concept.  Sure, you can just memorize the equation, but without understanding WHY it works, it's awful hard to apply it to the real world.  VERY frustrating.  --Many concepts are glossed over.  Not too useful to those making a career of this.  I suppose this book is somewhat useful for a refresher course in geometry and basic surveying math, but it's no value.  Get it only if you have to.  And get it used 
 I have the Safari TT Dbl jogger from In Step and  I bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non-existent.    I have seen this product work well on single strollers, but it keeps blowing up and back from my canopy with the slighest of breezes, so it is not doing such a great job of keeping the sun off my kid's faces.  I've used a binder clip to keep it in place, but it still blows back more than I think it should.. 
 We had this less than 10 months and used only two of three Ultimate filters we purchased separately, that's how little use this pitcher got. Started leaking everywhere one day and I couldn't figure out what had happened. I thought I hadn't put the innards back in right, after changing the filter, but in the end I decided either a seal or a seam failed.   I'm not the first person to report the leaking problem with minimal use, so I believe it is a design or manufacturing flaw. What a waste of a good $60, with the additional three filters purchased.  While it worked, we loved its sleek design, how much water it held and how great the water tasted. That's why it gets the two stars I gave it. Too bad it turned out to be a piece of junk.  I see the item is now not available here at Amazon and I guess that means someone monitored the returns or complaints about the product and made changes or pulled the item from sales rotation.   What I want to know is when we will be notified by Pur about the problem, and given coupons or rebates because of it; if you sent in your warranty card or registered the product online there is no reason Pur couldn't offer somehting in exchange for their poorly designed item.   Mine's now in the trash where it belongs. Don't buy one if you are considering it. Go with a good quality, faucet-mounted or under-sink mount filtering system and you will be glad you did, despite the more expensive price 
 I have to admit it.  This book left me scratching my head wondering exactly what the other reviewers saw in it.      The Story:  The koalas at the zoo have become disenchanted with one another.  No one remembers why, but the end result is that they are not speaking to one another.  The wisest koala decides that if they have a great costume ball that all will again become copacetic.   Well, the rest of the less-wise koalas love the idea.  They soon gather in their many costumes and dance their many dances.  At sundown, they happily obey the suggestion of the wise old Koala to take their costumes off.   (The wise old koala believes that once the costumes are off that they will behave more civilly.)   So what happens?    It turns out all the anger isn't gone.   Despite having such a fine party, the bears can't let go of their crankiness because they can't tell who is who.  We are told by the author that "Koala bears are famous for looking very much alike...." and so  they go back to being angry.  The Hunting Bear didn't know the Nurse Bear.  The Indian Bear didn't know the Chinese Bear.  They started to get angry all over again and some low growling  was heard.  The wise old bear is not flummoxed by this turn of events.  Mustering up his wisdom, he suggests they all put their costumes back on and go on with the dance.  This they do and the Koala's dance the night away.  And   The next day, it turns out that the bears had such a good time that they decide to wear parts of their costumes... and so [drum roll] they learn to differentiate themselves once again.  And... the book concludes with: "He scratched his head and thought:  "From now on, in Koala Park, there must be many, many more BEAR PARTIES!"  Huh?  Perhaps the point is that we need differences to get along.  Or perhaps there is no point.  [Or perhaps I could be more creative about finding one if I had more sleep and more coffee.]    I can only explain the Caldecott Honor by way of the 1951 publication date.  The 50's are not particularly well know for great children's writing.  But then again... the other 2 reviewers seem to love this book.  In any case, hope this helps.  TwoStars.  Intriguing artwork.  Story leaves this mom feeling like years of college were wasted.  And if the point is this hard for an adult to grasp, what chance have young children got 
 The cover claims that the book has been "revised and updated for the digital age," but Winston's information on technological tools is both superficial and already dated. The term, "PDA," does not even appear in the index 
 I bought this book on the recommendation of several people that I know pretty well, unfortunately, this book is filled with errors upon errors and is filled with a typical neo-confederate bias by the author.  In fact, the book should be called "How confederates saved America" as he gives the credit for the peaceful return of the confederate armies to confederate generals such as Lee, Johnson and Forrest, rather than on Lincoln's instructions to Grant and Sherman and generous terms known as the River Queen Doctrine, "I want no one punished; treat them liberally  all around.  We want those people to return to their allegieance to the United States and submit to the laws".  His errors are numerous.  He talks of the possibility of the confederates disbanding their armies and moving into the hills and waging a guerilla warfare against the US troops and sights examples of how successful this tactic has been throughout time and he includes in these examples the American Revolution.  He states that Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter and Andrew Pickens(who all could be called partisans or guerilla fighters), but then he goes on to state that Nathaniel Greene was a guerilla fighter as well.  Now only someone completely ignorant of US Army history could ever make such a statement.  Nathaniel Greene served in the Continental Army and was the Quartermaster General, he was in no way a guerilla, nor did he use guerilla tactics.  He continues on that Greene used guerilla tactics in battle at Kings Mountain and Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse.  Besides the basic fact that Greene wasn't even at the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, neither one could be said to be guerilla attacks.  At Kings Mountain, the American militia found Patrick Ferguson and his men well entrenched in defenses at the crest of the mountain and formed up and attacked the positions, hardly a guerilla tactic. Cowpens was fought by Daniel Morgan and was a set piece battle where he destroyed Tarleton's legion.  Greene attacked Cornwallis at Guilford Courthouse in another set piece battle and was winning until Cornwallis took the extreme measure of firing canister directly into the center of the two massed armies, killing and wounding as many of his own men as he did Americans.  None of these battles were guerilla fighting and Greene in no way can be called a guerilla.  The author shows his neo-confederate bias most clearly by restating the apocryphal stories of rape, theft and outright murder by Sherman's troops during the Savannah and Carolina Campaigns as matter of historical facts.  He continually paints the Federals in the worst of lights, while reserving his highest praise and most eloquent prose for the confederates.  He incorrectly quotes Sherman when he claims Sherman said "Sherman himself explained that in his march, he inflicted an astonishing $100 million worth of damage, of which only $20 million was necessary, the rest being "simply waste and destruction"".  He clearly is slanting his own words to convince people that Sherman was in fact "the devil" as the neo-cons believe he is.  Unfortunately, what he CLAIMS Sherman said has no relation to what he actually said.  From the Official Records, Vol 44, page 13; in Sherman's report on his campaign to the War Dept, he states "I estimate the damage done to the State of Georgia and its military resources at $100,000,000; at least, $20,000,000 of which has inured to our advantage, and the remainder is simple waste and destruction."  Sherman does not, as Mr. Winik claims state that only $20 million was necessary, what Sherman said was that his army confiscated and USED(inured means to use) $20 million worth of the property and destroyed the remaining $80 million of confederate civilian and private property that was going to be used against the armed forces of the United States.  If you are a confederate "lost causer" then you will enjoy this novel, however, if you are looking for historical truth, then you should read a different book.  William Hal 
 A very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level. The movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue: I've heard better lines in 'Fast Times At Richmond High' thank you.    Altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing. Don't believe the great reviews about this film: the film might appeal to the 14-17 year-old crowds fantasizing about how 'cool' college life might be with all the 'cool' people and 'parties.' If you're not in that category, skip this boring film and save both your time and your money.    
 This book has all old material and is outdated. I would recommend anything from Len Wilson and Jason Moore or Anthony Coppedge over this book 
 Only one-third of the book covers what a typical Rich Dad Poor Dad reader would expect: how to use corporations to protect one's assets.  The information in this section is really helpful and interesting, especially for beginners.  The author provided great examples to illustrate key points.  The writing overall, however, could be improved by having better summaries of each chapter and by defining every new legal term used in the book (for example, the book never defined "indemnification" but it used it frequently).    Another one-third of the book covers how to start a company and take it public (have it listed as a public stock).  I don't think any typical Rick Dad Poor Dad reader has this purpose in mind for their businesses or real estate purchases, so this second part of the book is utterly useless and irrelevant to most readers.  The last one-third of the book basically lists the laws for incorporation for each state, which is useful, but I'm sure the author could have provided a webpage to list all this information.    Another thing to consider is that this book might be outdated.  It was published in 2001, and laws may have changed by now (this review is written in early 2006).  For example, the double-taxation policy of dividends was changed after the publication of this book.  I think the author might have overcome this by providing updates to important relevant laws through a website or something similar.    For all these reasons, I'd recommend the interested reader to explore other sources first.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend other books yet.  If there doesn't seem to be any other good sources, then consider reading this book only if you can buy it used or borrow it from the library. 
 If you read the Elvis and Marilyn affair, you know that Robert S. Levinson is capable of taking his readers through fascinating elements of celebrity lives.  Naturally, if you liked John Lennon, you are looking forward to that happening again.  Well, don't buy the book for that reason . . . unless you are a ghoul and want to more about John Lennon's murder.    The story opens like an afterword for the author's previous book, The James Dean Affair (which I have not yet read).  Former spouses Neil Gulliver (and L.A. newspaper columnist) and Stephanie (Stevie) Marriner are taking a break from being huddled in Stevie's mansion being guarded by a lethal type when a T-man, Martin Halliwell, intrudes on their luncheon.  Halliwell says that a mobster named Aaron Lodger has taken over the 2001 running of the Imagine That! Festival in the desert to launder his dirty money.  Halliwell wants to use their past connections with the festival and former-star-turned-politician, Richie Savage, to penetrate the plot.  The book meanders on from there with extended flashbacks into Lennon's murder, how Neil became a reporter, Neil's almost marriage before meeting Stevie, Stevie and Neil's marriage, and Neil's friendship with Harry Nilsson.  It was all way more than I wanted to know.    The plot finally kicked into a higher and more interesting gear on page 214.  I would have stopped long before then, but I had read the next book in the series, Hot Paint, and wanted to know more about the Lodger and Savage characters in order to complete my understanding of that book.  It turns out that there are a lot of people flying under false colors in this book, and the substance of the plot is a far-fetched conspiracy story about every suspicious political death in recent years.  After a quick jolt on page 214, the story once again slows down and starts meandering almost as much.    I recommend that you skip this book and read Hot Paint instead.  Mr. Levinson seems to have wanted to create a book about what it was like to hang out with Harry Nilsson.  He would have done better to have written that book than this one.        
 I'm disgusted by DePalma.  This is trash and so is he.  It is too manipulative and it is completely his fault.  He stretches out these horror scenes in the most manipulative way, as we watch Travolta fight his way through crowds to save the girl.  This kind of manure (self censorship) angers me.  This isn't art.  It's garbage.  His whole purpose is to manipulate us, to extend the horror scene in the most manipulative way.  Don't you see how phony it is?  Don't you resent how he is playing with your emotions?  You call this art?  You call this talent?  You call this good directing?  It's trash.  He stinks.  If he's trying to copy Hitchcock, he's not doing it right.  Why not show us Travolta swimming through sharks trying to save the girl.  I got it.  How about Travolta pushing kindergarten kids out of the way trying to save the girl from a four year old strangler.  And stretch the scene out, make it last through the whole milk and cookies period, as Travolta keeps pushing kids out of his way and the kids are merrily eating their Oreos and the girl is getting strangled.  Eeek.  That's a good scream.  DePalma, you stink.  What other stupid tricks can you do 
     I have read this book from cover to cover, and while it does give a brief explanation of quite a few things vampire related, it is far from complete.  This is a bore to read through although it is a somewhat handy vampire reference guide. If you are looking for minimal detail This would be the guide for you.    If you are looking for something more in depth, I would suggest the Vampire Book.  It has many more entries and although it is quite thick, is very enjoyable to read.  Not to mention it has more knowledge about vampires than you could ever ask for [in one place] 
 I admire Gibson's work, but this book reflects too much intoxication and not enough theory or study of human life. The characters are transparent and the drama window dressing on a plot that never quite materializes. He hammers home a few concepts here and there, but really, nothing unifies this book except the cover. Skip it and go for one of Gibson's lucid and beautiful works like "Neuromancer" or "Pattern Recognition. 
     One of my friends gave me this book as a late Christmas' present. I like reading about courtesans ever since I enjoyed reading "Nana" by Emile Zola. The subject is a meaty one, filled with lots of whimsy and cheekiness. This writer, however, managed to deflate every ounce of excitement I had for this book. Her writing style is best described as a mix of stream-of-consciousness and ultra-flowery wording. I managed to hang on for three chapters before I ended up donating this book to a local library. A total snooze on a very interesting subject. I would give it no stars if it was possible 
 Have you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you wouldn't feel bad?  Have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him? In this story, the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he's still a "good guy" because "good guys" don't do bad things.  Dizzing logic, huh?  Throughout the novel, you review his senior year of high school with him.  It starts out with the story of how he got the nickname "Killer" to why it's okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue.  The flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he didn't rape her.  He won't let her leave the room until she believes it.  The ending is less than satisfactory for me.  I would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice 
 There is not much to read in this book.  The depth of research is almost nonexistent 
 Wish I had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before I purchased this. I went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a Braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years.  After it got the new plastic taste out of it, it made good coffee. Even without the Brita Filter.  Just like all the reviewers indicated, the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully.  Unfortunately, it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months.  The seller, Etronics, is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period.  That will be the last thing I buy through them.  Like uhh, since they sell Braun,one would think they would have some recourse through Braun and try to help their customers.  So, here I am between the proverbial rock and a hard place,  try to find a Braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced, or just bite the bullet an go buy another. (want to bet it won't be a Braun?) Additionally, what do we do for coffee in the mean time?  Such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet 
 I found this book to be a vaguely interesting dissertation on what the SHAM (Self-Help Actualization Motivational) Movement is, and maybe even on why it is, but no help whatsoever in giving me any tools for argument against it.  I thought, sucked in by the interesting cover suggesting brain-washing in such a humorous way, that the author might have a sense of humor herself and I'd find her book absorbing intellectually and on other levels as well.  I would read a page or a paragraph or two, close the book, and nod off.  This is such a fascinating area, it could be the basis for a really fascinating book, but "Self-Help, Inc..." left me feeling I needed to go to a self-help group to deal with the density of the verbage.  It would not appeal most to the people most in need of reading it  -  the victims of SHAM 
 Mickey's father was a championship pool player before he died, back when Mickey was a baby.  Now that Mickey is eleven, he is determined to follow in his father's footsteps, starting by beating the local bully in the town's big children's pool tournament.  When an old friend of his father's walks back into their lives and offers to coach him, Mickey is thrilled.  His mother, though, isn't quite so enthusiastic.  The story is decent, although a bit cliche.  It is obvious what will happen with all of the conflicts; there isn't a whole lot of tension.  I didn't really like any of the characters in this story.  I thought Mickey was really whiny, and he and his friend acted much younger than fifth grade.  It seemed they were always screaming something, and I found that irritating. 
 If you are looking for some insight into the history of terrorist networks and what motivites these peaople then keep looking.  If you are looking for a short book of facts about al-Qaida then this is the book for you.  I found this book extremely dissappointing.  For one it is a mere 52 pages. (excluding the bibliography and long appenices).  The rest  of the book is little more than a list of facts.  ie 27 pages listing known or suspected members with a brief paragraph about each and 15 pages of a timeline listing several dates with a sentance or 2 about each 
 After looking through the book, I found this book not so structured. The diagrams are not enough to get the reader easily understood. The description of how the algorithms work in the book is unclear. The book  just listed out some basis without further looking. And the 'see also'  reference in the book makes the readers jump from page to page without  giving the titles of the pages. The material covered by this book is ok,  but it has the potential to improve 
 I tried this knife at Sur La Table at the Furi demo. They appeared to be very sharp. However I did not like these knives for the following reasons  1) I dont care much for the cheap plastic-like orange handles   2) The finish on the knives appear to be cheap. Furi implies that these knives are made in Germany. However they are cheaply "Made in China". Now generally I dont care that much .. everything is now made in China anyways.. But when I am paying so much money for a product, I was hoping it was made in Germany or USA.  3) The case is even more cheaply made.  Personally, I would wait for a sale on the Global or the Wustof knives 
 While the pan handle stays cool, the lid handle heats up with the pan.  You need a pot holder to use the cover.  I didn't like that. 
 This book should be withdrawn by the publisher with an apology for false advertisng.   Let us be clear first about what it is NOT.  It is not in anyway a verbatim reprint of the First Book of Common Prayer.  In fact, it is not even the 1549 prayer book arranged for modern use as the editor/author states.  Rather, it is one individual's personal revision of the Book of Common Prayer.    This book contains material that was not even in the prayer book of 1549.  In fact, it is a combination of material from various editions of the Book of Common Prayer, including revisions made long after Thomas Cranmer was burned at the stake. The editor also takes Cranmerian material and arranges it in significantly different order than that used by the Archbishop.  This edition also makes claims in its preface that are not correct. The most egregiously false is the claim that Cranmer intended lay persons to serve as officiants for many of the services.  That simply is not true.  Cranmer was far more medieval in outlook than many modern students realize. He envisioned all the services being done by ordained clergy, assisted by lay clerks.  The editor of this book claims that where Cranmer used the word "minister" he intended lay persons or clergy.  This is not true.  Cranmer used minister in a protestant sense to mean an ordained person in a reformed church.  The notion of lay ministry was fairly weak at the time and Cranmer would not have used the title minister for a lay person.  When Cranmer means a lay minister he uses the term Clerk or Clark. As far as lay folks administering communion from reserved sacrament, Cranmer actually intended to abolish the reservation of the sacrament.  Lay folk administering the holy communion was not even in Cranmer's mind.  Having said a great deal about what I think is wrong with this book, a few positive statements are also required.  While this is one person's revision in an era when most prayer books are revised by committees, it is skillfully done. The compiler clearly loves traditional language liturgy in the Anglican style and it shows.  He grasps the nuances and subtlties of Tudor religious language well.  Many of his arrangements are quite felicitous and could be used by a worship leader, ordained or lay, with ease.  In fact, I would commend this book to be studied by anyone on a committee preparing a revision of the Book of Common Prayer as an example of how such work can be done well.  At the same time, I would emphasize again that in no way can this book claim to be an accurate edition of the First English Prayer Book.  What a shame that such a fine volume was launched with such a deceptive title. It is because the title is deceptive that I give it only two stars.  If it had billed itself honestly as a modern revision of the Book of Common Prayer in traditional language, I would have given it a four or five.  Donald Lowery York, South Carolin 
 There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment! 
 so this is a message to the two amazon sellers that are trying to flog it for $2,475.00 or $190. Are they insane. No ones going to buy a book at that price you morons. Lower it to $20 and I'll buy it right now, god dammit. Or do you want me to suffer a really painfull suicide because I havent got the tecnique under wraps. Hey i might even fail and end up brain damaged or paralized. Then what the hell am I gonna do? They dont sell guns on my little Island.   
 I thought this book was the worst book ever.  It was so boring!  Did I mention that it was the WORST BOOK EVER!!!!  It was the worst book in the history of bad books.  You should never read it.  Take my word on that.  Oh, and I didn't just choose to read it on my own.  A teacher forced me to read the dumb novel.  IT'S THE WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!! 
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
 I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book 
  		If euphoria is the result of unwarranted optimism based on substantial previous achievement, then Galbraith was sadly carried away by the euphoria of his own reputation in attempting this topic.  	Many of his books are beacons of astute political, economic and social judgment;  one of his finest, rarely if ever matched by any author, is 'The Scotch'.  This book is more of a Cliff's Notes compilation of financial accidents, concluding with the wise advice to "Be Careful".  	To take one example, he doesn't explain the WHY of Tulipomaniaof the 1630s.  He merely concludes, "Anyone who has seen the tulip fields of this calm and pleasat land in the spring retains forever a feeling that the Tulipomania did foretell nature's true grace."  Time and again he walks away from poignant examples with the obvious conclusion that sometimes something nice happens.  	Financial euphoria, from what I've seen, is very much like the mania for hula hoops, basketball hoops and Beanie Babies and a Google stock IPO.  The madness of crowds for new fads is a result of honest and optimistic people who want to share in a good thing.  This is the basis of a prosperous society, even if it can lead to occasional financial euphoria.  	Sadly, he mixes the madness of Tulipomania with the outright fraud of crooks who deliberately create a climate of excited optimism to defraud honest people.  Fraud is a circus salesmen who offers "a special opportunity" to "See the Egress" for only a small fee.  There's a big difference between honest promoters and cynical crooks.  It makes me suspect Galbraith was never a salesman, and resolutely ignored the circus if it ever ventured near Harvard.  	Galbraith ignores the vast difference between the two.  One is the enthusiastic optimism of a promoter with a new idea who takes great risks to make it a reality;  an example is Thomas Edison and his thousands of attempts to develop ideas into useful products.  The second is the enthusiastic illusions of a trickster whose only goal is to separate the honest but optimistic people from their money;  an example is Robert Vesco.  	In the first case, an optimistic society with confidence in a better future can become the victim of the irrational exuberance of its expectations.  This phenomena truly needs to be studied to understand irrational financial euphoria.  The second is the crook who uses clever words instead of a big club to steal from anyone and everyone.  	Galbraith failed to distinguish between the two or to explain the nature of either.  It makes his book more of a short example of overconfidence in his own ability to be cogent, concise and relevant.    
 I read Bergdorf Blondes earlier this summer and highly recommend it if you'd like to suspend reality for a few hours and get a girly, humorous dose of the high-maintenance lifestyle of a Manhattan socialite.  I certainly can't say the same for Debutante Divorcee - the story is far less engaging; the observations of manners, dress, and other details of society life are shallow and don't add much to the storytelling.  Worse, the characters evolve from boring to saccharine - and their respective stories are tied up at the end in a very unimaginative, deux ex machina sort of way that will leave you rolling your eyes.  Methinks PS could do better.  
 As anyone with a good understanding of Nietzsche's thought can see, the only possible title for a book which is more absurd and oxymoronic than "A Nietzschean Defense of Democracy" would be "A Christian Defense of Satanism." "Neo-Nietzscheans," like Professor Hatab, never fail to remind us of Nietzsche's contempt for the nationalists and racists who would later appropriate his ideas, yet they ignore the obvious fact that Nietzsche would feel no less disgust at his misuse by today's version of the scholarly oxen he loathed a century ago. Unless you want a calculated manipulation of Nietzsce's thought in order to justify the leftism of the average academic philosopher, do not read this book or any other book written by a "Neo-Nietzchean". Like all great philosophers, Nietzsche's thought is far too complex to be appropriated by an existing political ideology without blatantly contradicting much of what he wrote and stood for. If you want to know what Nietzsche really said, read Nietzsche and no one else 
 I have waited years for this album to be released on CD, but listening to it this week has been a big disappointment.  Rather than digitalizing this from the master tapes, this CD was quite obviously made straight from vinyl - complete with hisses, pops, etc.  Especially poor toward the end (ruining one of the finest recordings of Icarus with McCandless at his best).  I really expected more and suspect the members of Oregon had very little to do with this release.  C'mon folks, yank this off the shelf and give us the real recording.  I still have my vinyl version of this and it is easier to listen to. 
 Al Franken is intelligent, witty and informed and for those of us who were already sick to death of Rush Limbaugh's dreck when this book was released, it was a guilty pleasure. Yes, we knew the taunting was childish but on the other hand, we also knew Rush needed to be taken down a peg or two. Reason and facts weren't having the least effect, so why not hit him where it hurt?  However, with the benefit of hindsight, maybe it's not so funny to publicly humiliate people for their physical appearence. Especially when it results in the target trying so desperately to drop pounds, he becomes addicted to drugs (hey, fellow liberals, if we have enough compassion to support needle-exchange programs for street junkies, why do some of us have bumper stickers mocking R. L. for HIS drug problems?)  Neither is it very funny to contemplate the further degeneration of public discourse in this country. How can we complain about Ann Coulter and insist the Right renounce her unless we renouce the childish name-callers in our own ranks?  And so, although I agree with Franken's other, truly serious political critiques of the pundits, on my bookshelf, this particular title has worn out its welcome 
 "The Goal" was a great book but Goldratt is trying to continue to cash in on that success with this book.  It is remarkably poorly written and an absolute waste of time.  Not one new useful piece of knowledge in this book 
 Having been a Joe Cocker fan in the late 60s and the 70s, I recently realized that I had no Joe on CD (only on vinyl). After picking up his greatest album ever ("Joe Cocker!") on CD, I ordered "The Best of Joe Cocker" to bring me up to speed. One of the main reasons for getting this CD was that it contained the LIVE VERSION of "Help from My Friends." However, after receiving the CD and listening to the first few notes of "My Friends," I realized that this was NOT the live version we all know and love. The classic live version of this song done at Woodstock (as well as the studio version on his 1st LP) makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck (the way the lead to "Stairway to Heaven" always does). This version is OK, but BUYER BEWARE - it is WAY less powerful than the Woodstock version. The rest of the album is OK, but all these songs are so overproduced compared those songs exhibiting the raw energy that his earlier work had. This was a disappointing buy 
  well the band sounds like a yellow card,simple plan,panic at the disco,all american rejects etc. ALL of the bands have the same sound and music that a person from 10-17 would buy. And you proboly saw the video before hearing the song on the radio. If your older 18 and up. you need to get in to some GOOD music. Try the ramones, the offspring, sex pistols or even green day.    
 I truly expected more from this but from beginning to end it seemed trite, unconvincing and entirely too derivative.  The characters fall flat and the writing is simplistic.  At least it IS short 
 This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work 
 Celine Dion is the bomb. How like the bomb in this.  DVF is the bomb. Celine hee!  Was this review helpful to you?  Well 
 ...this movie is a dud. Who'd have thought that John Wayne and the director of "Support Your Local Sherrif" would have joined forces for this stinker!  The characterization hints at being good, but really its character actors doing what they do best - being good support characters. Its a good thing to because the Duke really just mailed this one  in.  First - what this movie does well:  -Ann Margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy.  -the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show.  -it is interesting that the bad guys chasing Ann Margaret and John Wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end. When you get to the end, you learn why, but it works well to keep them faceless.  -the last 10 minutes is good - top notch with a twister of an ending.  HOWEVER, what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right:  -John Wayne is absolutely uninspired - he is just a cardboard version of himself - a cranky, mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character - and when they do, it seems very, very clunky.  -At least 20 minutes of this movie consists of long-distance shots of people riding horses. Sometimes, they ride over hills, sometimes they ride through valleys. We get 4 separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the Rio Grande (the border with Mexico). Fill in this time with some character development! Some dialogue! Anything!  -the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie.  All in all, it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so John Wayne could have another movie in the theaters. Too bad, a crack team of writers could have made it something special.  My suggestion, get "Cowboys" or either of the two "Rooster Cogburn" movies or "Support Your Local Sherrif" and see this actor and this director doing much better work! 
 What is the longevity of John Bradshaw's book, and how does his writing stand up in the perspective of time?  The book was published over ten years ago, and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards, of which it was a part.  The first thing I noticed about Bradshaw's writing is its sheer verbosity.  He writes in a roundabout way, rather than concisely and to the point.  Contrast him, for example, with a writer on Buddhism or Taoism (say, Alan Watts?).    Writing on Buddhism or Taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise, but the human growth movement is broad and billowy, and concise writing may not be important to the authors.    And Bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement, to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all: Shame.  Bradshaw reports that he is a theologian, but also someone who recovered from alcoholism, and was deeply shamed as a child, which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome.    There are many fine snippets from his book, which may be of use to folks, but overall, I think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations.  To paraphrase another well-known quotation, "People cannot live on concepts alone."  If he had given more personal studies or little case histories, it would have been much more helpful.  Instead, he includes page after page of some "guided" meditations or shame inquiries, which were totally useless to me.  If you are looking for guided meditations, this is the place for you.    So, in all, Bradshaw's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time, in my opinion.  It's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth.  Anyway, it was a bestseller once, and that's what counts, I guess.  It did have its 15 minutes of fame, and a lot of books never even get that.  Diximus.     
 I am very  dissapointed with this album, it has not the mistyc of VNV.  I suppose that this was only a mistake of these musician stars. I will wait the next release.  
 After performing in the pit orchestra of a community theatre production of Chess I bought the London concept cast recording.  I followed that up with this recording.  Fortunately, the show I was part of seemed to pick the best of both versions, even if I have yet to find one with the Soviet Machine, that's next on my list.  That aside, I found the voices and the musicians in the Broadway recording severely lacking.  Molokov and Anatoliy were not dark and brooding enough, Freddie was presented more like the boy next door than a bad boy, and Florence was too rough cut.  The alternative orchestration of Quartet and Bangkok left a lot to be desired as well.  As a musician, I immediately noticed that the orchestra sounded like they were not auditioned for the job.  For a show with such meaty orchestrations, they sounded anemic.  Overall, the presentation of this recording is very weak.  I wish I had saved my money, even though it was nice to remember some of the elements from the version I was part of.  The Swedish Concert recording is next on my list and hopefully I will enjoy that better.  I read a review on a Danish recording I'd love to get my hands on, but can't find it anywhere 
 I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through).  It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere.  I do not recommend this book 
  Having been interested in "house churches" for some time, I purchased the book: "How to Meet in Homes."  My recommendation: If you want a Gene Edwards book that will edify, either buy: "A Tale of Three Kings" or "The Prisoner in the Third Cell."  While both of these books are helpful and edifying, there is very little helpful or edifying about: "How to Meet in Homes."  Basically, Mr. Edwards never answers the question, only reiterating over and over again, the evils of the modern church service.  May I therefore remind everyone reading my review: The very fact that Mr. Edwards would criticize the way a church meets is an example of hypocrisy.  If the church is to choose for itself how to gather and fellowship (as Mr. Edwards so readily declares), you then cannot deem any particular form or fashion as being wrong.  This is very sad 
 Not very well written. Its is simplistic & somewhat condescending. Later chapters tend to repeat basic concepts covered earlier without expanding upon the issues. There are more knowlegable authors out there that are refreshing and can effectively advance the your knowledge 
 Turbo Tax is fine. The linking into Quickbooks Pro (QBP) is limited to only the most recent 2 versions of QBP. So if you have an older version (older than 2005) you have to buy the new QBP to have Turbo Tax lift the data out of QB. Now Intuit will only sell a new version of 2007 - NO MORE UNGRADES. "For the consumer" they will tell you. BS, I will be changing accounting platforms as soon as I can find a replacement. This is the problem with software oligolopies! An Open Source replacement is much needed for both Tax prep and accounting. 
 If you need to witness intellectual Onanism by a group of graphic designers, many of whom seem to have unhealthily high opinions of themselves, this anthology is for you.  Some of the charts, such as those by Hamid Rashi, are completely incomprehensible to the point of self-parody, albeit probably intended to be trendy.  Others, such as those by Ramano Rao, might convey useful information, but are printed on colored backgrounds and hence unreadable 
 2 months after ordering, i have year to get my first issue.  i'm sure i'll like it...if i ever get it 
 I just received the Brenthaven Sleeve for the Black MacBook that I just bought from Amazon.  I wouldn't call it a sleeve because that implies that you can slide your laptop in from the top.  It is more of a zip-open luggage style case. There is also a zippered compartment inside the case, and I am concerned that this zipper might rub against and scratch the MacBook.  It is also so snug inside, it's a struggle to get the laptop seated.  I'm wondering if I was sent the right case. On the plus side, it is very well constructed, but don't think it's right for me 
 I rented this movie because I registered my TIVO with Amazon and got the $15 credit.  I thought it might be a good opportunity to see some movies I wouldn't normally rent.  I watched the trailer on this, thought it looked like it might be amusing, and downloaded it.  Unfortunately, the only funny scene in the movie was in the trailer and I ended up falling asleep the first 30 minutes into it.  After I woke up, I thought maybe I hadn't given it a fair shot and went back to try it again.  I was right to fall asleep the first time through.  I don't usually rate movies - or anything for that matter, but felt compelled to share my opinion with anyone who was seriously considering spending money on this one.  Spend that $3.99 on a burger, or a good book...anything else but this 
 I taught classroom NLP for years, and I'm offended by this so-called self-help book. NLP is found by John Grinder, and in its purest form has been misused and misrepresented. Everybody claims to practice NLP as a  result of Tony Robbins. This book should have focused more on the real NLP  techniques. See Tony's Unlimited Power. It's much better 
 This text and CD set gives a decent practical introduction to Italian, with clear and manageable grammar information. I would estimate that it is equivalent to a college semester of a language, if you learn this text well.  CDs give very clear and lovely examples of Italian conversational speech. One can follow along in the text; this is very helpful.  The format of the text, however, makes it somewhat difficult to review, and there isn't even a vocabulary list at the end of each chapter! This is a serious flaw.  I would prefer also extensive review exercises at the end of the chapter.  Instead, there are only small practice sessions embedded in the the text. I would like this format--it makes it seem manageable--if only there were also review sections at the end 
 I HAVE HAD OTHER LESS EXPENSIVE MODELS OF NOTELCO RAZORS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN COSTS IS WORTH THE HIGH PRICE 
 What, another stupid sequel to a crappy horror mess? I did not know that studios were this desperate for some lousy cash. This franchise needs to be destroyed. Skip this and look at another product 
 Yes it's alternate all right- as in the authors ARE NOT historians and just make it up as they go along.  I read through the previous reviews and only counted 5 (?) negatives which only proves that the detractors did not feel compelled to expend effort on a story they didn't like or the positive writers were smoking some good stuff and didn't really remember too much of what they read.  I read each of the NEGS to be sure I didn't rehash prior arguments.  Straight off I was discouraged by the complete lack of knowledge and/or research in their project.  On page 33 there is a description of the "Nineteenth AD" division insignia; "a white star on a badge of crimson".  HOLY COW Batman, US armored divions, then as now, all use a triangular patch of red, blue and yellow with their numeric designation centered in the bottom half.  Question to the authors... what the (heck) is a Schmeisser?  It is not a German SMG as the authors in child-like enthusiam repeatedly misuse the term.  You might say, "bah these are small things" but they are indemic of a poorly crafted work.  I am struggling mightily to finish this horrid tale as I am stubborn and refuse to let a book "beat me" but I have already binned my mass-back copy of the follow-on Fox on the Front UNREAD.  Fool me once, shame on you-fool me twice shame on me!  
 It is truly sad to see that some people are basing their opinion on Theosophy, its aims, goals and history of it's founder H.P.B on such a flawed, biased and error filled book.  It is obvious that Mr. Washington took all the negative third party opinions, not only of the TS Society itself, but of it's founder H.P.B, and crammed them all into one factually impaired piece of work.  He conveniently fails to present powerful counter evidence to pretty much all of his libelous claims.  Some of which are either horrendously exagerated, or bordering on made-up.  Don't take my word for it though, in fact, don't ever take ANYONE's word for anything, do your own research and then decide.  Read up on what Theosophy is, and what the TS Society was created to do, and then use your own innate intuition to base your opinions.  This is actually one of the main rules in theosophy, use your own intellect, do not just blindly follow another's opinion, specially when said opinion is based on zero personal expirience on the subject matter as it seems to be the case with Mr Washington and the topics of his book.  My advice, pass this book up and try your hand at reading a real Theosophy book before passing judgement on it and on Blavatsky 
 I had to force myself to finish this book. I don't allow myself to move onto a new read until I've finished the one that I've started, and this by far was the most difficult to get through. The dialogue between characters is laughable, the promising plot points are either too rushed or go on for far too long thereby destroying any bit of excitement that could be felt from them. Ted Bell's description and background on these characters makes them too unbelievable either by allowing them every positive characteristic (Alex Hawke) or changing their characteristics when its convenient (bin Wazir). There is nothing endearing about this novel, I honestly cannot believe this book was ever a bestseller. Do yourself a favor, bypass this book and read the 007 series by Ian Fleming. 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 The collection isn't of notes or recaps of Kottler's book.  It's a glossary.  I don't recall learning anything significant readuing a dictionary.  At least a dictionary is alphabetized.  I purchased this product because the Kottler book was on back order.  I would not use this line again without having first phyiscally reveiwed the contents to see if it could provide information that would resonate 
 Although the author has a fantastic vocabulary and writes well, I feel that she veered off the subject of her CURRENT backyard too often. I had no interest in reading about the glacial age and the history of wolves in Maine and an entire chapter was dedicated to it. Nor was I interested in reports about lawns in Arizona and California, where the author had visited, or facts about the insulation in her house, and the way that fuel usage affects the environment.  However, there are interesting observations presented in a very readable manner, along the way.  If you are interested in native versus non-native plant species, you will learn about them here.  And some stories, like the relationship that develops with a chipmunk, are heartwarming.      In summation:  I felt that many of the subjects written about were not first hand experiences, but rather information that the author gleened from professionals in their respective fields.  I expected something along the lines of a  journal, and something with a stronger timetable, that would represent "A Year on the Lawn".     
 I agree with Masala1226: many of the chapters were quite boring.  I think the author could have done a lot more with the story, especially some of the dialogue, which sometimes didn't seem to fit what was going on.  I know she translated some of the original Italian, and because it took place hundreds of years ago that makes a difference, but still.  I found it bland, and rushed through it just to get to the end, hoping it would get better, which is didn't.  For someone who did so much research, she should have made it more interesting 
 The present model is not the newest available and it has the disadvantage of hurting the nose by prolonged use. The newest presentation has solved this problem 
 DO NOT BUY THIS EXPECTING THE LID IN THE DESCRIPTION! I never recieved the lid described in the description section.  They had a similar skillet in colors for less.   Skillet is a quality weight anodized aluminum. It has what seems to be a high quality nonstick interior. The comfort handle has a good feel and is oven safe to 450 degrees.  CON The cushion handle means you CANNOT use in a broiler. No top browning your omelet in the broiler 
 This was a bitter disappointment.  One of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control.  However, if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting, we get horrific feedback (screeching).  Nothing seems to help and when I sent a note to the manufacturer for advice, I never received an answer.  Unfortunately I'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem, so it looks like it'll hit the trash.  Save your money and don't purchase this item 
 I have always struggled with lighting.  I hoped this book would help me, but it didn't.  I'm very frustrated by the lack of good lighting books out there.  If you know nothing of MAX or lighting, then this book will probably be of some use to you, but if you want to learn advanced lighting techniques, this book isn't for you.  
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 Color is such an important element in Mr. Scharf's work that it's difficult to believe this monograph was published without it.  There is not a single color photograph aside from the cover.  And the book is so tiny [Dimensions (in inches): 0.26 x 7.85 x 5.28]  that color photographs wouldn't do Mr. Scharf's work justice anyway.  I recommend that interested parties try to find a copy of one of his out-of-print books at their local library.  Mr. Scharf's work is amazing, and well worth viewing in full color, as he intended it to be viewed 
 I adore Ishiguro.  I was bereft when I finished The Remains of the Day.  Thought A Pale View of Hills was fabulous.  I absolutely abhorred the Unconsoled.  I confess, I read to enjoy myself.  I have a degree in English literature.  I don't have a problem with analysis, but this was too much work to get any enjoyment out of it at all 
 Anyone familiar with Charlie Haden's duo or trio work might be dissapointed by American Dream. Haden has always managed to express sentiment without added sweetner but this recording is over the top on production and orchestration.  Think of a jazz version of the abysmal Elvis Costello/Bert Bacharach outing.  Some of the best contemporary American jazz musicians, Haden, Keith Jarrett, Pat Metheny, etc. have kept their distance from the easy listening and retro styles that dominate "popular" jazz radio while still creating accessable music, moody, thoughful and often beautiful.  They share that ECM avant-garde edge with European counterparts like Tomasz Stanko, Bobo Stenson, Tord Gustavsen and Keitel Bjornstad.  Unfortunately, American Dreams is a lot closer to Yanni than to The Liberation Orchestra. 
 My Dad bought this magazine for my mom and I usually pick up the copies to browse them.  That is all both my mom in her fifties and I in my twenties do browse it as it is a joke.  It is not that special it is chucked full of ads.  The cover stories are dull and boring and many of the articles you would want to read have about one paragraph good information.  I find this magazine a waste of our money.  It will not be getting renewed at the end of the subscription.  My mom has already stated that.  
 ...with LSD in order to enjoy this movie. As many have said, the idea is interesting. Psychotic telepaths revolt against a defense contractor studying them for use as a war weapon. The story told is nonsensical, fantastic, and confusing, though. The acting is beyond the pale. The explodyhead scene is about as cool as this movie gets, I'm afraid. It's somewhat fun to watch Patrick Mcgoohan and Michael Ironside mug their way through the terrible script, I guess. The audio effects of the people talking in the scanners' heads might tempt the chemically impaired to think this movie is awwwwesome as well.  Maybe if I viewed this as something of an abstraction I could have suspended my disbelief with some of the logical chasms in the film, but as a linear, plot-driven movie this was El Bombola. Cronenberg is a daring director, always willing to explore the strange and perverse, but I'd call Scanners fairly overrated for those who would rate it highly at all 
 There is no measure how harmful and disastrous this "sermon" has been to all who have read or heard it.  The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation (eternal torment) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago.  The first century church never believed in a "hell".  The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from  pagan religions of the world.  "Hell" was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and "converting" effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as "orthodox" centuries after the resurrection of Christ.  Our English translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact, when it is actually fiction.  Mostly all English versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Young's Literal propagate this fallacy.  Do your homework.  Go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up.  If you scoff then here is your challenge.  Do the research from a non-traditional, non-pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise God about.  Other HIGHLY recommended books are "The Inescapable Love of God" by Thomas Talbott (ISBN: 1581128312, not on Amazon, you must google it), "The Origin and History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment" by Thomas Thayer, "The Bible Hell" by Dr. John Wesley Hanson.  Go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what "hell" is and where it came from.  You will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out.  All those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on, to you I say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of God that it creates.  THAT is hell indeed, and THAT is the ONLY hell that exists 
 I would really like to know the average age of the reviewers who rated this book favorably.  I read 210 pages and finally had to quit. I just couldn't keep reading. The writing is very unimaginative. The authors have a very limited use of vocabulary - the sentences are short and stilted and they often use the same adjectctive or other words repeatedly to describe a scene  or other point of the book.  Once you pick up on this you can't help but notice it over and over throughout the book.  The resemblance to Lord of the Rings is almost laughable. At one point the 'kender' character (which would be the hobbit) says something like "I used to own a magic ring once - have I told you about it?"  Duh!!!  Another thing that is really annoying is the authors constant use of exclamation points. Instead of using clever and sophisticated writing to make a point - the use short sentences punctuated throughout with exclamation points. Again- once you notice it, there is no ignoring it and it becomes more and more irritating. Where were the editors???  Young adults may find this book interesting - which is scary - as for me this shows what poor writing it takes to get someone to claim a book is one of the best they've read.  It will be a long time before I give another Weis/Hickman book a chance. My time is too valuable to waste it on such poor writing 
 Contentwise, I won't toss darts OR roses. This is genre stuff. You either like it or you don't. My beef is with the technical quality. It is execrable. (1) It is NOT in widescreen (Cinemascope), which it ought to be for a biblical spectacular. There is simply no excuse for cranking out a full-screen treatment in a DVD issued in the year 2000. (2) The so-called "digital remastering" must be kitchen-table grade, because the shapes are fuzzy, colors oversaturated, visuals mushy. This DVD should be withdrawn from the market and a new widescreen version substituted. I get better quality from my VHS of this movie than the DVD I purchased. Lousy lousy lousy, as I said. 
 CoT is a rather disjointed attempt at a historical narrative that I strongly suspect was culled from a dozen or so different journals from settlers. This is not well done history and a rather tiresome read. I found it amazing that there was almost no discussion of the culture or way of life of the aborigines. The discussion of the English settlers seems to focus on sex and punishment. What about the organization of the colony? How did the colonists manage their day-to-day lives to survive those first worst years?  For anyone who has a serious interest in history, CoT misses the mark by a wide margin. Not recommended 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 This text is very eccentric. I had to read it for an English class, and there was a mix of different reviews. Some loved it, some hated. I myself could not get through all of it (though I did make it to page 223). I suppose that the best way to tackle this novel is to realize that narrative is a big part of it, as well as is magic realism. The line between fact and fiction almost does not exist here. Logic cannot be applied when reading this novel. What is fact, what is fiction? Try to not distinguish the two while reading it and you may find yourself getting through it much more smoothly than I did. 
 It's about time someone stands up and says : "red scare is all about mean politicans and innocents writers", "soviet spies never existed". That movie is telling us just that, by completely ignoring the spionage problem and the Corea war. One thing is particularly shocking, let's think of the millions of the victims of the Gulag when we see Stalin's poster in Streisand's room. "Freedom of speech will never exist in this country", says Redford-Pollack ; i just wish you were born in USSR, you criminal. 
 Although I applaud the fact that Zhang Yi-mou can portray a love story without reverting back to sexual escapades, this moving is just plain boring! When you are watching it it takes forever and there is also this 30 min. snooze of an intro he takes explaining the background for the lovestory between his parents. Goodness gracious do something!  Zhang zi-yi does a great job of prancing about in her pigtails, but I too am flabbergasted as to  how his parents ever fell in love. Unbelievably, they said like two words to each other before deciding they loved each other. i dont call that a great love story, I call it a 3rd grade lunch recess fling 
 I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables.  Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper.  Just ridiculous.  The Airport Express itself is fantastic, but skip this accessory and go to your local Radio Shack for the mini-RCA cable, and a quick search online for the optical to mini 
 I purchased this opener 12/6/06 and the motor quit 3/5/07.  What really troubles me is that I probably only open five or six cans a week.  Please don't waste your money 
 This book was not informative at all.  I started to read the reviews after I bought the book just to make sure I was not the only one who was not impressed with the book.  I took the suggestion of other readers and bought Baby Bargain.  Now this is a wonderful book.  I can't put it down, originally when I bought I was planning to just skim though and read what I thought was important but the advice was so good that I had to start reading the book from the beginning to make sure I wasn't missing out on any good tips 
 a friend of mine recommended this book a while ago and i decided to give it a try. what a waste of time! after a so-so start it dissolves into a silly, improbable, absolutely unbelievable mess, the conclusion being particularly stupid  and unrealistic. if you want to do yourself a favour, stay with patricia highsmith instead 
 Okay, I confess: I was amused by this book, and since I suspect that that was most of its intention, perhaps I'm being too harsh in giving it only two stars. And yes, there were some legitimately thought-provoking ideas to be found...but only a few. If you can find this book used, cheap, as I did, it's definitely worthwhile for a lark. But there is DEFINITELY NOT enough book here to be worth list price. It is grossly overpriced to capitalize on the Star Trek market, and that's the source of my dissatisfaction 
 This is the first Rosalind Miles book I have read, and I am not moved to read another. The language was so very hokey that it was painful to read at times. The book was filled with dull characters, cliche descriptions, and overly dramatic scenes like a B movie script. I was very disappointed 
 I have read every novel in the Sharon McCone series and have them all in my collection.  When I found this book at Barnes and Noble and read the description I was giddy with anticipation.  I wanted to read about the relationship between Sharon and Hy as man and wife.  I was very disappointed.  The plot line is basic and good.  A daughter wants to find her mother who disappeared over twenty years ago.  Closure is all she wants although her sister would just as soon let it be.  Thus begins the chase all around the northern California coast, ending in Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Whew!  So little time was spent in San Francisco that the office people who I have come to know and adore, were virtually non-existent.  Most of the conversation is stilted and the majority is done over the telephone.  The cell phone being turned off is a recurring distraction.  Is this supposed to have an allegorical meaning?  I don't know.  Sharon's adopted mother and biological mother rate a paragraph or two in the novel.  Hy appears once or twice and I highly doubt that a newly married man would allow his wife to be so distant from him.  Irregardless of their "evolved" relationship, I think it was cold on Sharon's part to proceed on her own when she has such available talent at the home office, just waiting for such an assignment.    My main complaint about this novel is there are two many one-dimensional characters.  I got so confused as to who was who and how they were relevant to the story.  I never got to "know" them and motivations were sometimes so closeted I was in the dark.  There was a very good potential plot in the Mark Aldin/Ricky relationship and yet it was briefly dealt with in sentences.  His death was related by phone call.  (again, the phone)    Hence the title of my review, the point vanished.  I was bored reading the book and just was not interested nor did I particularly care what happened to Laurel Greenwood.  I don't think she was intelligent enough to do what she did and I do not think she was an artist.  I will read the next book in the series and if it presents the same types of problems for me, I will probably give up reading them as I gave up on VI Warshawski years ago.  When you don't like the main character, no point in reading the novel 
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
 The reader who said this book is challenging hit the nail right on the head. It is indeed very challenging to read this book and realize that it is written under non-fiction. Like Michael Moore's "documentary" which was more fiction than fact, American Dynasty should be listed under fiction not non-fiction. Of course the left wing liberals will like this book as much as they like all of the  other mindless, factless, feelgood garbage that permeated book store shelves up untill 13 months ago and were proven to be baseless nonsense. Some people want to believe which is to say, they probably want to believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and The Tooth Fairy too.  You can skip this one 
 An extremely dry textbook filled with insults to the female gender. Not a good book, not even for basic research purposes. You're better off going out and buying the actual translations of the works it makes mention of 
 The 1st 2 flicks have come on gone...World at War gets LEFT BEHIND(pun intended). I hoped I'd never see the day when I'd have to give an attempted prophecy movie thumbs down, but here we have it. To keep it short and sweet, many of the same characters are present from the 1st 2 films(which were true to the book), however, this poses a great disappointment for fans expecting to see an adaptation of book 3, as Cloud 10 veers away from the continuum of the book series. It's a story within itself and the story seems to be thrown together. Definately not a keeper...stick to the first 2 and then add The Moment After and SIX:The Mark Unleashed to your collection instead. 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 I purchased this DVD mainly for the Hip Hop sections.  I was very disappointed to find out there is no Hip Hop dancing on this DVD.  Madonna Grimes is the instructor for the Hip Hop section but it is basic aerobics and floor exercises.  
 It holds my bike but seems unstable - I still can't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car, and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards.  Plus, probably the biggest concern - there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack (user must tie the bike down every time).  My bike hasn't fallen off though.. 
 It will be easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. Well Patty Boy I hope you have been training one hell of a camel because otherwise you are going to be mighty hot for an eternity. This man is a intolerant bigot. 
 Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D 
 I am not impressed with Tiffen filters I got in this set.  The finish of the rings are poor.  Despite of previously poor reputaion, I recently purchased some 67mm Quantaray filter from the local Ritz Camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of Tiffen filters.  I never got Tiffens before, had good experience with Hoyas.  I will probably stay with those from now on.  Now come to think of it, Ritz camera indicated the Quantaray they had were made by Hoya.   The glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the Hoyas and the Quantarays.  Not a good sign. The circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off.  Quite frustrating.  All of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them, not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame, but none of the other filters I got before had this kind of problem right out of the box. The set might be cheap, but it sure is for a good reason 
 My son was very disappointed when he received this item.  It looks nothing like the picture.  The picture shows a whole container of viewers and you receive one baby blue view with a swirly sticker instead of the eye as in the picture.  I believe this is false advertising, and everyone should be aware of this.  I wanted to give it half a star, but it was not available 
 I can fully understand the bad reviews given about S. Beauty. (not as bad a 1 or 0 stars)  Eric Bruann's songs here may not be the best, but his voice & guitarmanship is worthy of hearing.  The cd to buy from this area of IB (74-75) is clearly Sun & Steel, a very good cd that contains 2 of the best IB songs I ever heard: "Beyond The Milky Way" & "Watch The World Goin' By" 
 I have not bought this particular video, but I did buy another set of GGW videos a few months ago, and I COMPLETELY regret it.  This is the worst purchasing experience I've ever had.  Many people have complained about the horrible customer service at GGW.  In my case, I paid extra on my order for speedy delivery.  The charge went against my credit card, so they got immediate payment from me.  My videos were supposed to have been delivered within a couple days, but it wound up taking a couple MONTHS instead!  And only after I complained did they finally deliver them.  But they still didn't reimburse me for the extra expense I had paid for the speedy delivery that never happened.  And if that isn't bad enough, for the last month these jerks have been calling me every day, several times a day.  I get calls at home, I get calls at work.  They called me three times just today.  This is harrassment!  I'm right now researching what my legal options are because their incessant phone calls are making me crazy.  Can you imagine having to explain unsolicited calls you're receiving at work from GGW?  Unless you want to go through the hell I'm being put through, do yourself a favor and please avoid these sorry jerks 
 Very small print size, poor quality printing and mediocre paper detract. . .  
 I had high hopes for this huge undertaking, and ended up sorely disappointed.  Opinion is passed off as fact, lots of information is incorrect, and the typos and grammatical errors are HORRIBLE!  This is what happens when you reach for the stars, and fail.  Save your money 
 he gets 2 for 2 good songs in the whole cd!this cd blows 
 The book made a huge impression on me 35 years ago. I fell in love with the story and was envious of Sam's year in the wilderness.  Last night, I found the movie for sale at a local book/music/DVD store. I vaguely remembered that My Side of the Mountain had also been a movie way back when, but I had forgotten all about it. I bought the movie and my wife and I watched it.  Ugh. This movie was a waste of time. It was poorly written, abysmally acted, and strayed so far from the book that it was virtually unrecognizable to anyone who read and loved the book.  My wife and I got the impression that the movie was adapted by someone who doesn't like hunting or killing of animals. Reference after reference was made in the movie to guns and hunters being bad, killing animals being bad and even Frightful was killed by a hunter apparently out shooting for sport. So Sam never got his deerskin outfit (as he did in the book). Instead, he bought leather gloves and wore some kind of yellow rain slicker during the winter.  At one point near the end, when Bando returned to visit, there were so many people in Sam's hollowed out tree that I could have sworn it was a magic tree, much like the magic tents in the latest Harry Potter movie. Small from the outside. But huge on the inside.  What an awful movie. Even the cinematography was horrid. If I had to watch Frightful fly around for minutes on end one more time I might have shot her myself.  Avoid this movie at all costs!  But please, do, read the book. It's one of the best children's' novels ever published 
 I went through this cookbook after going through the new Southern Living Slow Cooker Cookbook and what a disappointment! Not only does this book use many pre-packaged items (if I'm making it myself, I'd rather not use that junk), the recipes were dull. Almost every recipe was in the other cookbook and was MUCH better. I also purchased the More Betty Crocker Slow Cooker Recipes and MANY of the recipes were the same--picture and all! What a waste of money. Purchase the new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook and you'll be MUCH happier 
 Like Mr. Lee I hold a top secret clearance and I'm an Asian-American. What I don't understand is why Mr. Lee kept some contacts with foreign nationals by attending unclassified seminars/ meetings. These kinds of contacts are frown upon. Even though the information in his papers was deemed unclassified by LANL, he should have known the mere act of these exchanges raises red flags. Was he showing off his knowledge by presenting his technical papers? He should have been less naive about the whole business of working in a top secret environment. Was he naive or stupid? It's people like him that give Asian-Amricans like me a bad name and puts us under severe scrutiny. 
 I had to return this.  The poetry in the book was very nice, but the pictures were too abstract I think for a preschooler to grasp, and not particularly compelling for me as an adult who not only uses preschool nature books professionally but also collects them as a hobby.  
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but I felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds.  I didn't realise so much of the book was focused on diet.  It says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be.  Well the first 13 weeks I managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to try to gain weight.  The book said that according to my starting weight I should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy!  I decided to stop reading the book, and so far, just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when, I've managed to put on 20 pounds.  My twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy.  This book isn't horrible, but I would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used, don't spend the $ on a new one... and be prepared to put it down if it doesn't sound right to you 
   Some people write for the "art crowd." Dense outpourings of words that some of lesser human (like me) find nonsensical; but the really artsy types find fascinating. Perhaps because, like the crowd surrounding the naked emperor, they are afraid of simply telling the truth.    Europe Central is a collection of stories about "the warring authoritarian cultures of Germany and the USSR," wherein according to jacket blurb, the author "compares and contrasts the moral decisions made by various figures from this period - some famous, some infamous, some unknown."    It simply doesn't work, at least not for this reader.    It's overblown, pretentious and far too wordy (just like good proletarian novels about real life are supposed to be).    And it's dreadfully slow reading and, for the most part, boring. Once in a while, something interesting appears, like a rock formation popping out of an otherwise flat plain.    In the hands of someone like Alan Furst, the theme might have worked, though the book would far shorter than this doorstop's 752 ponderous pages. On the whole, you can pass this by and move on with your life.  Jerr 
 I purchased this item because of the song "Believe."  It turns out that it is the only memorable song on the CD, and the only one worth listening to.  I should have waited until there was a downloadable MP3 version of it 
 Call me whatever you will, but I did NOT "get" this book.  jg 
 If the criteria applied by the Jesus Seminar were applied to all ancient writing we would have no history, only a phantasm based on political ambitions and an extremely skeptical view of human nature.  There is certainly a more objective and postitive view when applying a hermenutic.  The inconsitencies of the gospels pointed out by textual and contextual criticism only go to validate the authenticity of the message and the humanity of its transmission.  If biblical facts and grammar aligned to the degree of the criteria set forth by the Jesus Seminar "scholars", I would conjecture the argument would be the same but with the opposite criteria!  No, the Jesus seminar is not applying a science, but an inductive argument with claims based on evidence with an agenda that provides no real warrant for the inference.  How about spending our mental energy on applying ethics to government 
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
 32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad. 
 Although I truly enjoy Louie Prima's music, this DVD does not due him justice.  The sound and picture quality is poor. The performances are old and all in BLACK & WHITE!! The only parts in color are the commentary and the cemetary photo where he is buried.  Better to just buy a CD and listen to him perform. This DVD is way overpriced for its poor quality. I do not recommend unless you just want anything and everything there is available on Louie Prima, no matter what the quality is like. I was very disappointed 
 This book should have been a hard back and it isn't! I will be returning it as the order was incorrect 
 In all fairness I was looking for a different book -- when I got this in the mail it wasn't what I expected.  Though the title would have you believe it would be a suitable replacement.  I was planning to drive from LA to San Diego and was looking for some cool landmarks.  Well each state gets 2 pages, so you can image the ideas I got for stopping points.  Zero.  I looked up Massachusetts, my home, and all it seemed to talk about was Howard Johnson's.  Given HoJo's has burned a place in local memory and was an important early player in the motel business,  no evidence exists of it today.  So bad road trip book.  Mildly interesting history book 
 I find it hard to believe that the author has even visited Cuba, let alone lived there. Not being an American, I have legally spent quite a bit of time in Havana myself - and not as a tourist, either - and there are so many glaring inconsistencies between this book and the realities it describes, I would have sworn it was written by someone who was only going on third-party descriptions and their own wild imagination.  Jineterismo is indeed a gaping wound in Cuban society, but it certainly doesn't work the way this book describes it - quite far from it. There is a lot of uncommon ground between Cuban-style jineterismo and generic western-type prostitution, and this author's take is remarkably closer to the second one. To give an example: no Cuban jinetera would be "sitting by herself" anywhere, let alone at a "cafe near the Habana Libre Hotel," and with a "stack of papers" in front of her no less. That picture is straight out of the US, and anyone doing said things in Cuba would never, ever be mistaken for anything other than a foreigner, not even by the naivest American tourist. More importantly, the jineteras sell romance more than they sell sex, which is amongst the most alluring things about them. One may pay them, but one is always left with the impression that they're being generous and "helping out" someone with whom they had a good time, not contemptuously paying a professional for services rendered as described in the book.  The book may be enjoyable as a read - I don't know, as personally I was unable to finish it for being so annoyed with the false picture it paints. My own impression is that it is naive and rather sophomoric. If you do choose to read it, please keep in mind it is pure fiction. If a literary glimpse into modern-day Cuba (shocking underworld included) is what you're after, there are far better books out there by Cuban authors, and even an excellent relevant collection of short stories and book excerpts 
 I am an avid reader and have never once submitted a book review.  However, after reading Botox Diaries, I felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull, trite, and disjointed.  I love my "chick-lit" books, but Botox Diaries is a disgrace to this genre.  The plot is weak and unrealistic (even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords "lite & fun" books).  The plot is also disjointed, perhaps because two authors co-wrote this book.  The characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull.  Botox Diaries is absolutely the worst book I have ever read.  -- December 2005 Update:  My friend insisted on reading this book (ugh...despite my warnings!). Even though she was stuck in the airport for eight hours, she still couldn't bear to finish the book, because she found it so dull. She actually left it, half-read, at the airport 
 I like reading.  I am a literature snob.  I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!).  But, I think I've met my match in this novel.  I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down.  I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.        HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.        I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!   
 I have used pedometers for a few years. I was initially impressed with this pedometer BUT then I discovered the 360 I received did not always 'wake' and keep track of steps. The 360 I received did not always count steps even when already 'awake.' The 'sleep' 'wake' feature is bogus, it does not work and it makes this pedometer a loser. I would not be surprised if other users of this pedometer have simply overlooked the fact that their steps might not be getting counted because the pedometer is stuck in sleep. Heartrate Monitors, the company I bought it from was not responsive when I asked for guidance. I bought another pedometer from a different dealer, the Sportline 345 - It's my second 345, need I say more 
 I concur with those who complain about finding music on this player.  It is cumbersome and timeconsuming.  Moreover, the screen is very small. In attempting to delete songs, the player frequently freezes, making it necessary to remove it from the USB port.  I regret buying this one.  
   Nothing is so disgusting as an author who creates in his own mind, regardless of the evidence, some historical gobbledgook under the guise of science.  Price totally ignores Venona files(1992) evidence that McCarthy saved the United States and totally destroyed Soviet plans for the internal overthrow of the US government.   This book is destined for the garbage bin appropriately named "inaccurate historical fiction. 
 'the executioner's song' holds the dubious title of the worst book I ever read cover to cover. seriously. it's tedious, massively overlong, mawkish, trite, trivial and badly written. in fact, it was a milestone in my reading- I never just trusted an author to pull it all together again. now I just drop a book if it's going as badly as this one did.  the only remarkable thing about Gilmore is that he insisted the death penalty be applied to him, even tho it wasn't mandatory in that state anymore. Mailer fails to come to any significant conclusion about this, despite having a whopping 1072 pages in which to do it.  basically, Gilmore is a run-of-the-mill petty criminal, with relationship troubles. he gets caught after killing two men in a botched hold-up. he gets 'life', but instead insists on being executed. he gets executed. the end. there- you don't need to waste your time reading it now- the book draws no further conclusions about his motivation, the ethics of the death penalty, the morals of crime, or indeed anything at all. poppycock 
 This book is an exmaple of the "new emperor clothes" effect. Only the 'clever' people can 'understand' it, and other people are afraid to say that don't undertsand, because then they will not be regarded  clever 
 No plot...hard to understand...a total snore fest...If u care about whoever Carlos Fuentes is writing about...go ahead, read it...but don't blame me if you fall asleep...horrible...horribl 
 I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year. I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy. 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 As a high school teacher I am always looking for a good YA book to use as a Directed Reading Lesson for my students to get them more interested in reading for pleasure. I had heard good things about, City of Bones, so I bought it.  I wish I could give it a good review, but I cannot. Why? There are two reasons and I will explain them.  One, as a teacher, I could not in good faith say with a straight face to a parent that this book was age appropriate for *any* high school student, unless they were over 17 years old and in a Gifted and Talented program. Meaning I consider this to be an R-rated book (if we were going by movie standards).   And before you label me some right-wing Bible-thumping conservative, I am the direct opposite of that. But I know what PARENTS want their *children* to read and I don't think this book is it. I think the book's target age should be 17 and up, so that lets out all my 9th, 10th and 11th (and some of my 12th) grade students.  And why do I think my students who are under 17 shouldn't be reading City of Bones? Because of the violence and sexual content (incest factor and  the homoerotic content). I would have a hard time explaining to any parent or my local school board why I was reading a book to my students about a boy who French-kissed his sister in a scene.   And while *I* have no problem with homoerotic content in movies and books (see my other reviews *g*), I think most parents do not want their underage children reading about that topic without some discussion beforehand. And quite frankly it just isn't my job as an instructor to explain homosexuality to students, that is their parent's job.   The second problem with the book besides not being able to use it in a classroom or school setting because of the above discussed problems, is that the plot lacks orginality. This is another factor I must have when I pick a book for my students. I want them to read about something exciting and *new.*  City of Bones is fast-paced, but its characters are all ones we've seen before. The main female character, Clary, is a cross between Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Leia from Star Wars. Just as Jace is Luke from Star Wars and Angel from Buffy. And if Simon isn't Xander from Buffy, I'll eat my hat. Plus Hodge is Giles (and a little Albus Dumbledore, complete with bird thrown in for good measure). Isabelle is Cordelia from Buffy and Alec is Draco from Harry Potter -- who is in love with Jace. Plus my favorite rip-off is Valentine, the bad guy. He's Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine all rolled in one. Get it, Palpatine = Valentine?   As a huge Star Wars fan if I saw one more Star Wars reference I was going to write to George Lucas and tell him he should be getting royalities on this book!  So, if you were thinking of buying this book for your teenager, I would take a pass. If you were thinking of buying it for yourself and you are over 17, I would buy it with a grain of salt and know that you are not getting something new, but plots that have been used before (and much better in my opinion) 
 I read this book after coming across it on a "most important books ever" list. I found it very hard to get through. Approximately half-way through the book I found myself counting down the pages until I finished it. This is not a book to read if you're looking to be entertained, however if you're looking for a good bit of culture/history I would think this would be a decent pick. Some of the passages involving the main character and his love interest are very well written and beautiful to read. In fact, I re-read some of the passages again just for the majestic quality of the author's writing. As a college junior with little knowledge of or interest in African culture I did not enjoy reading this book, however I may try again in the future to see if I can get more out of what others have deemed a very important and worthy novel 
  Everything about the cover of Profoundly Disturbing - the shaky letters, the posed fright on the creased poster, the phony rating, the chapter titles mimicking credits, the dirty-looking border, and the display copy's warped cover, making it look used - fairly screams, "DON'T PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR THIS BOOK!"  (Fortunately, amazon has discounted it.)  When did paperbacks start costing $24.95?  Especially one by Joe Bob Briggs - has he abandoned his working-class supporters?  His earlier paperbacks were less than $10; even hardcover editions of Cosmic Wisdom and Iron Joe Bob weren't $20.  Why is this book's price so high?  A look inside shows where some of the cash goes.  Glossy pages that reflect the light's glare make it hard to find a comfortable reading position.  The text is split into two columns, divided and almost surrounded by red borders.  Little red movie-related symbols cross the top of each page.  Why the obsession with red?  Has Joe Bob gone Communist on us?  Movie posters introduce each chapter.  And some awful fonts are chosen for the first paragraph of, and various statements from, each chapter.  In short, style trumps substance.  Why does Joe Bob require special effects?  He IS a special effect.  Well, he was.  Here, he makes his case for the movies that most influenced public tastes and later film making, some of which are known more for promotional antics than artistic merits.  He discusses how the idea for each movie originated, summarizes the plots (revealing each ending so that if you've never seen the films, you'll not be interested now), attempts to interpret those movies that make no sense, tells why he thinks the movie is important, and goes over the careers of the key actors, directors and/or writers involved, scattering trivia throughout.  At the end of each chapter, a guide covers related movies, often repeating information from the chapter.  While competent, the writing rarely rises above standard research reporting, and often failed to maintain my interest.  For example, I took 3 breaks while reading about And God Created Woman.  Why would any red-blooded American man make Brigette Bardot boring?  In his Reservoir Dogs chapter, Joe Bob condones plagiarism.  Does it follow that he steals from other writers?  If so, who?  I thought his style and outlook were unique, but if not, I'd like to read what his victims wrote.  Citing sources is common courtesy:  copying for profit or glory is theft.  For the money, too much is missing from this book - say, about 150 pages.  The index is incomplete.  It lists only movies, ignoring all of the people involved, as well as the innovations introduced.  Maybe Joe Bob felt that his coverage of Deep Throat was getting (ahem) long, but he fails to note that Linda Lovelace's nipples are never shown in the movie.  He doesn't explain the 1969 Naked Came the Stranger hoax.  He claims that, other than Linda, Carol Conners and Harry Reems, Throat actors had no later roles:  he completely overlooks Dolly Sharp, who, as Gloria Leonard, appeared in several X-rated movies through the 1970s, including one that he mentions, The Opening of Misty Beethoven.  (She also published the glossy adult magazine High Society, and hosted an adult cable TV show in New York City.)  Deep Throat was probably Gloria's best performance, though; she subsequently refused any on-screen anal scenes.  Now that's disturbing!  Joe Bob asserts that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre introduced the chain saw as a weapon.  Not so - it was used a year earlier in Last House on the Left (granted, in self-defense).  He notes Saw's influence on metal bands, but neglects its effects on punk:  Johnny Rotten enjoyed the movie, and the first Ramones album includes a song about it.  Several more movies could have added bulk to this book, including The Birth of a Nation (1915), Birth Control and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (both 1917), Triumph of the Will (1935), M (1951, or the 1932 German version), Night of the Living Dead (1968), A Clockwork Orange (1971), Carrie (1976 - Joe Bob mentions a 1977 movie called Ruby, also featuring Piper Laurie, which reads like a Carrie rip-off), Caligula (1980), and Basket Case (1982).  Night of the Living Dead was mentioned in early promotions of this book, but that chapter must have been cut.   The most glaring omission, though, is Joe Bob himself.  After he temporarily quit writing in 1997, he seemed to have undergone a humor removal operation.  Where is the social commentary laced with his acerbic wit?  Where are such characters as Bobo Rodriguez, Cherry Dilday, and Rhett Beavers?  Where is his uncommon wisdom, so desperately needed in this country?  Apparently, they're all in his distant past.  H. L. Mencken estimated that a good writer has about 10 years of worthwhile work before he burns out.  Perhaps, then, we're lucky that Joe Bob provided a solid 15 years of refreshing, opinionated literature.  His writing used to provoke my delightfully shocked reaction, "Did he just SAY that?"  Throughout Disturbing, I kept wondering, "Why am I still reading this?"  Film scholars might find this book interesting.  To me, Profoundly Disturbing is primarily disappointing. 
 I love a good, fun, guilty pleasure type read as good as the next woman but this book had no point.  It was just silly.  It is fun to read books with these funny and extravagant characters when something actually happens.  This was more of a childish running commentary.  I got to the end and just wondered why even waste time writing something like this?  
 I found it hard to enjoy - I miss melody and don't care for strange arrangements and jazz motifs 
 OK, I've looked through all the other reviews on here, and I know that anyone who does the same will probably go with the looming majority vote and get this album but PLEASE DON'T!!! About a year ago I first heard Different Class and thought it was great. So much fun, excellent lyrics, and just really great! the melodies, the instrumentation...amazing. So recently I heard This Is Hardcore. A few of the songs are pretty good (Dishes, The Fear, The Day After The Revolution) but for the most part it's just plain BORING!!! Where did the fun go? This album is sad, dreary, and dull. Yes, it is a darker mood, and I realize that Jarvis Cocker probably had a reason to write such melancholy songs, but after hearing Different Class, who wants to listen to them? Many of the songs sound the same and, while not being terrible, were completely uninspiring. Buy Different Class instead. It rocks 
 Studying Eastern European histry, this book came as a shock to me for its lack of depth and truth concerning this region of Europe. The first constitutional monarchy in Europe, Poland, is given no credit for its Constitution of May 3rd, 1791. In fact, it's not even there at all. Other misleading factoids have the Lithuanian state 'defeating the Teutonic knights at Tannenberg', while in reality they only constituted about a third of the Polish force. So, in general, this book goes nowhere new; it overgeneralizes and misrepresents Eastern Europe while glorifying the big two; France and England 
 After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I thought "finally, a book on communication between couples from a male perspective." I was expecting a sympathetic account of the communication between the sexes but such an account was missing in this book.  This book is s not meant for any man born after about 1960. The gender stereotypes are still very strong (both male and female).  The book starts with some helpful suggestions (don't criticise too often, set a time aside to share criticism) but then quickly deterriorates into a rant about how men have not been treated fairly in the media. Topics covered included abuse within the family (men are abused too) and male-bashing in greeting cards. One important missing topic from this list is the villification of men as pedofiles-- especially men who enjoy working with children.   Of course men can be abused by their wifes, and father's by their children but it does not mean that male on female violence is "okay". Rather than making the non-sensical argument that "we hurt too, so your hurt is fine," the author should condemn abuse in all it's forms. Similarly making fun of men just because they are men, is as okay as making fun of women just because they are women.   I have also wondered why there are very few programs for male perpetrators of violence. Most resources are for women, and the way to solve family abuse, is for the woman to leave. Where are the centres to help men communicate non-violently? Why can't the family try and heal together? In the first part of the book, the author identifies that female "fear" is often translated into male "aggression"-- good point, but why is this point not carried onto the discussion of abuse?  Then there is a list of traditional "unnoticed" male work, including being an unpaid bodyguard "in public places (who plays bodyguard when nightfall turns a beautiful park into a dangerous park", just as well a woman can be an "unpaid massager" for rubbing her husband's shoulders. Most of the other "male work" is incredibly gender specific and even a quick read makes it clear that these are special events (putting up the Christmas lights) rather than day-to-day toil. I found this list offensive. We both cook dinners, use the barbaque and put up the Christmas lights.  There is also the male role of "option generating"-- man asks where they should go for dinner, woman says "anywhere", man says "italian?" etc. Apparently "option-generating often involves having one's ideas rejected, which can be emotionally taxing." The beauty of being in a couple is that both parties can create options and both can reject. It's called communication and making choices together.  More than that, I find it offensive that the author glosses over all the important work men do in families. Men now do change diapers, take pride in being fathers, cook, clean and are partners also in the home. How has this development passed the author by? By enforcing the gender stereotype of "the man brings in the bacon", the author is also glossing over all the men, who might like to stay at home with their children... or who would like to work part-time to have more family time. As well as of course all the women, who might like to have a career.  Many of these choices should be made in the family. Gender stereotypes are truly just as damaging to men, especially because they limit the choices that can be considered "acceptable". Why can a man not enjoy spending time with his children? Why does he need to be able to support the family? Should the responsibility not be shared? Where are the men, who are single parents? Male kindergarten teachers? Heaven forbid.  One more irritating passage: "We often think that when a man insults another man by calling him a 'girl', the insult reflects a contempt for women. No. It reflects a contempt for any man who is unwilling to make himself strong enough to protect someone as precious as a woman." hmmm. yeah... hmmm. This is where I started to laugh out loud. Too ridiculous for words.  In short: this book is not for anyone, who is trying to be a father in this century. Rather than solving anything, this book just perpetuates detrimental and dangerous gender stereotypes. Perhaps the author lives in this kind of a world (and indeed much of the material seems to stem from his personal experiences), but I don't know any young man who would... Rather young men now are facing the same challenges of work-life balance as young women are.  It's time to get beyond male-hating and female-hating, juxtaposing male needs and female needs to find somekind of a inherent conflict, and to understand that men and women can live together. And that in a family, men and women have the same goal-- of making their families as happy as they can. 
 I'm sure this book was great in the 90s, but this is the 21st century, when you can buy the fourth edition.  There has been a ton of advancement between 1994 and 2002 
 After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.  On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.  But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from "Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham." There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again 
 After taking my dog to a true dog behaviorist, he told me that  Cesar's "style" is something I should not adopt.  His "one size fits all...gotta show 'em who's boss" mantra is completely wrong.. My dog behaviorist is renowned in this part of the country and gives seminars on dog behavior in Japan, as well. He also heads the training for dogs who are taken into our local hospitals. I trust him completely... so I definitely question now what Cesar the "dog whisperer" has to offer. The person I am working with operates solely on the "reward" system.  
 This is not Dale Carnegie but just some amateurs trying to make some money out of the good name of Dale Carnegie. I think they are called Dale Carnegie Associates. lol.  I've listened to it twice through and know there is virtually nothing which will be of any use to anybody.  What it does, is take one of Dale Carnegie's principles, explain it in about 5% of the detail Dale Carnegie did, try to give a contemporary example and finish by going,  "You'll now be on the way to leadership mastery"  Its one for the bin.  There is this guy with a lisp reading part of it who is so fake getting enthusiastic over "filler" drivvle 
 The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many. 
 Good story and fast read but too much graphic sex.  I like my imagination better than all of the graphic details 
 Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.   The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.  The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.  The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?  I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.   If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.  
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 lack of talent leads to jealousy that inspired the author to create his "theories". 
 While "lost souls" had the unmistakable feeling of secretly discovering forgotten objects and finding traces of urban structures in the middle of a desolate summer field with your best friend while sharing chocolates from a lesser known ex-soviet republic, "some cities" has the feeling of your friend coming over to play gamecube and later call up people on the speakerphone seeing what's up, what's happening, maybe hooking up.  The evocative splendor of appropriately lined tracks 1 to 6 of "lost souls" is nowhere to be found here, yet is replaced by the efforts to sustain it of tracks 7 to 12, but with more giving up and less trying.  Is this a really bad album, does it deserve TWO stars? Well no, not if you don't rate it compared to it's first-most predecessor 
 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling.  The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head.  If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version.  
 Both of my  LaCie Big Disk Extremes have been returned to manufacturer within a year of purchase due to power issues. In each case I have lost time and valuable data (they reformat the drive after repair as stardard operating procedure). Lacie makes decent drives so this surprised me. Later models may have fixed the problem, but the LaCie Big Disk Extreme has issues. 
 I recently purchaced this book and returned it.  I attempted to study for the test by brushing up on the history.  Yes history!  Well, it was nonexistant in this book.  It was just a big fat tip book for scoring a 5 on the AP exam 
 The main point of this book is well supported with examples from "innovative" organizations.  However, I was continually under the impression that this was a 30 page research paper converted into a 200 page book.  How did the author accomplish this feat?  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  This book is full of redundancies, repetitions, summaries, and introductions that are all superfluous.  When you're done reading this book, you will know the examples of good innovators by heart because they are repeated in every chapter, sometimes multiple times 
 This review applies to the fourth edition  The good:  1.  Good introductory chapters on basic javascript. 2.  I've always wanted to know how to do those neat drop-down menus.  Now I can.  The bad:  1.  Exercises at the end of the chapters have no answers.  As in, if you can't figure it out, you're out of luck.  (or maybe it's on the website -- see below) 2.  The neat Virtual Fish Tank screen shown on the front of the book? You don't do that. (You do have some hover buttons, but that's better done in CSS now.) 3.  By the last chapters, it seems to be a bit of a reach.  Not sure I really care about creating a poker game. (Especially since I'd have to type several pages of code in -- see below) 4. Being that this was released in 2006, the HTML examples really ought to have been XHTML 1.0 Strict or XHTML 1.1.  There were more than a few things that would not pass validation in either of those types.  The UGLY:  The website is supposed to have the example code.  It does, but having tried on two different computers, the downloaded zip file is corrupted.  I've sent two emails to the publisher and heard nothing.  So a lot of time can be spent doing typing instead of learning.  No thanks.   
 This LITTLE Booklet does not provide comprehensive information about vitamins and minerals. Short questions and answers do not give enough information to be of any help.  You will be very disappointed with this booklet if you are searching for in depth guidance.  The title is very misleading. 
 Book Review The Slaves Shall Serve - Meditations on Liberty James Wasserman (2004)  When I bought this book, I had hopes that I had come to the end of a long search for a book that combined a genuine understanding of both politics and the occult.  That sense of hope mainly hinged on the fact that Wasserman is a Thelemite, one of the few modern esoteric traditions which I consider not fluffy.  Unfortunately, what I found was yet another magician who seems to have spent so long on the astral plane that he has been able to develop only the most superficial understanding of the social-political realm.  Wasserman has seen the smokescreen of liberal ideology for what it is... only to trade it for the most common and silly ideas put out by conservatives.  For example, while condemning the "liberal" notion of gun control, he states that he thinks Senator McCarthy was right, and believes than an invasion of blue-helmeted U.N. troopers is imminent.  One of the most amusing claims he makes is one parroted by right-wing talk-show host almost daily: that there is a leftist bias in mainstream media.  As evidence, he points out a Media Research Center report that found a 10-to-1 ration of "anti-gun" to "pro-gun" stories on major news channels between 7/1/97 and 6/30/99.  Well and good, but if the media is really so left-biased, then why did the same research organization find a *100-to-1* ratio of pro-war to anti-war stories in the months leading up to Gulf War II, at a time when the most conservative polls showed over half of all Americans opposing the war?  And if the media is so leftist, why do right-wing pundits like Newt Gingrinch and Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson all have their own talk shows while leading Left intellectuals like anarchist Noam Chomsky and socialist Howard Zinn find themselves confined to poorly-compensated tours between universities?   The gun-control essay is, in fact, the best-written and best-researched essay in the entire book.  There is another decent essay about Waco, but the documentary Waco: The Rules of Engagement, which Wasserman references, does a better job of laying out the horrors that the U.S. government carried out there.  The others I find to be rather groundless opinion papers with few convincing arguments to back them up.  The book is further weakened by the fact that these essays comprise a little under half of the book - the second half is a reprinting of the U.S. and U.N. Constitutions with some minor notes and observations tacked on.  The book sells for $20, a rather steep price for about 100 pages of original writing, especially for such superficial analysis.  I'm sure Mr. Wasserman really does cherish the idea of freedom, but I'm not sure he entirely understands it.  He condemns both collectivism and democracy!  "Would you really want the post office to run the world?" he asks, to which the True Libertarian (i.e. Anarchist, from whom the so-called libertarian party mis-appropriated the term) responds with a resounding Yes!  The post office is a perfect example of how a non-centralized federation of autonomous communities could function.  There is no central high command for the post office, but if you put a letter to Prague in a mailbox in San Francisco, it will get there.  Wasserman also defends the idea of a republic, saying that true democracy is like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.  Well, that goes to show that you can prove anything by allegory.  If we inject a little realism into this allegory, we can see how quickly it disintigrates though.  First of all, nowhere in nature will you find two wolves for every sheep.  Common sense tells you that this is impossible.  And even if wolves did outnumber sheep, it has been shown that even these fierce predators practice- not survival of the fittest!- but mutual aid, that other important anarchist principle.  If a member of the pack is sick or injured, the pack doesn't abandon it, but shares food to try and keep it alive.  The individualism which Wasserman so often invokes sounds to me more like egoism, which, unless I am mistaken, is the enemy in Thelema.  Perhaps that is why he feels the need to justify his worldview with a divine power as the basis for morality.  His position just doesn't hold up on its own.  The fact is, the whole liberal/conservative split is itself just a smokescreen put up to hide the true agenda of those in power, the heads of the multinational corporations whose GDPs are larger than those of almost every country in the world, and whose transactions in fact make up a large percentage of the GDP of the world's superpowers.  Both "liberal" and "conservative" presidents have obediently carried out the secretive and undemocratic World Trade Organization's program of "neoliberal" economic reforms.  NAFTA, for example, was dreamed up by Reaganites, refined under Bush Sr., put into action by Clinton, and then further expanded under Bush Jr.  More than the U.N. coming to take away your guns, Mr. Wasserman, you should be concerned about the WTO coming to take away your food, your water, and your livelihood through programs which no bullet can damage 
 I was interested in discovering true debate among equals regarding certain "archaeological facts" as promised. However, quickly into the book I discovered that the debate was not among equals and the authors' questions often omitted substantive scientific support for the current postion. This book would be best classified under the title: Pop archeological fiction. It seemed like a covert way of introducing intelligent design into a scientific argument 
 If you are looking to find out about the IMAP protocol - This book is very good, I bought it to help me install the Cyrus imap server. The book covers the installation of cyrus but it does not cover the prerequisites. I found the hardest part of setting up the Cyrus server was dealing with the software prerequisites, i.e. tcl and cyrus sasl.  If you are interested in learning about the IMAP protocol, this is the book, if you are interested in setting up Cyrus - save your money 
 What a great cast!  I mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie, right?  After it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it, although you are shaking your head in disbelief!  Stunning!  You've never seen anything quite like it!  If you are a fan of the campy awful, you may see it as a masterpiece, if not you will still have a unique viewing experience. Proceed at your own risk!  Borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it. Did I mention the great cast?  So many of my favorites...even Goodman can't save this clunker 
 I liked the product until it showed a small split in the bottom and developed a slow leak after only a few uses.  Perhaps the plastic doesn't tolerate boiling water as well as it should 
 The very first thing you read in this book is a mistake.  The Prologue begins with a photo of German POWs at the end of WWI.  The photo caption states that the German Army at the end of WWI was "unbroken" and implies that Germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its political leadership.  This is doubly misleading.  The German Army was soundly defeated on Western Front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate.  In 1918, Germany was essentially a military dictatorship run by Ludendorff and Hindenberg.  The political leaders who lost will were the German High Command.  Defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of senior commanders hardly meets the description of an unbroken army.  Keegan is essentially repeating the pernicious "stab in the back" myth used by the German military and right wing propagandists to undermine the Weimar republic.  Its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on such matters.   This type of error recurs throughout this book.  My favorite relatively minor error is Keegan moving the Ploesti oilfields, a major strategic resource, from Romania to Hungary.  See prior reader reviews for documentation of a number of factual errors of varying magnitude.  Just as important and in some cases even more important are Keegan's failures to discuss crucial aspects of WWII.  He makes little effort, for example, to discuss the origins of the war.  Indeed, his paragraphs on this topic suggest that he finds it too confusing to discuss.  Leaving aside his shirking of his obligation to discuss this crucial topic, there are excellent overviews of 20s and 30s that are good guides to this admittedly formidable topic.  Instead of an effort to discuss the origins of the war, we get a superficial and somewhat misleading discussion of how industrialization transformed military technology and organization.  Instead of a discussion of the sad history of the Weimar Republic, crucial for understanding the ascent of the Nazis, we get another misleading discussion of the Freikorps phenomenon.  Among other significant omissions are his failure to grapple with the possible strategic significance of the Allied bombing campaign against Germany, a issue analyzed insightfully by Richard Overy in 2 of his excellent books.  Keegan's discussion of the Holocaust in both inadequate and implicitly misleading.  Partly because he doesn't discuss the origins of the war and the role played by Nazi ideology in starting the war he fails to show that in crucial respects the Holocaust was the point of German aggression.  The Nazis went to war not just to overturn the Versailles settlement or even to conquer Eastern Europe, but to impose their bizarre notions of racial conflict on the rest of Europe.  Without this background, its impossible to understand the outbreak and the specific nature of WWII.  Among other things, Nazi racism prevented them from rationally exploiting the resources of the western Soviet Union, a factor in their eventual defeat.  As pointed out by other reviewers, Keegan devotes a disproportionate amount of the book to activities of the Western allies when the Eastern front was really the crucial theatre.   To be fair to Keegan, writing a concise 1 volume book like this is very difficult.  The best 1 volume work on WWII is Gerhard Weinberg's book, which is about 1000 pages of text in a fairly small font.  Some of the individual sections of this book are quite good and Keegan has a nice, sometimes actually elegant, writing style.  None of these positive features, however, can overcome his neglect of basic features of WWII and the lack of attention to basic facts.  This is not just error, this is actual negligence.   
 The unique screen chemistry between John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn barely elevates a Western rehash of "The African Queen." Without Wayne and Hepburn, this belated sequel to "True Grit" wouldn't pass muster as a made-for-TV movie. It's too bad Peter Bogdanovich didn't take up the Duke's offer to direct the project -- he might have improved upon Martha Hyer's routine script. This was Wayne's next-to-last Western, but he would end his career in a blaze of glory with "The Shootist" (1976) 
   Their first book was actually helpful, and a bit of a novelty. It offered a different approach to cleaning that was geared toward the genetically disorganized, designed by genuine slobs. This was refreshing compared to a lot of the organizational books written by the naturally and freakishly organized trying to feign empathy for their inferior readers.    However, this book doesn't have anything new to say. I felt like I was wasting time reading it because so much of the book was devoted to the authors going into detail about their personal family problems, which really doesn't help the dishes in my sink, laundry on my couch and the Polly pockets on the floor waiting patiently to embed themselves in an unsuspecting foot.   I get the distinct impression that this book was an excuse for them to make more money. But, it does rehash their original ideas, which were all useful. Their first one was their best one, but this is better than nothing. 
 Schwartz is a new-ager who believs in ghosts, psychics, and talking to the dead, and he says these things can be proven scientifically. Why must people who believe in goofball ideas try to legitimize them by using scientific terms? They must believe no reasonable person would believe them otherwise, and they are right.  Unfortunately, the "scientific evidence" Schwartz presents would not impress a six-year-old. In his big "experiment" he got a guy named Chris who said he was psychic to write down some items he said he dreamed, such as a pile of tires and a bunch of umbrellas. Then they walked around town until they saw some tires and umbrellas. Wow, that's impressive. Schwartz was so impressed he says "I literally could not breathe" (page 20). I assume he dropped dead, but no, he went on another walk with Chris, who said he dreamed of seeing some trees and grass. You'll never guess what happened. They walked around until they saw some trees and grass. This guy Chris is amazing. Schwartz? Not so much. Later he takes pains to say he is not a numerologist, and then describes his obsession with the number 11 and how he sees it everywhere he looks for it. As Schwarts often says, give me a break! He claims to have been a professor at Harvard and Yale and says he is a university teacher. Surely this cannot be true; at the least, it does not reflect well on Harvard and Yale. If any university is currently paying him a salary for indoctrinating young minds with his new age speculations, someone should tell them about this book. 
 Mr. Irving has played on misinformation to form a seemingly interesting book that unfortunately continues a tradition of propaganda dating back over 50 years.  His deliberately flawed research relies on known propaganda, both from Nazis still active in the war and later Soviet sources, both with obvious reasons to twist the truth against the Allies.  And he "embellishes" details from the National Archives in Washington, twisting the facts to supply histrionic twists designed to paint Allied (especially American) forces as being the servants of Satan himself!  Irving is a discredit to authors of truth everywhere.  If you want an accurately and painstakingly researched book about the destruction of Dresden that is a fantastic read and depicts the actual truth (including the horrors) with countless interviews of survivors, read "Dresden, Tuesday, February 13, 1945" by Frederick Taylor.  Irving's book should be sent to the trash bin. 
 I really want to give this piece of garbage a Zero. Actually, I only watched part of one episode, I don't know if it's from season one. I am a Columbo fan, and a detective writer. I saw a sniper shoot a man on a platform. The platform was almost located right up against a building the sniper was in! A toilet with flowers in it. He reacts to colds? I saw a classroom full of kids. EVERY ONE had a cold! Not very realistic. Kiddie video game pacing, with no proper build up. They don't make stuff for intelligent people anymore! If you are new to this series, watch some before you buy. Maybe some of it is ok.  
 I was very disappointed with this second edition. My daughter and I loved the first action filled movie and had hoped this would be just as exciting.  The movie dragged out for the first half, and just got worse during the second half.  I continually kept looking at the clock, wondering when it would be over.  We only watched it once, and it will go in the rummage sale later this year 
 This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive, take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up, and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit.  The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good.  Sit back and enjoy/laugh 
 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 This book was a classic that was dated 30 years ago when I first read it.  If you need perspective or hisorical info from that time it is an excellent guide.   If you want a guide of info on current technology use the latest books by Shinsky or the current leading handbook (4th ed.) edited by Bela G. Liptak 
 Mr. Patterson: Please demonstrate more discretion in selecting ghost writers for your pulp fiction publishing machine.  Ms. Paetro: Don't quit your day job.  If you are looking for character development, descriptive scenes, engaging voice and style, believable conflict, romantic or who-done-it suspense, balanced point of view, entertaining pace, and (or) suspension of disbelief, this is not a book deserving of your time or money.  If your idea of pacing is 146 chapters spread across 400 pages, or if the lame pet dog character foil trick works for you, be sure to buy this book at Amazon's used book prices 
 For a biginner to intermediate triathlete looking for information, this is not the"book".  It's a glorified blank logbook.  The author even states that much of the needed information is in almanac -3 which you can purchase separatel 
  Physical labor sucks.  Okay, you know that, I know that, even Paris and Nicole (thanks to their reality show) have gotten it through their puny little brainage, but it's news to Barbara Ehrenreich, whose previous stints as Ph.D earner, activist and writer did not expose her to the grubby working world of dirty hands and aching muscles that most of us have managed to live through.   It's a shame. This could have been such a great book, but B.E.'s got a preconceived agenda (welfare reform is never gonna work!) and an axe to grind (unless we raise minimum wage to 14 bucks an hour!).  To prove her point she goes undercover for the better part of a year, taking entry-level, low-skilled work while staying in expensive short-term housing. Of course, she could of just crunched numbers -"Let's see, 7 bucks an hour times 40 hours, while my pretend rent is $200 a week...carry the zero...nope, can't afford it" - but that would have just given her a puny little 2,000 word article for Mother Jones.  Book deals, on the hand, require more work, more commitment, but think of the royalties, so off she goes, just like Paris and Nicole, to work as a waitress, maid and Wal-Mart associate.  At least until it gets too hard.  B.E.'s got a litany of complaints - my feet hurt, my back hurts, piss tests are demeaning, my boss is a jerk, customers are rude, my back huuuurts - and seems to think that only the minimum wager has to suffer such indignities.  News flash, Barbara!  Every job is stressful in its own way.  I'm a RN and it's a rare day I don't come home feeling like I've been beat with a stick.  I've been verbally abused and cussed out more times than I can remember, and that's just by the docs.  I've been pee'd on, poo'd on, run ragged, and called  "girl" by my stupidvisor (My response: I'm older than you, and I've had sex, and I'm pretty sure you haven't by the looks of you, so, boss, who's the "girl" here, and who's the WOMAN.)  I will admit I get paid significantly more for my putting-up-with-BS than the average Walmartian does for his.  But then again I earned a college degree, I had to pass a difficult competency test and I work under the constraints of my nursing license, for which I had to get fingerprinted and background checked.  So that's why I get paid more than a minimum wager, even though our jobs, probably 97% of the time, are comparable.  I'll give B.E. 2 stars for her writing.   It's smart and witty and at times, she borders on hilarious, especially when she's mocking the minorities and poor that she claims to want to help.  Hey, I didn't say she was compassionate, I said she was funny.    B.E., if you're reading this, consider this angle next time you want to write a book about not getting by.  Write a book about being poor and uninsured.  Write a book about wanting to advance your position in life, but not being able to, because as soon as you take that better paying job or go into business for yourself you'll be kicked off medicaid, and you'll run out of inhalers for your asthmatic kid, and you'll have to listen to him wheeze all night, and when you take him to the charity clinic a week from Tuesday, because that's the only time the retired charity doc can see you, you won't be able to afford the prescription since it's over a hundred bucks for one inhaler, so then you have to quit your job so you can qualify for medicaid.  Then when you're done with that, write another book, this time about the lack of decent public transportation in the majority of the U.S., and how this results in needing a car to survive, which leads to excessive personal income spent on cars, more tax money spent on roads and highways, to say nothing of the hidden costs of car accidents and obesity from driving everywhere because it's too dangerous, with all the cars on the road, to ride a bike.  Those books would be worth reading.   
 Seasons One, Two, Three:  "Go Man, Go!"  Season Four: the one to forego.  Speaking as a fan who was first stupefied (amazed; astonished) by Bob and David back when they were the Kings of Megaphone Crooning ("People didn't want to hear songs about things that hadn't even been invented yet! They wanted to hear songs about NEW things."), that is, speaking as the rare fanatic, the rare "Mister Mr. Show" raising his voice on Amazon who laughs just as hard at the good G rated sketches as he does at the good NC-17 rated sketches, I find "Season Four" the most generous sampling of limp and lifeless MS sketches available in one package.    Funnyguy Bob Odenkirk, reputedly a rather gruff fellow in real life,  says that Four was the season when "well-crafted" sketches were "in", "absurdity for absurdity's sake" was "out".  No longer, he claims, was Mr. Show a comedy show best appreciated by other comedy writers.  Translation:  they dumbed it down for the audience (and/or: horsing around in the writers' room suddenly earned you an hour in a pointy hat, facing the corner).   Enticing as the term is, "well-crafted" here seems to mean "warmed over SNL type stuff", as in: spicing up the world's 1000th Jerry Springer takeoff by setting it on a lifeboat (momentarily forgetting that incongruity usually works best when it is "funny" incongruity) and ladling on the same gay panic, the same class anxiety that makes the real Springer show such a howl.   Overall, MS4's concepts  become less novel, less thinky, less left-field-funny, with a stronger than ever reliance on the tried and true. What I mean is: a stronger than ever reliance on stoopid-guy raunch humor. But at least SGRH is a species of comedy.  I haven't nailed down a label for what fills the cracks and crannies, and accounts for at least 75% of of the ones and zeroes on these here digital donuts. Excelsior?  (ex-cel-si-or   (n.)   Slender, curved wood shavings used especially for packing (originally a trademark)).     This set did make me grin a few times -- over the course of five and a half hours.  One, and only one, sketch makes me laugh out loud: the phenomenon of "Monster Parties" (as documented in novelty songs such as "Halloween Shindig", "Dracula's Pajama Party" and the like) examined with pitch-perfect tabloid TV grammar.  Original, bent premise anchored by yet another  simultaneously vicious and sympathetic David Cross performance.  For the most part, the gang seems tired, like they're having an exhausting time at this point telling funny from not-funny.  Surely, anyone who makes a living intuiting what will make people laugh must at one time or another come to such a pass.  
 the basics seem to be omitted. There is no "quick start" chapter on how to get moving. The minutiae are well covered. The practical hands on explanations are deeply buried. The included DVD is almost completely useless and does not even play properly on my Mac G5- not a good sign for "the DVD guy 
 Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book. 1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book. 2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination. 3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books 
 I'm not a big fan of short stories as it is, but I love the era of the 40's and 50's. Seeing as how that's the era these women are from, I figured I really enjoy this. Well, I was wrong. The book focuses more on the women when their older...much older.   But that wasn't why I didn't like this book. What I didn't like was the writing style. Not AT ALL. It was extremely choppy, and I found it to be difficult to follow in many places. And the women themselves...I just didn't care for them. They were a very weird bunch, and I thought they were a bit eccentric for no apparent reason.  Overall, not a book I recommend. But as I said, I'm also not a big short story reader. I picked this up thinking I was in for some easy, light reading...but that wasn't the case. Hope you have better luck with it 
 Another book of pretty pictures from MLB, complete with a sanitized text that mistakes acheivements for moments and re-writes history to sell more t-shirts and other authorized garbage.  The recent spate of MLB books have been particularly embarrassing and this is no better.  If you buy this book you are encouraging MLB to produce more books that seek to re-write the facts of history into a marketble form and that don't respect the intelligence of the audience.  Buy a real book, written by real writers, about a real topic, rather than something sponsored by a credit card company 
 This book might be a lot more helpful if it were updated regularly. The current--third--edition is from 1986, which is ludicrous with subject matter this volatile. The content itself is a bit too brief, but would still be very helpful if it had been done some time in the last 1-5 years 
 No. No, no, no, no, no. Well, maybe. At the library, this book was in the Young Adult section. I suppose it should be moved to the children's section, because as I read it, I felt like a child learning to read. The style was rather bland, and much like the stories I used to write when I was in the fifth grade. The style was the first thing to turn me away, as well as several cop-outs in the writing.   Cop-outs how? Well, it wasn't very realistic. At all. While yes, most teens are overly dramatic, their parents and teachers aren't. It didn't seem realistic that a parent would leave once a child came out of the closet, rather than kicking him out. It didn't seem realistic that the parents ALL became so easily adjusted to it. It WAS realistic that some of the teens were so naive, but it didn't help at all. Things went exactly as the characters wanted them to, and it wasn't that interesting. It was rather obvious how everything was going to happen; when one character said they wanted something to happen at a certain place and time, it happened. There were hardly any obstacles, and the background characters were all really, really fake.  The plot to me, seemed a bit dry as well. Overall, the book didn't impress me. Yes, it may be aimed towards younger people, but hey, I AM a younger person. I wasn't impressed, however. Others may have been, but it just wasn't happening for me.  Hey, the guys on the cover are sorta cute. Sorta 
 Try saving your money and buying ordinary half and half, mix it with some whole milk and pour in a tiny bit of sugar. MMMMMMMmmmmm. How do you know all these reviews weren't planted 
 Aweful. That's the word that best describes the movie. While I love the actor, he can't save the day even if were the real SuperMan. I think what destroys the movie more than the bad script (which us dragon lovers are used to), is the repeated dragon clip they use for most of the dragon shots. 1 shot moving down a hallway.. same shot, reversed. Oh wait lets do it again, and again and again. That's the entire visual effect of the Dragon. 1 clip being reversed like a pancake. Same shot mind you, going left then going right. That's it. That's the big Dragon effect. OMG, just shoot me! I even love B movies but this one was just aweful. I mean, even a bad script can survive if the cgi was halfway decent to make it a B movie but this one is definately F for Flush it 
 This is just a piece of ***  Hollywood has shown here that they just have no new ideas/stories so they continue to try and use special effects and a bad scriptwriters to remake what was and still is one of the best movies ever.  This is not the first Hollywood remake that is garbage and will not be the last but as long as there are people willing to part with good money to watch movies it won't change.   This is a good reason why Blockbuster have lost sales recently - nothing worth watchin 
 First in a series, BENEATH A BLOOD RED MOON by Shannon Drake is a paranormal romance that's a cross between vampire melodrama and a police murder-mystery.  Spanning 200 years, it follows the lives of the mysterious Montgomery heiresses, rumored to be vampires, contrasted with the modern-day love affair between a cop named Sean and the latest Montgomery heiress, Maggie.  Sean is also the lead cop on a series of gruesome murders committed by a serial killer imitating Jack the Ripper - and who somehow is connected to Maggie.  I didn't particularly care for the story ... and my list of complaints is long.  The book is actually a quick read and keeps your attention, but I felt it was too melodramatic (and cheesy), especially the prologue.  I also didn't like the author's writing style; she wasted a lot of time on unnecessary "fluff" details and dialogue, none of which pertained to the plot or romance.  The plot line itself was interesting, but I was rolling my eyes way too often to enjoy it and had figured out the major secrets long before they were finally revealed.  The happily-ever-after ending was also wrapped up too nicely, with no explanation as to how "the miracle" happened.  All in all, it was an unsatisfying reading experience.  FYI: Erotica writer Angela Knight's THE FOREVER KISS or JANE'S WARLORD both handle these themes much better, the former being about vampires, the latter having a time-traveling Jack the Ripper. 
 I didn't like the book because it has no action.Paul Fliechman, the only action you had was when sae young got beat up and thats what I thought about SEED FOLKS.        
 What a load of tripe. shes trying to hang on her sisters coat tails.  go back to acting joan cos you certainly can't write.  that's for sure 
 Get ready for lots of product plugs for Mr Spillane's favorite brand of beer, and ease back into your chair for hours of sheer boredom.  Too many characters and no compelling story are the deathknells of this dreadful book.  I liked Mako's tough guy image, and I liked his Caribbean sidekick, who keeps calling him "sar", but I didn't like the rambling nature of the book.  Now, onto a book I can enjoy.. 
 I like my blues to be blue.  I want hard times, heartache.   I'm surprised how often Muddy sings happy songs - one's titled "So Glad I'm Living", another one "I Feel So Good."   And then there are all the sexual braggadocio songs, like "My Love Strikes Like Lightning."   But my favorite songs are the dark ones - songs like "Still a Fool," or "You Shook Me,"  a letter to a fantastic lover who's ruining his marriage and lover - and "Black Night, which, fitting its title, is just all around dark.   Muddy Waters had a great band behind him/with him - I read on Wikipedia that they were known as the Headhunters, because they would go to a club where someone else was playing, ask to sit in, then "cut the heads off" the locals with their musicianship.  You hear a tight band, a group of guys that knows how to play together, on songs like "I Feel So Good" and "Bird Nest on the Ground."   But the musician who really stands out is Little Walter, on the harmonica.  That guy can howl, and make you feel it.  He's especially hot on "Sugar Sweet."  
 This book is certainly a challenging read that contains many complex and intricate episodes. I disagree with those readers who wrote that the switching between the stories makes it difficult to follow - that is the narrative structure of the novel, and readers should be prepared for this before they start. I thought that the Sanjay/Sikander story would have made a strong, exciting and appealing novel on it's own, without Abhay's story interwoven. I enjoyed almost every aspect of Sanjay's story, especially the mystical elements. Abhay's story in contrast,was cliched and predicatable. He is, as another reader wrote, "fashionably alientated", which I think perfectly describes him, as are his strange friends. This disillusionment, moral laxity, narcotics indulgence and general feeling of ennui is so overdone it makes the reader as bored as the characters. Some plotlines were downright repellant - the porn star story (thanks, didn't need to know!) and the Victorian boarding school sodomy (cliched and very disgusting). These stories, and Abhay's whole story, lowered the enjoyment of the book very greatly. But the most important point: this book is for male readers. There are two categories of female characters: sexual object or maternal. Chandra's women are completely two-dimensionalised by the male lense through which they are seen. They are addendums to the male world this book explores. Janvi comes closest to anything real, but she too is flattened by the perspective we see her from i.e. her adoring male admirers. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this book to any women, and I would caution those who want to read it to expect unnecessary moments that are pretty disgusting, and a repellent depiction of the modern world 
 Yes, I know I sound cruel, but I just received his book, and of the 104 pages, there are  57 pages of some pretty sad looking infrared photos.  No, I have not begun to read the book, but how could I follow his instructions when I can see that I simply don't like his infrared photos.  AND, the reason I purchased his book was all the GREAT reviews it received. Listen, maybe I'm wrong about his photos. I'm no photographer, so what do I know?....  And, yes, I'm real sorry I bought his book.. 
 Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.  While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging.. 
 Your description of the Popover Pan did not did not contain "MINI".  The item I wanted was the standard size popover pan, not the mini.  "MINI" should be added to your description 
 "The Future of War" predicts US dominance of warfare throughout the 21st Century, as a result of US advanced technology in general and precision weaponry in particular. Their train of thought has considerable merit, and deserves reading and thoughtful attention. However, the book suffers from the same two major flaws as most books by visionaries without enough practical experience: misunderstanding of specific happenings in the past, and unlikely projections into the far future. Having been involved with US defense for 50 years, as a member of the military, as a designer and developer and advisor on US weaponry, and as an advisor on strategic, operational and tactical issues, I read this book with considerable amusement, although I do take seriously much of what it says. I shall give specifics on two failures to understand the details of the past, and then offer criticism of two of the book's projections, as examples.  Past episode #1: The 1991 precision strikes against Iraq. There is no doubt that our air strikes and land attacks in the 1991 campaign to liberate Kuwait were exceedingly effective, and there is no doubt that this effectiveness was largely due to our precision weaponry. However, to do precision strikes, whether with airborne munitions or ground forces, it's necessary to know what targets to attack, where they are, and what weapons are likely to be effective against a particular target. In the 1991 campaign, this effort was undertaken by the "Jeddi Knights", largely under the guidance of Col. John Warden. The key role of the "Jeddi Knights" was to establish priorities and mission profiles for which targets to strike when with what munitions, and they did this extraordinarily well. What the Friedmans obviously don't know is the amount of detailed information that was available to the "Jeddi Knights", carefully acquired over the 70 years preceding the campaign, first by the British until about 1950, and thereafter by the US military. The armed forces of major powers assume they may have to fight wars on short notice aganst opponents who have been designated shortly before by national authorities, so they invest a great deal in gathering information pertinent to how various campaigns might be conducted. In the case of Iraq, the British did very careful mapping from 1920 until about 1950, producing "ordnance" maps of higher detail and accuracy than exist even for some parts of the United States, and these were invaluable to planners. Then, starting in about 1950, when it began to seem possible that the US might someday have to fight somewhere in the Middle East, the US military carefully gathered information relevant to how a campaign might be fought, and which potential enemy targets should be candidates for destruction. These studies resided in US intelligence and military archives until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and were then used as the basis for planning the campaign.  Two examples of this. First, the destruction of certain bridges was given high priority not to impede vehicular movement, but to sever the communications cables running under the bridges; our planners knew which cables important to Iraqi Command and Control were buried too deeply to destroy easily except where they were routed under bridges, and therefore which bridges to take out to disrupt Iraqi military communications. Second, the swing by US, British and French forces far to the West, the "Hail Mary" gambit, would not have been possible in that harsh terrain unless viable routes for armor and supply vehicles were known, and the Iraqi Army either didn't know of such routes or didn't believe we could know of them. There are exactly two feasible routes, and both were used; they can both be determined in complete detail from careful study of the British Ordnance maps prepared in the 1930s, and (although I wasn't involved in the campaign planning) I had no difficulty in finding and plotting the only two feasible routes before the ground campaign began, from the good maps in my possession. I also understand why it was necessary to bring the two prototype JSTARS systems to the theatre, to detect and allow blocking of any Iraqi strike intended to sever the Tapline Road; this was also evident from the maps.  By contrast, we had no success at all in locating and destroying mobile Scud missile launchers, because they moved around with great frequency. If you don't know where something is, no precision of your weaponry, and no amount of technical sophistication or military skill, will allow you to destroy it.  Past example #2: The SAFEGUARD BMD system. The Friedmans say, on the basis of assertions by people who may or may not be experts, that SAFEGUARD was deactivated because it wouldn't work. In fact the situation was exactly the reverse, but one must know the purpose of SAFEGUARD and its mode of operation to understand what actually happened. The mission of SAFEGUARD was to prevent complete success of a Soviet counterforce first strike against our Minuteman ICBM fields, by opening a "launch window" for a retaliatory strike by the Minuteman missiles in the face of a full-scale Soviet strike. I helped to plan and design that system, and it would have done what it was intended to, although at a horrible increased toll of death and destruction, which I dreaded, but could see no alternative to in the face of rapidly increasing Soviet capability. Far more important than the fact that we knew SAFEGUARD would work was the fact that the Soviets concluded it would work; that realization brought them back to the bargainng table at the Helsinki talks, and led to the SALT I treaty, which I rejoiced about. Provisions of that treaty made SAFEGUARD unnecessary, and that's why the one completed SAFEGUARD site was deactivated and construction on the other sites was stopped.  Also on the subject of balistic missile defense, the Friedmans assert that midcourse discrimination and destruction of incoming warheads is infeasible. This is simply not true, although there is an exceedingly serious problem associated with doing it. I know three quite different ways of doing midcourse discrimintion and destruction of enemy incoming warheads, and, given that I've been out of that business for more than 10 years, I expect that other ways are known by now. The problem is that, at least for the three ways I know, one is politically unacceptable to the US Congress and the US public, one is so expensive that it's unlikely Congress would ever fund it, and the third, if fully developed, would be usable for certain other military purposes that would probably lead to a renewed arms race as our potential major opponents sought to counter it. (I was one of a small group of scientists who successfully recommended to Congress that development of that third approach be stopped, to avoid the resulting foreseeable escalation; scientists and military professionals, despite various comments in the Friedmans' book, work closely together over years and decades, and come to have considerable knowledge of each other's fields.) Whether at some future time it may become desirable to develop and deploy a BMD system that does midcourse discrimination and destruction of warheads is a political and diplomatic question to be decided by the public and its elected leaders, on which I have no insight, but it is technically feasible.  Now, turning to the future, what the Friedmans fail to understand in their glowing vision of US technology dominating future warfare, is that for every technical advance, opponents can devise at least partial countermeasures, and that therefore no amount of technology as such can determine the outcome of a campaign. The Coalition conquest of Iraq in 2003 provides an excellent example. Although large parts of the Iraqi army, and all of its top leadership, was utterly incompetent, other large parts of the Iraqi army were composed of thoroughly trained officers and enlisted men, who fully understood that if they confronted US forces nose to nose, they would be destroyed. Understanding this, very many of the best Iraqi units simply demobilized themsleves and disappeared into the civilian population as Coalition forces approached, in many cases taking their weaponry with them. One entire Iraqi division near the border with Iran totally vanished before we got to its bases; everyone from the division commander to the most junior private. Professional soldiers, even if motivated to fight, have no more desire than anyone else to be killed pointlessly in a situation where they are unable to resist effectively.  A substantial fraction of these well-trained, motivated Iraqi forces subsequently emerged as part of the resistance movement that continues in Iraq. How many of the resistance fighters come from that crowd is obviously impossible to know for sure, but my personal estimate is that about 30,000 of Saddam Hussein's best and most loyal troops and officers became part of the resistance movement. And our overwhelming superiority in all aspects of conventional warfare have been far less effective against current Iraqi resistance methods; the resistance movement seems to be gradually weakening and fragmenting, but it's a long slow process, in which our precision weapons and our advanced communications and intelligence give us far less of an advantage than they do in conventional warfare.  There are various other gaps in the Friedmans' assessment of the future. I'll mention only two of many. First, vircators, often touted as the most effective weapon of the 21st Century, have had only relatively diappointing results so far. Why? Partly because technical improvements to vircators are needed; those will surely come along in due course. Much more serious is the fact that battle damage asssessment after a vircator strike is at present almost impossible to do with any degree of accuracy, so after a target has been attacked with one or more vircators, there is no practical way to know whether the strike was successful or not. Presumably some day we will overcome this particular problem, but it illustrates that new and potentially formidable technology may find relatively little application because of purely tactical and operational problems that arise in using it.  As my second example, I'll remark on the Friedmans' vision of US infantrymen as being in effect "cocooned" in future to protect them from the enemy's weapons. This vision ignores two serious problems. First, no "cocoon" imaginable can protect an infantryman against certain weapons such as a fuel-air bomb if the enemy knows approximately where the infantryman is. Second, and closely related, anyone with substantial experience in concealing himself in a hostile environment, including me, knows all too well that the more accoutrements one has, the harder it is to hide and not be observed. In light clothing and carrying only light personal weapons, I can disappear into the landscape almost anywhere, and move around unnoticed; burdened with excess equipment and elaborate protective clothing, only certain carefully selected spots can offer concealment. Everyone with experience in this matter knows as much as I do on this subject, so infantrymen whose lives depend on not being observed will move far more cautiously when heavily burdened than when lightly armed and lightly protected. That doesn't mean infantry should be sent into combat inadequately equipped, but it does mean that the increased effectiveness of some given number of trained infantry when provided with extra combat capability and protective equipment is far less than one might otherwise suppose.  I could cite dozens of other matters, past and projected, which the Friedmans book misunderstands or overlook, but this is enough. I'll just say that the book is an excellent source of ideas, but should be viewed with practiced skepticism 
 Have not heard from my youngest son if the book was helpful.  Older son had it and found it useful even though both my sons are strong Christians and confident in their faith and their expression of it. I know it is useful to all students who have not had previous experience with other world views and attacks on their faith. 
 A good travelogue of the region. But only a few short minutes of the CANAL itself. Title is very misleading. Spends precious little time on the building of the canal, the experience of transversing it, et al. Focuses on the geography and culture of the cities in the area and the culture, etc. But very dispappointing regarding the CANAL itself 
 I hate to say this about a Christian apologist like Paul Copan, who has put out some very good apologetic material, but this book was horrendous.  I mean it was absolutely terrible.  I can't even begin to describe how many poor conclusions were reached and how many poor answers were given to problems raised with Christianity.  He had EXTREMELY simplistic and EXAGGERATED explanations of what other faiths held (especially Eastern Pantheism, which he completely misrepresented).  On pages 98-99 Copan discusses the problem of natural disasters.  Copan’s explanations in the previous parts of this chapter seem to deal only with moral evils which result from human choices, so here he attempts to address the issue of evil which seems not to stem from human choices.  He argues that natural disasters are actually necessary to keep life on this planet alive (98).  For example, earthquakes are needed to recycle essential nutrients back into the continents (98).  I personally do not find his argument very convincing.  I think that any Christian would need to tie natural evils into the Fall as Schaffer does in Genesis in Space and Time, where he presents natural evils as stemming from a rift which developed between man and nature as a result of sin.   If we do not do this, it does not make much sense for God to curse the ground as a result of Adam’s sin, for it would already have been cursed if nothing in nature changed as a result of the Fall.  Further, as a philosophical objection, surely God could have created a world where natural disasters were not necessary to sustain the earth.  Copan responds to this by saying that we cannot know that a world with this condition is possible (98-99), but does he really believe that there will be natural disasters on the new earth?  I sincerely hope that he has better expectations than that.  Copan also claims that all three members of the Trinity got together before Jesus became incarnate and decided what Jesus self-limitations should be (135).  He makes it sound like God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit had this little business meeting and voted on what Jesus should have to give up in becoming human.  I cannot imagine what Copan could possibly use to support this view, as we hardly have access to the logs from the Trinity’s meetings, nor do I see why this was a necessary point to be thrown in with the rest.    Copan had some absolutely horrible theological implications spread all over the book.  For example, he had a chapter discussing how it could be that Jesus was tempted, since the Bible says that God cannot be tempted. Copan’s idea that Jesus mistakenly thought that he could sin when he in reality could not is not a view that seems particularly attractive to me.  Copan seems to be stretching things a bit too far when he claims that Jesus simply thought that he could sin, therefore the temptation was real to him (141).  Copan decided beforehand that Jesus could not sin because God cannot sin (though he fails to address the problem which he opens the chapter with in saying “if God cannot sin, then it seems he is not really free or all-powerful” [138]), and is forced to reduce himself to pulling some strange stunts to make his ends meet.  Unfortunately for Copan, I do not think that concluding that Jesus must have been mistaken in his beliefs is an adequate way of making his ends meet.  If Jesus was mistaken about his ability to sin, why should he not be mistaken about other things as well?  Copan’s solution seems to simply open up an even larger can of worms than the one he is attempting to close with his answer.  Some of his answers to problems raised with Christianity are simply rediculous.  For example, in the chapter discussing the Cananite genoicide, Copan says that the Israelite soldiers did not go around raping and brutalizing the Canaanites, as the Crusaders did to the Muslims (165-166).  They were not fighting (in theory) out of love for bloodshed, but in obedience to God, and they fought under God’s morality even in battle (165-166).  While this is helpful information, I am not sure that it really alleviates the problem addressed in this chapter:  “how could a loving God command genocide?”  I am not sure that a skeptic interested in the Christian faith would be comforted if we told him “well, God may have commanded genocide and killed every man, woman, and child of Canaanite blood, but He had the Israelites do it kindly and they weren’t even cruel to the Canaanites when they killed them.”  It just seems to me the objection raised is that God commanded genocide, not that God had them killed cruelly.  The killing of the Canaanites is the main issue, not how they died.  I could go on and on.  It was simply a poor book, and if one accepted all the answers and explanations that he gave, one would end up as a open theist who believes in contradictory ideas and is ill prepared to actually give an answer for his faith when challenged by a skeptic.  I cannot imagine many skeptics stupid enough to accept most of the answers that Copan gives in this book.  There are good answers to the questions he addresses, he just does not give them.  Overall grade: D 
 3 stars for its entertaining value, 2 stars for its real worth.  The author seems to lack some understanding of macroeconomics, as mentioned in other reviews 
 If you have read these in the paper you are no doubt aware that Family Circus is trite and vapid. But if you think that this book somehow contains the jems that you somehow missed, please don't be fooled. I picked this up at a friends house after asking myself "why would sombody buy this?". The answer is This is the most undesirable gift to ever grace a white elephant gift exchange. If you want to see everybody scramble to get rid of a gift, just throw this waste of paper in the mix, but please don't buy it yourself 
 My thoughts on the book have evolved over time.  When it first came out, I could take  it as a serious critique of past policies of the state department.  But that was before Robert Kaplan published a Fascist policial book titled "Warrior politics: why leadership demands a Pagan Ethos".  Mr. Kaplan is an unapoligetic Fascist who has openly rejected both Jewish and  Christian morality in favor of the politics of terror and force.  And his decision to go down the road of Fascism casts a different light on the contents of this book.   This book draws broad conclusions about the state department and a whole set of people who served over the course of decades based on Kaplan hand-selecting a few individuals to prove the points he wanted to make.  Its also a profoundly anti-intellectual work that somehow asserts that knowledge and contacts within local cultures inevitably leads to collaboration with the "enemy".  After reading warrior politics, its rather clear that Kaplan's views of dealing with other countries were not what he tried make them in this book.  In "warrior politics", he comes out an unapoligistic imperialist who sees those outside the borders of the USA and Israel as barbarians who can only be dealt with by brutal force.  A level of force such that he feels it necessary to open advocate the abandonment of Jewish and Christian notions of  morality.  What Kaplan never understood about the state department he hated so much was that having all those voices who understood countries, cultures and languages allowed for better policy decisions often to be made.  The new state department is full of people top to bottom who don't understand the world outside the united states, often don't have language skills and who regard in-country postings as a joke.  Everything is centralized in washington now and policy decisons are more likely to be driven by someone from a political think  tank who knows nothing about the politics or culture of the countries they are making decisions about.  This didn't make sense before.  But now it does.  Kaplan is an amoral fascist who sees peace as a dangerous fantasy and pure force as the only basis for dealing with any "barbarian"  countries.  His love for the ideal of the roman empire and disregard for human life also explains why no amount of failure in reconstructing Iraq would mean anything to him.  The american soldiers who die in Iraq in Kaplan's world view have no particular value or meaning. Kaplan, as the Roman Empire or Napoleon, simply sees soldiers as something to be used up in order to gain an advantage.  To regard human life as having any meaning would, in his stated world-view, be false autruism 
 Katzenbach is a good writer. His "The Analyst" is one of the best thrillers I've read. And Hart's war and The Madmans Tale are well written gripping stories. However with State of Mind I found my own mind wandering as I read it. Somehow it is too long and not particularly compelling. The future America he devises where everyone is armed and guards escort office workers to their cars is not perhaps far fetched but felt superficial. It merely existed as a counterpoint for a new 51st State where everyone was safe.  Don't bother with this book, especially when Katzenbach has written so much better 
 What a disappointment. After reading the great reviews on Amazon, I was very much looking forward to this book.   After reading one chapter though, I went to the Internet to do a little research -- I was sure this book must be self-published, as it reads more like a term paper than like a professionally edited book about autism and ADHD. In fact, what I found is that publisher WaterBrook Press is "an autonomous evangelical religious publishing division of Random House." OK, that would explain the bible quotes. I would've preferred to know that before I bought this book. But to be fair, the religious overtones are fairly innocuous. No, my real problem is that I don't believe the publisher/editor has any deep understanding of the subject, and therefore didn't hold this book to the same standards that Future Horizons or JKP would have.  I DO believe that the connection between ADD/ADHD and Autism/Asperger needs to be delved into. Unfortunately, this book doesn't do a very good job of it. While the author points out the many things that ADHD and autism/Asperger Syndrome have in common, she virtually ignores their differences (e.g. an aspie's intense resistence to change, or their preoccupation with specific subjects -- very defining elements of the disorder). If this was the only book you read about autism and asperger, you'd come out with a very poor understanding of those diagnoses 
 I bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars.  I have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit.  The set I received did not have the extention straps included.  The harness was the same as all the other harnesses I could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back.  If you are buying these because of the extention straps, you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars.  They were well made, just not the same item as shown in the picture 
 I'm not a native english speaker. But I used to live in US for a while. And also Andre Lamothe's books make big senses to me.  With this background, I conclude that the author of this book doesn't know how to explain something. For example, while explaining quadtree, he doesn't talk anything about setting up quadtree for a terrain data. Instead, suddenly he talks about moving objects around quadtree. Even worse, that moving objects around quadtree doesn't make any sense either. Even worse, he says "oh my terrain engine works". I really don't know what he wants to show us.  It's almost like "focus on terrain ..." book written by a high school kid.  I'd rather dig internet for terrain handling algorithms than buy those two books 
 This metal detector is nice, notwithstanding, it performs poorly when in all metal mode.  Initially all metal mode works fine, however, after half an hour of use the batteries begin to wear out and the battery low indicator does not come on.  When all metal mode is used after half an hour of the detector's use, it just squeals uncontrollably.  It's supposed to go off over metal and pin point the source of your initial find with great accuracy.  Again, after thirty minutes of use of the detector, it will no longer go off over the source, it will just go off constantly, no mater where you hold it.  I could hold it into the air and it still squeals.  I made every adjustment I could and it just continues to make noise.  This mode is worthless unless your using it with two fresh 9 volt batteries every half an hour.  Finally, if you're hunting say meteorites for four hours, you can expect to spend over $56.00 on batteries for that afternoon 
 This is a very dissapointing DVD. If they allowed you to have songs without commentary interruption it might be ok, or if there was any 'previously unreleased' music on it. Even if they just had the pictures, film and diary entries with the music it would be ok. But there's no reason to watch this DVD more than once if you have to listen to all the commentary each time. The Band of Gypsy DVD has two options, Concert Footage only and Concert Footage with Commentary. Jimi's music speaks for itself, and no one can come close to him, so it's not necessary to hear what people have to say about him. The music and maybe the pictures as background are enough 
 Beside simply being dated, the few pages in this book that "debunk" the thesis that drugs were used in ancient cults, particularly Eleusis, is so full of errors, scholarly and otherwise, that one has to wonder about the hidden motives for doing so.  If you want the truth about Eleusis, try "The Road to Eleusis. 
 Didn't snow yet so I don't know hw it would work for snow shovelling but for sweeping dirts from my deck and driveway, it's totaly useless. Now I have to buy a traditional broom to do that job. Generally speaking, this is a bulky, hard to install hard to maneuver tool that do much less job than expected.  Highly not recommended 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 I think Hemingway wanted to do two things:  (1) critique certain aspects of how WWII was fought (particularly the politicalization of battle plans); and (2) pay homage to his beloved Venice.  To do so, he crafted a fairly thin story about an old soldier who finds himself in one last love with a girl a fraction of his age.  The plot (to the extent there is one) and the relationship between the characters would probably make a nice short story.  The bulk of the book is taken up by tourist writing about Venice (locales, architecture, food, markets, layout, and, of course, the canals) and a journalist's rants about US generals in WWII.  Diehard Hemingway fans will find some jewels worth the read; others should stay away 
 I had high hopes for this book, with the description on the inside dustjacket mentioning George RR Martin's A Song of Ice & Fire... NOT. It started well enough I guess, but man o man, did it get convoluted, hard to follow, and boring QUICK. The plot seemed to concern a place called Sunnashiven and how a bunch of angry peasants rise up in revolt under the command of some lordly person who is actually acting under orders from some even more powerful lordly person... To tell ya the truth, I don't even really know - it was such complicated dry boring reading that I didn't have the patience to try to comprehend it all. I got almost halfway thru it before I decided to return it. I liked the idea of an EVIL cleric as the hero... but it was so terribly boring and hard to understand that I didn't even get to the part where he decides to turn evil - and the totally lame name of Llewelyn didn't help. I commend Karen Michaelson for her attempt, but I can only say that she needs to try again - though I will not be along for the ride on the next one. This confirms that women who can write good fantasy are few and far between... Margaret Weis I enjoyed when I was younger, and Robin Hobb more recently. That's it. If you want to read some really good fantasy, read George RR Martin and Guy Gavriel Kay 
 I was again disappointed as this did not make me feel "fresh".  In fact if you mix it with the Dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it.  
   This book was loaned to me by a customer of my shop . I read a little over a third of it before having had enough . That there are people in America who assign any validity to this trash is the scariest of prospects for the future of world peace .     Fear mongering and propagation of hatred are all I got from what little I read of this . Facts ( a very lberal use of that term ) are distorted or ignored in order to bolster the author's thesis . This is proof that the world is full of stupid people .     
 The film opens with three men arriving at a house. They draw their pistols and rush in. Shots are fired, and Tuco escapes. Then a bounty hunter visits an isolated house, searching for "Jackson". He learns the new name of "Bill Carson" (they were part of a gang of robbers). There is an exchange of opinions, shots are fired. The bounty hunter leaves to report to his boss, and perform another job. Next we see a wanted man captured by three men. Another man shows up to eliminate the competition, like a lion driving away hyenas. The wanted man is turned in for the reward. But his hanging is prevented, and he rides away to be recycled. [Can you believe this?]  Tuco catches up to his former partner and captures him, the tables are turned. [This is like a cartoon.] Just like it looks like it is over for "Blondie" a runaway wagon appears to begin a new story! A dying man tells of a buried treasure of stolen payroll. Now Tuco must care for "Blondie" because he knows the name on the grave that contains the treasure. As they ride away, they see a gray troop of cavalry coming for them. The gray turns out to be dust on their blue uniforms. [Another joke.] Now they are prisoners and sent to a camp. [Was there really combat in the southwest?] This film is like a succession of short stories linked through the same characters.  Tuco manages to escape from the train. Later "Blondie" escapes and they meet again. There is more gunplay in eliminating the competition for their business deal. They arrive at a huge cemetery, much too large for the small town shown in this film. [Obviously staged.] And so there is a showdown between the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Scratch one rival. The film ends with a sick joke about hanging. I wonder why some people rate this film highly?  The vocalized song means there is no problem in translation to another language. [Isn't it funny?] The most interesting part is how a 1950s style Western was created by Europeans after they became obsolete in Hollywood. Not that they can't do better. 
 Sounds like the background music used in the 70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean, too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so, it's where the money is.  No improvisatory feel either. This is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as will true jazzers.  I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened, even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's real jazz, or real funk. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, pleasant background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion. It just sounds like they are holding back...I know they can play more advanced, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever since the 60's 
 Do not read this book. I attempted to read this book for a college class. This book should be cut down to the size of a magazine article and be published in a scientific journal. The public should not be misled into thinking that this book is readable. It is written at too high of a diction, and Griffin rambles on for 20 pages on one topic, which I won't spoil for those of you unfortunate to read this trash. The subject information is interesting, but this is written poorly, and will bore the reader to tears. Just thought I'd let you all know 
 Hated it. Read 45 pages. Aimed to read 75 before throwing in the towel, but couldn't make it that far. Not funny. Not clever. Not even especially entertaining. 
 I consider my completition of Herlitzer's COMEDY WRITING SECRETS to be one of my greatest accomplishments this year, as I can remember fewer more arduous uphill battles. The first problem with this book is how old it is. Published in 1987, he refers to rising stars of comedy like Robin Williams and Billy Crystal. Since comedy is like any other fast-paced media, these guys are practically the wise old men at this point.   With the way he breaks down humor in here, into such contrived formulas and over-simplification, it seems he could never have imagined the popularity of stand-ups like Dave Atell, Mike Barbiglio, Lewis Black, Jon Stewart or the atrocious Colin Quinn. Humor has simply changed too much since he wrote this book.  And while this book may contain little gems here and there, he consistently uses the most TERRIBLE jokes for his examples (like: "wife to husband, opening present, 'It's what I always wanted! Did you keep the receipt?'").   I hate to disagree with every other reviewer, but I think that this book's advice on comedy only applies to the select few of us blessed with time machines 
 This is not a book for the novice to learn basic self defense techniques. There are only two pictures on self defense. The rest is written. You have to already know the techniques to know what he is talking about, in which case you don't need this book. It is mostly a book about Applegate's days in the O.S.S. and how they trained. What I really don't like is the way it was falsly advertised as a book to learn the few basic techniques needed for self defense, when this is not the case at all. It is way over priced for the content 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 The plot and pacing of this movie are terrible... Patton is great in one role, horrible in another... it is indeed painful to watch all of it.  The movie cannot be compared to Lynch.  Karen black is good in her roles.  And I agree, the visuals are interesting, it is already a cult classic. 
 This book is poorly written and not worth the money.  Too much time spent on vague ideals and notions of death and dying not enough substance.  Dr. Bolen spends very little time sharing the actual patient's stories and too much time on the New Age doctrine she so voraciously clings to.  A New Age sermon is what this book is, not a search for meaning during life-threatening illness 
 This is one of the most confusing and dis-organized books that I have ever read.  Unfortunately, since it's required reading for some classes, I feel sorry for anyone that has to suffer the wrath of C programming morons such as the author of this book.  I highly recommend suicide before suffering through this book as a reference.  I would recommend that you search elsewhere to learn about data structures in C 
 Being a fledgling opponent of strong AI, I picked up this book hoping to learn the weaknesses of the strong AI argument. Alas, this was the wrong book to pick up.  I am not even sure what Penrose's main argument is; of course it may be there but was lost in the 450 pages of mostly irrelevant details on physics. To say in the least, his attack is not coherent or well structured. He seems to admit that his position is very vulnerable himself: he constantly admits to mere speculation and weakness of evidence on his part.   If he abridged this book to may 100 or 200 pages, it may have been more effective. When I was half way through, I nearly quit reading because I could tell he was going nowhere, but I figured if I had already wasted this much time, I might was well finish it. I regret that decision now.   TENM may be just another example of a grandiose physicist touting an interesting subject like modern physics as accessible to the layman. If it is accessible, Penrose is not the one to do it. There seems to be a market for these pop physics books (i.e. Elegant Universe) because yuppies out there want a feeling of wonderment about things they don't understand. How much they actually get from these  books questionable.   In the end, Penrose somehow wants to say that modern physics presents an obstacle for strong AI. I hope there are books out there that actually might show this 
 I'm puzzled as to why anyone should pay $59.39 for these three DVDs that currently retail on Amazon for $11.24 (Signs), $14.99 (Unbreakable), and $26.99 (Sixth Sense*) totaling $53.22?    *There is also a less expenseive "Collector's Version" of the Sixth Sense that only costs $14.99 if you'd rather not pay the $12.00 for the "Vista Series" extras.  I'm also skeptical as to whether the version of Unbreakable sold here has as much content as the Vista series edition sold seperately that contains 2 discs (I assume this edition does not because this box set only includes 3 discs, 1 per movie).    I love the movies, but where's the price break on buying them all together when the package is $6.17-$18.17 more than purchasing these DVD's seperately???  
 A pretty good movie, it was definetly better than I expected it to be, good enough for me to submit a review about it 
 Spong refuses to realize that God doesn't change, Scripture doesn't change, and therefore the Church shouldn't change.  To call the Church "anachronistic" for its attitudes on sexuality is to punt away the truth.  Granted, there have been abuses fo power by the church in many instances in areas such as these, and these are to be addressed and fixed, but to completely reevaluate, as Spong endorses, the Church's approach to how it stands in the face of modernity is to bow down to modernity as to an idol.  I hope and pray that Spong comes to a saving knowlege of Jesus Christ someday, and abandons the liberal nonsense that he worships in the place of the God he claims to serve 
 I found this book to be easy to read, but severely outdated.  The author also took a very alarmist stance that treated pregnancy as an illness.  I would have preferred a more balanced view like what I found in Pregnancy for Dummies, which is a very good introductory book.  I would NOT recommend this book 
 Ajalt has done a very good job with the book, but the audio series is worse than bad.  The native speakers on the tape speak too quickly, there's no English to reinforce the Japanese, and it's just too frustrating to learn from 
 this lady talks about her wedding and how it was sooo inexpensive. umm..yeah b/c SHE INVITED 50 PEOPLE. hello?!?! anyone could throw a wedding for cheap if they invited 50 ppl. she still spent a lot of money per person on their food. whats the point?!?! i can't afford to spend $20 a plate for the my wedding like she did.  i, (unfotunatley) and goign to have a larger wedding. nothing in here was insightful to me. having a friend taking the pictures or baking the cake..are you serious. i would not dream of having a friend to bake a cake for 400+ plus ppl (even if they offered.) that would literally be suicide. plus i my maid of honor is into photography and she said to never have someone who doens't have wedding photography experiance b/c apparently is harder than you think.   if you are lucky enough to have a friend or family member who can provide thier services for you that would be nice..but you don't need a book to tell you that. those friends and family members will volunteer their services. i would think it to be rude to ask them for their help straight up.   overall, you could change the title to "how to save $ by mooching off your freinds and family." b.c that is pretty much all she suggests. do yourself a favor and buy "bridal bargains" from denise and alan fields. well worth the money. 
 Purchased Fix-It Utilities 6 a few weeks back and installed it on my desk top running Windows XP.  Immediately after installation I ran the program and repaired only the minimum errors as recommended.  However, many programs on my computer would not run and could not access many files.  Called VCOM for help ,but  their solution did not work.  I was even unable to get system restore to correct the problem. I had to re-format my hard drive and re-install all my programs and files.  I cannot recommend this registry repair 
 Author Gary Wills proposes a thesis that there is no one best leader and that those great leaders have been so as a function of personal characteristics meeting the circumstances of the times.  This is a worthy and admirable approach on the surface but the author fails to adequately cite what elements or factors were key to this leadership.  Rather he settles for recounting history. This recounting is complicated with the author's political biases tending to overshadow the points the author intends to make.  There are many more effectively communicated and thoughtful books available on the subject that are devoid of left-leaning political bias.  This book is not worth the money spent on it and fortunately my book retailer took mine back for a credit 
 As a true beginner, I had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts in the book. It did not give nearly as many examples as were necessary nor was the presentation beginner friendly. I wouldn't recommend this book... unfortunately, I don't know of a good alternative 
 Bishop Spong is very interesting, instead of attacking conservatives he attacks Christ Himself.  The sad thing is for all the good points he has unless you reimagine faith (or lack of faith) like him, you can easily discount his ideas and some of the true things he says.  He is an important figure, not because of his scholarship which is laughable... he is important because he does prompt discussion and challenges the complacent. 
 At first you think that this book is going to give you insight into the stardard language as spoken in Britain, Australia, and so on. There is a lot on diversity but we never quite get to the practical side of things and it is all left a bit unclear. What I needed was a straightforward guide for my work, when I travel on business, so I avoid misunderstandings and get the language right when I talk. It would be really helpful if this author could write a book with a description of the standard language for each country and vocabulary lists for the most usual words. You could then look across. I am going to Australia, then I say this, I am going to Britain, then I say this, and so on 
 My real rating is 1.5 stars. The book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years. Readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest I've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, I learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent. Feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. Hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless. Bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. For newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. Next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition I picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. The book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper. If you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as I was when I selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), "A good walk spoiled" will suffice. If you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere 
 That's okay, Junior, we're just going to put the Lion King away for a little while (puts DVD in trash as kid cries, screaming).  There, see? He's just going to sleep. Now let's go sit over here and talk about why mommy put the Lion King to sleep (kid still screaming). See, honey, the Lion King is a movie that is made by bad, evil people. Even though the Lion King is cute and the cartoons are nice to look at, the people who drew the animals want to do VERY BAD things to you. They want you to HATE yourself, and you know what? These people are EVERYWHERE WE LOOK. They aren't just in the Lion King, they're on your school bus, in your classroom, and in the cafeteria. They might even be your teacher. They might even be people who call you their friend and say you're pretty. Even when they say you're pretty, they're just saying those things to make themselves feel good. What they're really trying to say is that they HATE you and they want to HURT you!! (kid screams again, now scarred for life) Now let's talk about how Mulan says bad things about Asian people, how The Incredibles reinforces stereotypes of female inferiority, about how Buzz Lightyear destabilizes the corporate-controlled capitalist economy that subjugates the Black race, and how Finding Nemo is homophobic. And don't worry, mommy will tell you about these big words after you eat your bean pie, child. Power to the people! 
 this is the cut down version of the 3 hour pilot that universel released in theaters after the show went belly up in '78. if you buy the whole series you can skip this pointless rehash that isn't that good or very well thought out 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 This movie added a world war, changed the continent the story took place on, and then brought the dead back to life. To me, once the essential elements of the author's story are that fundamentally altered, it's not fair to use the title anymore. I realize a number of the changes are a 'tribute' to the Shirley Temple version, but I'd hoped that since the new version wasn't a star vehicle they might have returned to more of the original storyline, but no. At least the first movie was on the correct continent! I like the movie, believe it or not, but it's not the story I read until the first book fell apart, and the changes to the story I listed weren't necessary, and it may have been nice to see that things can work out even when a parent stays dead 
 OH please only heard bit and pieces, and that was enough leave it up to the big kids this was a bad idea gone very bad.  Who is ever gonna remenbers any of these youngsters?  Most of thier voices have not even matured yet. 
 I read The Alchemist a few months ago and posted a glowing review of it on Amazon. I don't know what I was thinking. I must have been temporarily insane or something because looking back on it, I can't believe I fell for such a hollow load of rubbish. There were no real revelations to it at all. It's just a childish story with delusions of grandeur.  The idea that we are all looked after by the universe, if only we let ourselves go is a joke. Don't get me wrong, I know it sounds like a great idea, but let's face it, life's a lot more complicated than that.  Basically, The Alchemist and Veronika Decides to Die has about as much wisdom as you'd find in a fortune cookie. It's all just stuff to make you feel better about yourself even if your life is rubbish. What it comes down to is the idea that everything's fine as long as you're happy. So as far as my ex-girlfriend was concerned, she was happier spending time with some actor she met at her book group than she was with me, and that justifies her dumping me. I saw him as well. He was the usual type of scruffy look-at-me-I'm-so-dark-and-deep loser women always seem to want, even though they always say they want a nice guy in all those polls I read in their magazines. But hey, as long as she's living for the moment, and seizing life, then it's all fine and she can't possibly be wrong, can she? And she had the nerve to suggest in the letter she wrote to me that I should read Veronika Decides to Die and embrace my destiny. And she won't answer any of my calls because "now we need space to find ourselves", in other words, because she doesn't want to. She probably doesn't even know what she's done. And she definitely doesn't care. These books and this philosophy is so selfish and blinkered. Most people give up all this stuff when they leave university. Grow up and try living in the real world for once. This philosophy's only about looking after yourself at the expense of others.  I really think these books are dangerous. They fool people into thinking they're making the world a better place when really they're just acting like children. I feel really sorry for people who have bought into this. I just resent falling for it, and I'm angry at myself for having believed in it at the time. It makes me feel used, if you want the truth. I really feel like warning as many people so they don't make the same mistake that I did.  At least I can see it for what it is now. A complete waste of time. I just want my time back. I want it all back. Every last minute, every book I read, every film I saw, everything. But life's not like that. And it'll never be like this book either 
 Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 Adams is clearly a thoughtful Christian man who cares about husbands and wives. My problem: his definition of those roles are too old-fashioned and rigid for my taste. Just so you know, I am not a liberal woman who either ignores the Bible or is ignorant of its teaching; I know the Biblical teachings on marriage and it is their instructions I disagree with Adams about. He consistently calls the wife the "helper", which diminishes the aspect of partnership that I believe marriage should be. A leader and a helper is not a partnership, it is basically one central figure and a secondary figure who helps them. Adams stresses the specialness of a helper to uplift the concept, but is apparently unaware that the role still pushes a sense of lesserness on the woman's side because, if a wife is a helper, who is she helping? The husband! The man is still the central figure and the wife is not seen as his mate, but his "helper", a moon revolving around a sun. His beliefs basically come from the age-old concept of, in regards to a wife's role, taking the Biblical word "Submit" and turning it into "obey". Honey, they're not the same. Submission, unlike obedience, can be mutual and does not always have to do with authority. The concept of marital submission, I believe, is basically to surrender to another's needs and put the other before oneself; this does not at all necessarily mean obeying! Therefore, Adam's words that the husband is never to submit to the wife were incorrect. Certainly the husband is never supposed to obey his wife, but he is clearly expected to submit to her needs. The Bible stresses the importance of the husband laying down his life for his wife if necessary; that is HUGE submission on the husband's part. Submitting to a spouse should not be a matter of one ruling over the other, but rather a matter of both spouses making sacrifices out of love and respect for each other.   Adams' words of wifely obedience were very grating to me, especially when he tried giving examples of when a wife should refuse a sinful "command" from her husband. If a husband freely commands his wife, we've got bigger problems than whether the command itself is sinful or not. Adam's advice for the wife to "respectfully" refuse a sinful command also rather threw me, since his example of a sinful command was if a husband wanted his wife to play spouse-swap with another couple. His idea of what to say to such a husband? "I must respectfully say no. You must not ask me to sin and I cannot do that." Firstly, if a husband actually had the nerve to ask his wife to do something like that (or command it, in Adams' words), he'd be lucky if a disrespectful answer was all he got. Secondly, I defy anyone to find a self-respecting wife who actually talks that way. The monotone of that robotic answer gave me the impression that Adams' taken this obedience thing a little too far. This impression was strengthened with his example of how a counselor should advise a woman who "has not been a good helper". His advice: "They (wives) must be trained to put on helpful deeds, a step many counselors overlook." Maybe counselors overlook this because the concept of training women to be obedient helpers is, rightly, obsolete for most people.   Books like these, which so rigidly define the roles of spouses, have a tendency to simultaneously overcomplicate and oversimplify marriage (not an easy thing to do, but they manage). They oversimplify marriage because they seem to believe that if women just obey and respect their husbands and if husbands just love and nurture their wives, the marriage will go swimmingly. It is NOT that simple! Marriage is not a recipe with instructions, it's a union between two people who will occassionaly have conflicting ideas, and conflicts will NOT magically vanish if one spouse always gives in to the other. This method also overcomplicates things because it stresses the idea of training women to be followers rather than just letting them be led by love and respect for their husbands and letting the rest fall into place on its own.   Every marriage is different; it should be Godly, of course, but you cannot make the roles of spouses cookie-cutter. Christian books tend to do this mainly as a result of the author taking the Bible too literally. Adams does this by saying that, because the Bible tells the husband and not the wife to love, loving is primarily the husband's job. He went on to say that, if a husband complains that there is little love in the marriage, his counselor should tell him that it's mainly his fault! Honestly, this alarmed me more than his earlier words about counselors training women to be helpers (what kind of counselors are these, anyway?). To automatically blame either spouse for a marital problem based on your personal interpretation of the Bible instead of what's actually happening in the marriage is a little scary (if a professional counselor does this, it's downright terrifying). The interpretation itself is rather skewed; the Bible stresses on women giving respect and men giving love because respect is something that most men already give naturally and love is already something that women give naturally. It does NOT mean that the husband is the only one who has to love and the wife only has to respect, so to blame a lack of love automatically on the husband is simply unfair and silly. There are plenty of women who have a hard time loving and men who have a hard time respecting; you cannot simply assume which spouse is at fault because of Biblical instructions.   This is not a bad book, but unless you view marriage in the same rigid terms as Adams, it probably won't do much for you. If it focused more on mutual love and respect rather than defining one sort of behavior for one particular spouse, it would've worked a lot better for me. 
 The music of Dowland is wonderful - but Sting isn't up to interpreting it. You can't even distinguish the words half the time, just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. This music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...Sting, for all his merits, hasn't got that in his repertoire yet.   It's an exercise in pretention, laughable at times. The letter reading is ridiculous. I love both Sting's voice and Dowland's song, but this CD is a failure. 
 I'd like to know what's going on at Harvard University Press . . . have they launched a series of high school texts without telling anyone? A friend of mine suggested that we read this book and I was shocked by how mediocre it is.  Readers who are seeking a clear, documented and science-focused discussion of the debate about Darwinism versus design should order Simon Conway Morris' LIFE'S SOLUTION (published by Cambridge University Press, incidently).  His notion of convergence is basically a proxy for the design argument without the metaphysical baggage.  I don't know if physicists are more or less religious than the general population, but at least physicists are aware of how uncannily orderly the universe is, however they believe it came about.  Conway Morris brings this pespective to biology, which has been hi-jacked long since by the anti-teleologist gang of Darwinian popularizers. Ruse is one of them, albeit in sheep's clothing.  The first two pages of Ruse's Introduction were so simple-minded and patronizing that I almost couldn't bear to read them, but I struggled on and was rewarded by an ascent to mediocrity in the rest of the Introduction.  The crucial flaw in Ruse's book is that it is basically a history of philosophy and religion, and Ruse is apparently incapable of getting any of his material straight.  You may question how a nice man like Ruse succeeded in annoying me to this degree, but my concerns are more serious than the level at which Ruse has pitched his rhetoric: he doesn't understand his subject. For a guy to address the rational, fact-based vs. speculative/faith (or irrational) way of looking at the universe without once mentioning Spinoza is to commit malpractice: "Deus sive Natura" ("God, that is, nature" meaning that God is not distinguishable from nature) is the most devastating blow ever struck to the religious conception that observable design in nature is an implicit proof for the existence of a creator.  And looking at the list of books he has either written or edited, Ruse has established a niche for himself as an expert on design and theology as it relates to evolution!  A wondeful example of the power of the evolutionary strategy of mimicry . . . !  When Ruse does discuss the science, he repeatedly delivers himself of his real position by hiding behind that intellectual fraud and bully Dawkins. For example, Ruse's comment "The only possible response to Dawkins, is that, Darwin or not, you feel compelled to accept that our understanding of nature, of living things, is changed and illuminated and made complete by your acceptance of the existence and creative power and sustaining nature of God" (page 331) is pathetic blather-and both condescending and presumptuous since he is putting words in the mouth of his hypothetical religious person. However, the passage confirms what is evident throughout DARWIN AND DESIGN--that Ruse merely plays "good cop" to Dawkins' and Dennett's "bad cop"-while sharing with Dawkins an agenda of extreme intolerance to religious claims for the existence of any form of value or meaning. Pages 331 - 333 are unpersuasive to a degree that is simply embarrassing, and pages 334 - 336 sink to a level of bathos and obsequiousness that it is a rare experience to behold.  But back to Ruse . . . the last chapter, Chapter 15 "Turning Back the Clock" is the most interesting in the book, but it demonstrates that Ruse brought a knife to an intellectual gunfight. Ruse had already confirmed this for me-at the absolute latest-on page 208 when he writes, "The fairest conclusion, therefore, is that, with respect to the question of progress, people are very much divided." How can the author of a book called Darwin and Design: Does Evolution have a Purpose? avoid taking a position on the question of progress?  To return to the opening sections of Darwin and Design, Ruse's pastiche of Leo Strauss's distinction between Athens and Jerusalem (beginning page 11) bleaches out most of the content that made Strauss's essay famous . . . and that is being as kind to Ruse as possible. In his version, when he turns from Athens to Jerusalem, he ignores Judaism with the breezy comment "As we leave Athens for Jerusalem, we must move the clock forward, past the birth of Jesus and into the Christian era" (Page 19)! This is astounding, given that (a) Jerusalem had ceased to exist, having been sacked and razed by the army of Titus, in the era to which Ruse is referring-which vitiates the original logic of the Athens:Jerusalem metaphor, and (b) it ignores the fact that Judaism is the inalienable root of Christianity, and most relevant Christian ideas associated with his subject make their first appearance in Judaism.  Psalm 8 is the origin of the theme that the observable design and order of nature makes it clear that a divine and beneficent God created the universe. Strangely, Ruse postpones any mention of these obvious sources of the theological side of the design argument until page 306, when he quotes a phrase from Psalm 19--much less engages in any meaningful way with the key representatives of the tradition.  Ruse's discussion of Augustine is laughable-Augustine was indeed "much taken with the philosophy of Plato" (Page 20) but Augustine spoke/read not one word of Greek so Plato's influence on him was quite indirect, and as a former Gnostic Augustine was all too aware of the danger of creating radical distinctions between the physical world and the world of values.  Not a word from Ruse about that, but Hans Jonas, a student of Heidegger who wrote the great The Gnostic Religion: The Message of the Alien God and the Beginnings of Christianity realized that 19th century scientific innovation was not the real reason for the era's attack on the idea of order and design in the physical universe. Jonas was a student of Heidegger, and he wrote his thesis on the Gnostics, which became the book The Gnostic Religion. Jonas was intimately familiar with the implications of Dawin on Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, and understood their impact on Heidegger. After having studied the Gnostics he asked this fundamental question:   Let us stop to ask what has here happened to the old idea of the cosmos as a divinely order whole. Certainly nothing remotely comparable to modern physical science was involved in the catastrophic devaluation and spiritual denudation of the universe. We need only observe that this universe became thoroughly demonized in the Gnostic period . . . . If not science and technology, what caused, for the human groups involved, the collapse of the cosmos piety of classical civilization, on which so much of the ethics was built?  His answer was a radical alienation that developed in late antiquity between the physical world and the world of values. Christianity, exemplified by Origen and Augustine, insisted on the synthesis between the physical world and the realm of values. This is the real story which should have been told in Ruse's first chapters.  For example, his quotations from Lucretius and Hume make a point very different than the one he is trying to make. The issue about chaos or design is ancient (which is obvious to anyone with a passing familiarity with the Western tradition), and hasn't really changed much; partisans of both sides have risen in almost every generation. The fact that Hume sounds Darwinian only shows that Darwin fit a metaphysical template over a set of physical facts to make a heuristic point every bit as speculative as any Church dogma.  In any case, a force just as powerful as the skepticism of Hume and Spinoza in the attack on design arose from the ethical critique of Voltaire, and it is the moral critique that is probably the more influential one. Ruse waits until his last chapter to address this point, which is revealing because Darwin's biography seems to indicate that the ethical argument was decisive on his views about the existence of a divine creator. Ruse also acknowledges at the end of his book that Dawkins has been deeply influenced by the ethical issue as well. Why does Ruse park the discussion of such an influential issue at the back of his book?  The moral or ethical critique is the issue about how a God powerful enough to create the universe could permit the unspeakable suffering evident everywhere. The publication of Candide in 1759 was a devastating indictment of design on these ethical grounds.  Indeed, the death of Darwin's daughter--ie his personal reaction to the problem of inexplicable suffering-seems to have been a major factor in Darwin's personal loss of religious faith. He also comments in his writings (I can't remember where) in relation to a particularly horrible parasitic relationship between host and parasite, that he couldn't imagine how anyone could be aware of it and believe in a good creator God.  These are theological views, not scientific views. As such, they are answerable with theological responses. Darwinists ignore the doctrine of the Fall in their theological speculations. The doctrine of the Fall teaches that Satan corrupted creation and triggered the introduction of diseases, the redefinition of the relations between animals into the relationship of predator and prey, and other calamities which distorted the original natural order of the physical world. Paul famously describes the effects of Satan's intervention in the natural world in his letter to the Romans:  For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now. (Chapter 8)  Of course, this is theology, but so are Darwin's (and Dawkins's) sweeping statements, and if Darwin and Dawkins were moved to speculate about God's motives, why should they ignore a 3,000 year old tradition that declares that the natural world is strongly influenced by the adversary of God?  But the metaphysical assertions of Darwinism are nothing new, they are merely the other side of an ancient tradition. Nor is it news that every living being who is born must die. What was innovative was Darwin's decision to focus on death and the killing process as the efficient causes of the world we see around us, indeed the secret mechanism for the development of living beings.  Jonas makes interesting points in his Phenomenon of Life about how Darwinism in effect makes death and killing the creative force itself, and by asserting that adaptations were mutations, Darwinism destroyed any sense of an "essence of being" in its traditional, noble meaning. As Darwin wrote, "Thus from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely the production of the higher animals, directly follows (Page 649)", and this vision is the heart of the challenge posed by Darwinism to traditional ethics.  Darwin's belief in death and killing as the underlying creative force in the natural world is the lodestar of Darwinism; everything else about the theory has changed and changed again since the publication of The Origin of Species, but the idea that evolution occurs as a result of adaptation through natural selection, with the elimination of beings with less-efficient adaptations, remains the key idea. I'm not sure whether science has confirmed that Darwin's Malthusian logic is true for the animal world (it turned out not to be true with respect to humans), but in any event Darwin's emphasis on death rather than on life is the most enduring aspect of his Weltanshaung:  All that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase in a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some season of the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction. When we reflect on this struggle we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (Page 106)  What is particularly sinister is the solace Darwin offers his reader in the last sentence. This is not science, this is a dark theology.  Why did I react at such length to a mediocrity like Ruse? Because Ruse is a committed partisan and popularizer of misleading ideas-and by this I don't refer to scientific ideas-that have already caused humanity much sorrow. He acknowledges that Darwinism is a theology of death and then basically advises his reader to accept it as fact and move on. Like the follower and the sheep that he is, Ruse heads right down the well-trodden path to disaster pioneered by his intellectual betters. His final comment is a perfect expression of his limitations and poor judgment:  "This is what makes it all meaningful to the believer. Not proof, but simply flooding, overwhelming experience that could not be denied. In Raven's words . . . 'Here is beauty-whatever the philosophies and art critics who have never looked at a moth may say-beauty that rejoices and humbles, beauty remote from all that is meant by words like random or purposelessness, utilitarian or materialistic, beauty in its impact and effects akin to the authentic encounter with God.'  I have nothing more to add. (Page 336)"  Indeed not--Nietzsche concluded that transcendent values did not exist, and that all existing religions and systems of meaning were an illusion. Where did he look to find meaning? He wrote in The Birth of Tragedy (I think): "The world can only be justified as an aesthetic phenomenon"--precisely the position arrived at by the stumblebum Ruse as he reflects on what meaning is left to him by Darwin's theology of death. 
 nothing to write home about.  Lot of rap style rifts but nothing that challenged her vocally.  
 This was awful. I'm sorry I spent a penny on this. 
 This book was one of the worst reading experiences I've had.  I can't imagine how the information in this book could be useful in any way.  The contributors are long-winded and never really say anything substantial, probably due to poor editing.  STAY AWAY! 
 After enjoying the first Puddle of Mudd CD release extremely, I expected much more of their second CD, it was OK, but the music was uninteresting and lacked the passion and cohesion that the band had on the first album 
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 This movie was even more ignorant (in a bad way) compared to that other movie THE STUPIDS and I thought that movie was ignorantly bad as well. The name of the movie (dumberer) explains how retarded and unfunny this movie really is. The old dumb and dumber movie with jim carrey and jeff daniels is way better than this sorry excuse for comedy + it was part of a classic comedy which made lots of people laugh. Don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for comedy if you like dumb and dumber go for the unrated never before seen film of the old dumb and dumber instead it's worth every penny for comedy fans 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 I am a doctoral candidate and basically this book is not telling me how to write my dissertation and complete it giving 15 minutes a day to the writing (let alone the research) but really how to overcome blocks and start writing. Haven't we all been there, done that already?  To me, this book didn't offer anything I hadn't already read, figured out or been taught. Perhaps it would be a good book for procrastinators, but not for me 
 This book was recommended to me by an inspirational speaker who spoke at my college. I can see how this book can be meant to inspire, especially the stories pertaining to "live your dream". Yes, this book does give you hope and to a certain degree persuades you to break the shackles which you have created for yourself; to break the rut which sometimes becomes our lives. Having said that, some stories were (to be perfectly honest) cheesy. Corny, even. "The Hugging Judge"? Come on, that sounds more like a scene from a C grade kid movie. Even so, good read at times, inspiring also .....at times. Short concise stories. Worth a read if you are willing to forgive the extra extra dose of too much sugar in the sou 
 This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this 
 This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months.  About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono.  Had to send it in for repairs.  After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred.  Had to send it for repairs again.  A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease.  In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged.  I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night.  So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely.  When turned on it gives "HDD Error" message .  Resetting does not work.  The computer no longer "sees" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195.  Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit.  I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again 
 I very much enjoyed Prof. Halperin's early book, *Before Pastoral.*  There, his familiarity with classics and with the pastoral and bucolic traditions led to insightful observations about important literary modes, their definitive characteristics, and their evolution.  Unfortunately, *Saint Foucault* is symptomatic of a problem that has been plaguing English departments for some time now:  English professors dismiss their primary object of study---literature---as "bourgeois" or "elitist" or "oppressive" or "economically superstructural," and they become dilettantes in a mish-mash of fields that they end up calling "cultural studies" or "cultural poetics." As his work was received in North America, Foucault had a great deal to do with that shift in English studies. Nonetheless, I do find it amusing that Halperin can create an only half ironic "cult of personality" around the very man who argued that the category of the individual "subject"  was infinitely less important than a transpersonalized, discursive and ultimately ill-defined "POWER/KNOWLEDGE." Whatever my serious reservations about Foucault's ideas may be, I know for sure that he would find the idea of a "gay hagiography" very unsound.     
 This product looks and feels very flimsy. Do not be fooled by the flashy, metallic-looking picture. The plastic shell of this device is the quality of McDonald's toys. One would think that for $300, the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting.   The buttons are hard to press. In order to turn the device on, you have to press very firmly, which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell.  The cable port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy, and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads  to take place; otherwise, the connection will be lost.   I am a pre-medical student, and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product, believing that I could (for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk) scan my science textbooks in the library, including the colored diagrams, and in that way, I thought I would make back my investment, since textbooks go for at least $100 each. However, I now see that this belief was naive, to say the least. The Docupen is extremely difficult to use. The words come out distorted, like a jammed fax machine, and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDF's, the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate.  Furthermore, downloading is very slow (at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer), and since you can't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer, you will have to re-scan about 80% of pages due to stretches, smudges, blurriness, suspicious blank spots, and general illegibility.  I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this product. I would have saved myself a lot of money and time.  If you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents, then this product may work okay for you, although a digital camera will probably deliver better results. If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out "paperless" with this product, you will find yourself extremely disappointed.   Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer, it will not a good buy. The idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential, especially when coupled with a Tablet PC. However, the execution of the idea needs improvement. I hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years, at a price that is comparable to quality. 
 As usual, NT Wright has missed the Correct Answer in his quest to shore up the fading structure of Christianity.  In the Publisher's comment: "the early Christians' belief about the afterlife belonged firmly on the Jewish spectrum, while introducing several new mutations and sharper definitions."  In Judaism of the first century, there were many Resurrection cults.  The Pharisees believed in angels, demonic spirits and resurrection of the dead.    Again:  "How do we explain these phenomena? The early Christians' answer was that Jesus had indeed been bodily raised from the dead. No modern historian has come up with a more convincing explanation."  Sorry, but we HAVE come up with a more convincing explanation.  The Resurrection cults were looking for new victims.  When they heard about Jesus, they started telling people that "Yes, we saw the resurrected Jesus."  Because they were dishonest, even dangerous cults recruiting victims... I mean, members.    It's the kind of lie that a Resurrection cult would invent.  Even Paul said that Jesus was only the first-fruits of an imminent General Resurrection in 1 corinthians 15.  If Mr. Wright would stop trying to con us, he would have to admit that a LIE is simply a more convincing and believable explanation for the resurrection appearances of Jesus.  
 I had been having difficulties with my Sony CDPCX455 as well, everything from odd misloads to discs skipping, and decided to inspect all of my discs.  This thing has, so far, damaged about 25% of my collection significantly, and left another 40% or so with mild to moderate scuffs and scratches.  I know for a fact that these were inflicted by the player itself, as I am an audiophile and extremely meticulous about handling my discs.  I will not be buying Sony again, this is the last straw, and if I could sue them for the damages, I absolutely would.  Buyer beware of this extremely faulty product 
 I have been a big fan of Mr. Woods since "White Cargo."  His books are not great literature, but fun reads with interesting characters and the outcomes are never obvious.  This book fail in that I was not able to relate to the characters, too much sex with nothing to do with the story (I am not against sex but it should be relevant, not sensationalistic).  Well, you cant hit one out of the park every time.  If you Like Woods still of writing and storytelling you need to check out the cult favorite "Tourist in the Yucatan" cool thriller 
 There are three significant problems with this book. "Made in Detroit," is poorly written. Clemens thinks, "went over like a led balloon," is a fine simile. It is not. But Clemens begs his readers to compare him to Baldwin, Hemmingway, and others, a desperate attempt for sophistication he is unlikely to ever gain. (2) Clemens' book is racist and anti-working class to the core. Clemens clearly adopted his fathers' hatred of unions, and formed his own uncritical take on racism, expecting readers to chuckle at his portrayal of African Americans as "moolies." (3) Clemens knows nearly nothing important about Detroit. He views the city through an inverted telescope, each lens juncture narrowing his already myopic view; racism, sexism, the meanest forms of conservative Catholicism, his unexamined views of exploitation and resistance, all merge to give him a key-hole view of, not the city, but himself, his trifling family relationships, and his trembling edicts about his wife-who, I know from experience, is all aflutter about his critics. There are good books about Detroit, like "Whose Detroit?" or "American Odyssey" by Conot (openly fictional, unlike Clemens' piece), or Ewens, "Corporate Power and Urban Crisis," or Mirel's "Rise and Fall of an Urban School System." Clemens work is, flatly, too small-minded to be taken seriously. Only the fact that racism sells could lead local reviewers, and the publisher, to push this book. For those who seek my longer review of Clemens book, google "Michigan Citizen , Made In Detroit." I am the San Diego State prof critiqued in a review below. 
 I don't know if it works or not - I just received it and all I get on it is a low battery reading 
 1st song got me interested. Half way through, I started skipping out of boredom.  This music's been made before.  Goodbye and go home 
 Do NOT buy this product. I donated my entire box to the local food bank. Cream filling has some peculiar smell such that you will not feel like eating these cookies. Seriously stay away for this produc 
 I'm sure that my experience is not the norm, but its probably not uncommon either.  I absolutely hate this stuff.  Just about every eye doctor gives it away, probably because Alcon gives it to them free.  You get what you pay for.  Apparently, quite a few people are allergic to this stuff and get stinging or dry eye.  I'm definitely one of them.  If you can't wear contacts as long as you want, definitely try something different 
 Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.   I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.   The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time 
 Bjerknes book is very weak and more along the lines of a national enquirer essay. His sources are weak. His logic is weaker. Scientific essays are often based on the work which preceded them.  Science is the study the observable world and drawing conclusions which can be tested, proved or refuted. Usually these theories are not created in a box but with a knowledge of the thoughts and work of others. Einstein did not live in a box but studied the works of Newton, Poncaire, Mach and the rest. Like most scientists he added his own tremendous insight and deductive skills to the problems of the day and came up with a totally unqiue way of evaluating cosmology.   The simple truth is that in a scientific paper such as Einstein`s field theory, (or any other) the reference is inherent in the mathmatics. You can't write a formula and claim it as your own as others are familiar with the formula and will know the source. But when known formulations are used to derive new equations, that derivation is a unique entity. Did Galileo plagarize Copernicus? Did Kepler? Did Newton plagarize Euclid? Did Oppenheimer plagarize Einstein? The truth is there were many thoughts about relativism and open vs closed universes etc etc before Einstein. It was Einstein who put all the previous discussions in persepctive to come up with his original theory on special and general relativity, no one else came up with curved space as a dimension beyond our senses but not beyond our rational capacity to understand.  Eisntein is regareded as one of the greatest minds of humanity  because he truly was a intellectual and humanist giant among us. He did not plagarize or cheat, he did good science.  Giants always are targets of lesser minds who choose for uncertain motives to attack and slander. Einstein, fortunately, is one giant that forever will stand 
 Castillo tells a great story, even if there isn't much truth to it. Yes, all guerilla groups inevitably get involved with drugs. That's about where the truth ends. John Kerry's investigation went nowhere because there was no evidence, and he admitted that. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. also came up empty. So naturally it MUST be a dark conspiracy! Please. The contra leaders were adamant that their subordinates NOT raise money via illegal means. Besides, if the Contras HAD all of that drug money, they wouldn't have needed so much US funding. The cartels ended their association with contra armies by 1982. Bottom line: Castillo's book is not about drugs; it's a shameful attempt to rewrite history in favor of America's red enemies 
 I hate to admit I actually own this thing on VHS.  And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut of the movie too.  Double (and more) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of DVD.  We get at least four issues of Terminator 2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  I personally am sick of it.  Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet.  No wonder I've taken to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library.  No, you generally don't get them the day they come out.  But honestly, when was the last time you purchased a movie from Hollyweird that was worth keeping?  Don't do it 
 I checked this book out at the local library along with a text on how to transfer course units from a business major into psychology. This book made the reference text read like a novel. Truly dreadful. Avoid this even if it's free 
 I wanted to take a quick look over the internet but the people who programed this site will not let you scan the book for one second. It is sad that you would have to by the book just to look for one sorry thing. And I am ashamed at the situation.And at the creaters of this site for not giving anyone the chance to look before they buy 
 now, i gave this ablum a pretty nasty beating earlier, but i feel that it deserves more, not too great, but still...  afi....where do i start? ill admit one thing first. this was the album that singlehandedly started turning the gears to my interest in anything goth... period!..i do think that i wouldnt have ended up listening to the misfits, damned, cramps, etc etc as early as i did if it werent for afi. i will give this album points in that aspect, but as far as the actual music goes, i have outgrown it like i did with GI joes. basically, this album was recommended to me after i had gone into a rancid, nofx, and pennywise frenzy(bands i still love and loyally listen to today!)...and yes, it was amazing to me when my collection consisted merely of those bands. songs like days of the phoenix, lost souls, sacrifice theory, and ever and a day had me coming back for more......so forward to today...the album is too cheezy and whiny to be considered goth punk....let alone any of those genres periond(well okay, maybe a little wee bit of punk)....but basically, this is emo for little kids who have yet to experience any real pain...and this band portrays the selfish "me first" scene movement of today.  yes kids, REAL emo actually conquers, inspires and opens your eyes rather than provide selfish feelings, tim burton wannabe imagery, contrived poetry, and bad relationship stories...and if you want real emo, stick with Rites of Spring..but if you want hardcore, go with afi's early stuff. its much much better 
 [...] which ask for evidence of Ramakrishna's true mysticism. I tell them that the evidence is the devotees themselves who follow His teachings. You cannot create wise people like Vivekananda and his brother disicples just by following a "mad" man. What about the visions of Ramakrishna devotees and saints? Yeah you can rubbish ALL of them as hallucinations. Well that is not your evidence anyway, right? I saw thousands and thousands of saints and devotees who cite Ramakrishna as their guru and these people are the best among men - you feel it when you are in their midst and their life is an example (again an unscientific mind trashes ALL of them). Are all of these men getting inspired by a "mad" man then? Are ALL their visions, wisdom and experience false then? How far can you go and say ALL are cheating without even provideing evidence and deluding yourself? Now, why talk of others. I can best talk about myself as evidence. I have seen perceptible change in myself for better after reading and following His teachings. If you really need evidence against Kali's Child - I tell you to first read His life and teachings and IMPLEMENT in your life. You can see yourself who He is and everything will be self-evident. There cannot be a best subject of study than yourself (your mind). And I am sure you cannot/wont do that becasue as yours is a weak mind that cannot experiment anything, but likes to see what it wants to! By the way, what is in one's mind, thats what one sees. Even the kissing of Jesus feet by adultress woman can be seen in a perverted way if the person's mind is heaped in lust. As Jesus Himself said, "Blessed are those who are pure, for they shall see God." Kali's Child is a fit testimony to that teaching! You yourself can experience how you see "things" in others that dont exist (in other person) just because your mind "sees" and "thinks" so. If you have not learnt these simple lessons yet, well only prayer to God will help that your mind might grow 
 I don't doubt that UFO's exist, but this book is a sorry excuse for what the title promises: The real story of unidentified flying objects. It seems to me that the author is jumping to conclusions.. 
 The main idea is Ribsy the dog was gotten himself hopelessly lost in huge shopping mall parking lot in a rainstorm. Ribsy runs all over looking for the Huggins` family car.    Detail one. One if the detail is when Ribsy got a bubble bath!! Joy folly sally and Lisa began to swish their hand in the water to make bubbles, lot of them. Giving a dog a bath was fun, but was even more fun. Eight hands and a whole bottle of bubble bath can make a lot of bubbles. The girls screamed with pleasure as Ribsy found him surrounded by billows of bubbles that were rising higher and higher.  Detail two. The second detail is when Ribsy when to all club for ladies. The ladies of the club all gasped and applauded at him that he dropped his pipe. Mrs. Frawley picked it up and poked it into his mouth once more. "Sit up Rags, "She directed. "Sit up boy. Obediently Ribsy sat up. All the ladies laughed. Isn't that cute? They murmured. Isn't that adorable. Just like a little old man."   Detail three. The third detail is at the lunchtime Ribsy got in line and went to the cafeteria where he finished the sandwiches of those. Who asked him to-except peanut-butter sandwiches? These Ribsy would sniff and politely refuse. Peanut-butter stuck to his teeth. After lunch he lay at the back of the room with his nose on his paws, waiting for school to be out so that he could play with anyone who wanted to play with a friendly dog. It was a pleasant life of a dog.   My conclusion. I did like the book because; I don't like to read books. But if you do like to read I recommend this book for you.    
 The intructors areant that motiviating. I dont really like the intructors because they instruct with almost to life in their voices or in their eyes. Everytime I do my workout they look more like female robots than real people. It is a fast workout and will take time to adjust to the movements. It would be a good idea to preview before you buy 
 I came to this course after taking honors freshman physics at Yale with An Intro to Mechanics by Kleppner and Kolenkow.  And, unfortunately, this book just is not as good.  The mathematical derivations are often tedious and uninsightful, a good description as well for many of the problems.  In addition, many of the problems, particularly the tougher ones, are already worked out in the text.  For me, the text is a combination of mediocre treatment of material with exceptionally poor problems.  The problems in this text are, in general, easier than those in K&K, but they often take three times as long to write out.  Many of them are exercises in 10th grade algebra, or 12th grade calculus (read:  horrible integrals and looong expressions to simplify).  What is required is not insight, but exceptional care at not making simple errors and patience for long derivations of often obvious results.  For a physics major, this book just seems like a colossal waste of time and money.  If you want reinforcement of concepts, turn to Feynman in his lectures.  For insightful and challenging mechanics (though Hamiltonian and Lagrangian dynamics are missing), Kleppner and Kolenkow is a far better text 
 Losing Iraq illustrates what went wrong with planning for post-liberation Iraq although not for the reasons its author, a Council on Foreign Relations staffer, intends. In the run-up to the Iraq war, the State Department hired Phillips to moderate seminar discussions among Iraqis. He uses this limited experience to conclude that the cause for difficulty in post-liberation Iraq was not lack of planning but rather a failure to listen. "How could such noble intentions [Iraq's freedom] go so wrong?" he asks. "The White House and Pentagon political appointees thought they could liberate a county without talking to those they were liberating," he replies.  Phillips appears unaware that every Iraqi who met with him also visited the Pentagon, National Security Council, and Central Intelligence Agency. U.S. officials would meet almost daily at the National Security Council, chaired by officials such as Zalmay Khalilzad, then the president's special assistant for Iraq, and Stephen Hadley, then-deputy national security advisor.  Rather than researching and analyzing prewar planning, Losing Iraq becomes a testament to the author's ego and pettiness, features that caused Iraqis and U.S. officials alike to push Phillips aside. He describes Kanan Makiya, with whom he clashed on issues including de-Baathification, as poisoned by neoconservatives who transformed him from an academic to a polemicist. Most Iraqis and Americans differed and questioned whether Phillips's hostility was due to jealousy of Makiya's prominence in fields in which Phillips sought to compete. Phillips also writes that he initiated ideas like a Kirkuk commission to adjudicate competing property claims but was ignored. Actually, such a commission was up and running weeks before his epiphany.  Phillips revises events liberally, saying, for example, that he and Ryan Crocker, deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, opposed the establishment of the Coalition Provisional Authority because it did not empower Iraqis. Actually, Crocker opposed the transfer of sovereignty.  The irony of Phillips's argument is hubris. He chides Bush administration officials for not listening to Iraqis, but he himself did not bother to travel to Baghdad in the wake of Iraq's liberation. Rather, as revealed in a Wall Street Journal review by Rob Pollock, he lifted descriptions from newspapers. His experience in Iraq was limited to a few brief trips to Iraqi Kurdistan before the war, the sheltered guest of a Kurdish politician.  Losing Iraq may try to castigate the White House but instead becomes an example of the arrogance about which so many Iraqis complain. Phillips treats Iraq as a template upon which to lay down his theories. The Iraqi voice is subsumed to his own. If the White House really lost Iraq-the success of the Iraqi elections suggests otherwise-it was because it subordinated the voice of Iraqis to outside advisors like Phillips, more interested in pumping up their own importance than in the welfare of Iraq.

 It really is to bad that a book like this would ever be allowed to be published.  Howard Sounes is just another name on a list of men that invaded the life of this man.  What kind of man would take information from every source he could find about a person that he never knew and write a book about it.  Howard is the prime example of a man that Bob most desperately tried to avoid throughout his entire career.  It truly is a shame that everybody keeps giving the character Bob Dyaln reasons to regret talking to people on paper in the first place.            
 In previous reviews the aspect ratio of this DVD set is often mentioned. I have to agree with those reviewers who state that the aspect ratio is wrong. It may be true that the series was shot in 16:9 and I remember seeing it that way on Belgium TV, but this is not that version! When watching these DVDs it very soon becomes clear that something is wrong: the top of people's heads are frequently cut off, sometimes an action that takes place at the bottom of the screen is not visible. I also own the Dutch DVD-set of this great series which has 4:3 aspect ratio, no extras but very cheap, less than $10,00. Comparison showed that the Signature Editon used the 4:3 version and chopped off the upper and lower part to get a 16:9 version. Again, if the series was originally shot in 16:9 than this is not that version! Shame on you HBO for passing this chopped up version of a brilliant series as an expensive so called Special Edition 
 According to Richard Montauk, a sucessful law career can only be acheived by graduating from an Ivy League law school. He isn't even practicing law at this point! Instead, he's taking the money of naive prospective law students. This book is not particularly well-written or helpful. The information it contains is nothing new or astounding. In fact, the only thing I really learned from this book is that Richard Montauk is an egotisical, money-hungry bore. 
 Rather a disappointment as none of the ads for this book hinted at the strong new age slant of the healing techniques. For each health topic the remedies cover areas like Acupressure, Aromatherapy, Ayurveda, Flower Remedy/Essence Therapy, Food Therapy, Homeopathy, Hyrotherapy, Imagery, Juice Therapy, Massage, Reflexology, Relaxation & Meditation, Vitamin & Mineral Therapy and Yoga. Most of these would seem to appeal to the esoteric new age mindset. In my opinion, about 30 percent of the 700+ page book are based upon useful scientific data. Overall, it was disappointing. I am glad I bought the paperback version and not the $20+ hardback copy 
 The personnel responsible for making this wretch of a film should be ashamed.  Way to sell out 
 I received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam (also shortly after they were installed). I came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem I know not to waste my money. They are very unique and I do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality 
 In my opinion, Mr. Todd writes books by some type of writing formula.  No matter the subject, He uses the same source material for each of his books.  I find them shallow and sophmoric. They are like an expanded version of a college freshman term paper 
 As a long-time home espresso brewer, I was delighted to receive the EC140B as a holiday 2004 gift. It was a nice upgrade from my existing machine.  Well, it's been less than 2 months and I'm glad I didn't toss the old machine when I got the deLonghi because without it I'd have no morning brew. The rubber grommet that holds the screen snugly within the filter head has completely fallen apart rendering the EC140B unuseable for want of this little piece of rubber.  I've visited deLonghi's website, but it's incomplete (doesn't appear to have been updated since it went online in March 2004) and the Customer Service phone number in the documentation that came with the machine is "No longer in service." I'm willing to accept a percentage of product failure, but deLonghi can't or won't stand behind their product quality. Beware 
 I really enjoyed this book. I am a Counsellor and a Coach and have already had several opportunities to relay some of the information in it to clients of mine who in turn have found it concrete and easy to understand. There is a very good section on children that all parents would do well to read 
 OK First of All IM NOT A KID I'm just to lazy to sign in. Anyway I was in NY this past weekend and I saw someone who was selling CD;s on the street that WERE NOT Bootlef [Amazing To See In NY] anyway they were used CD's ranging from $8-$3 per disc. Anyway since I'm a DJ i decided to buy a s**T load of music and i saw this CD for $3 so i grabbed it assuming it was a new release or old music but I was sure people would wanna hear it so when i got into my car i tested the discs out [They were used so you can't be sure] and this is just interviews and info about her so i personally dont like it, my girl somewhat enjoy's it but she of course prefers her music if your a gwen fan get it but if you just want music... Don't Waste Your Time. It's actually a pretty good biography i fyou like that kinda thing so we'll just i recomend you only buy it if you kno  its not music.   [Another Half Asleep/Hung Over Review By]  ***DJ C.I.** 
 I purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th Grade. I am very glad that I read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it. This book is about gang violence (although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders.)  The book is also about angry, jaded, hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes.   The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)   Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.   The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is. Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)  I knew that it was questionable whether or not I would allow my son to read this book.  I read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book.  There isn't.   This is the first book that I have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else. Save your money.  I don't care how many awards this book received.  It is pure trash 
 there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was "well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future" it was too focused on that ...I liked "Stranger In a Strange Land" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page. 
 "In Good Company" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise.  If it had ended 15-20 minutes before it actually did, I would give it three stars instead of two.  I admit there were quite a few times when I laughed a bit to myself, but it didn't make me fall off the couch or anything. There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced.  Overall it isn't an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling.  Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace 
 If you have ever purchased a Disneyland Birmbaum book before you will not need to buy another. I have the 2003 book and only two short pages were added for the "50" celebration. On top of that, attractions and dining listings are either listed wrong, missed marked on maps, or not listed at all! One dining spot that is not listed for example is the Hungrey Bear restaurant in Critter Country. I also checked my 2003 book and low, it's not listed their either. They just keep getting your money by reprinting the SAME OLD THING. I DO NOT recommend! 
 I really wanted to learn about this fascinating story: the dynamic personalities, the diametrically opposite companies, and their highly publicized $170b(?) merger. And I am willing to overlook a prejudiced author delivering a biased tome as long at he puts forth a good story. But this guy simply cannot write. The book is, at best, boring. Klein gives us inessential speculations on the characters' childhoods while never developing any of the real players. I like to be able to glean some insight as a result of reading a book like this but the author serves up absolutely nothing. Of course there are many lessons to be learned from this dot-com merger folly -- just not any from THIS book. Whatever positive reviews this book has received must have come from other `reporters' who mistakenly think that they too can cash in on their own utterly worthless 3-400 page book. In fact, read all the 5-star reviews and ask yourself if they were written by the author's friends.  If you enjoy well-written books of this type try: "Taken For a Ride" by Bill Vlasic & Bradley Stertz, "The One Best Way" by Robert Kanigel, "Goldman Sachs" by Lisa Endlich, "Inside Intel" by Tim Jackson, "When Money is King" by Richard Hack, "Consulting Demons" by Lewis Pinault, "Wireless Nation" by James B Murray, "Oil & Honor" by Thomas Petzinger, "Dark Genius of Wall Street" by Edward J Renehan, or "Steve Jobs & the Next Big Thing" by Randall Stross 
 I read this book after coming across it on a "most important books ever" list. I found it very hard to get through. Approximately half-way through the book I found myself counting down the pages until I finished it. This is not a book to read if you're looking to be entertained, however if you're looking for a good bit of culture/history I would think this would be a decent pick. Some of the passages involving the main character and his love interest are very well written and beautiful to read. In fact, I re-read some of the passages again just for the majestic quality of the author's writing. As a college junior with little knowledge of or interest in African culture I did not enjoy reading this book, however I may try again in the future to see if I can get more out of what others have deemed a very important and worthy novel 
 The faith of George Bush is in what? Money? Oil? His dad?  My Lord said Love thy enemy and do good to those who harm you Not kill a million iraqis for oil fields  My Lord said it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven  Not give all our national treasury and indebtedness to the wealthiest corporations while impoverishing our people and leaving our elderly and infirm to drown in a rainstorm  My Lord said Blessed are the peacemakers not those who keep changing their lies about going to war.  What is his faith again? My Lord said: Not all those who cry Lord, Lor shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  My Lord said it. I believe it. Case closed.  What his faith all about? Material possession does not prove election anymore than faked vote counts   SEll all that you have and give the money to the poor and then come follow me, said the Lord, and you will have riches in heaven.  Blessed are the POOR reads his Sermon on the MOunt in Saint Luke  Anyway what's that cover photo supposed to be? Mr. Jim Beam make him nauseous again? Or does he hang his head in shame for the one million dead for their oil fileds in Iraq? FOr our stolen elections? For the dead of KAtrina? For murdering our US Consitution and Bill of Rights? No, it's gas. Hoping no one notices he cut it. No, looks like he's controlling a leak into his Depends.  
 This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money 
 Of all the textbooks I've had, from elementary school through graduate school, this is easily the worst one I've ever had, for any course.   First of all, the authors so redundantly use the word "whilst" and the phrase "rules of the game" that it really gets on your nerves. My classmates all agree with me on this point.   Second, speaking of getting on your nerves, half of what these authors say is, "...as we talked about in the previous chapter" or "as we'll talk about in the next chapter". There is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25% of its size, and hell, it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course.   Third, the authors should win a Pulitzer prize for flowery language. They seem more interested in impressing me than educating me. Their sentences are far too long. They don't know the meaning of clear and concise, and I think they should all go back to English Composition 101. They'd be great politicians, because never have I heard anyone say so much and yet say so little....over and over and over again.  The book is a like an inflated academic paper...and it's BORING. If ever a topic begged for a case-study approach, it's this one, and this book is not the answer. Save your money, and beg your instructor not to use this text.  
 The previous reviews gave me the impression there would be great concept art in this book. Instead the few artworks are completing lacking in imagination, technical skill and the "Disney" design feel. The artworks have a '70s look about them, with psychodelic pastel rainbow streaks smeared across what would otherwise be dull sketches. Take away the colour and the line art is woeful. This guy cannot even draw a decent Mickey Mouse (a half talented 10 year old could do better). The best visuals herein are the photos of the theme park. Don't waste your money on this guy ... like Disney did 
 Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this thing like I did.  It's not worth reading.  The coverage of the API is incomplete, to put it nicely, and the explanations are convoluted and confusing.  Not worth the money at all 
 these guys are whack.. this just shows how easy it is to become a rap artist these days.  this album doesnt hold one good song its terrible. its true you cannot spell crap with out a R-A-P.  want a good album CHROME- STRAIGHT TO THE PROS     
 I bought this album for their two hit songs.  They are great.  The rest of the album, however a nice funk experience, is loaded with explicit language.  I cannot play it around my kids 
 To borrow from a previous reviewer:  A movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering.  
 I'm a big fan of the Dark Hunter series and I looked forward to this book. Unfortunately this book doesn't live up to her previous standards. It was boring and hard to get through which has never happened to me with this author before. I seems like the dream hunter idea hasn't been completely fleshed out yet and isn't quite ready for publication.  
 We purchased a partial set of this dinnerware last year and it was made in the USA.  We completed the set and it is now made in China.  We were very disappointed because we support USA products and this was a big part of our decision for the initial purchase.  The China product is a bit different.  The accent color is precise with each color being separate and distinct from each other where the USA product colors are mottled and blended together, looking artsy and having a pleasing meld of color.  Also, the items from China have more irregularity in shape and the coffee cups came with two different handles.    We decided to let it go rather then have half a set and over time replace them.  We do enjoy the large proportions of this set and the nice heft they have.   
 My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green "on" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes. 
 The control of PowerPoint is excellet except the blank screen button is often accidentally pressed during the presentation.  The laser is very weak and dies often in the middle of a presentation-rather frustrating.  I liked the flash memory initially, but found it troublesome because it takes extra time for the PC to recongnize it and a folder always pops up 
 I bought this book as a primer reference to patents.  What I got was a dictionary of words.  This book pretty much is a dictionary without a lot of explanations.  Really basic terms also.  A lot of basic paraphrasing instead of actual text from the 35 USC manual 
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 This book appears to be fine for a general review of the Access topics, but is lacking in detail for the test. I found that the book alone would have been totally inadequate for the certification test. The MeasureUp online training had value, but it too was limited. Access 2003 has a sorting and grouping icon, yet what I found was that I needed to use Access 2000 procedures for this and other MeasureUp tasks, without the newer icons. The MeasureUp study guide was well-presented, yet I faced a culture shock on test day. The questions were formatted differently, the questions significantly different than the way MeasureUp presented them. MeasureUp wrote their questions in a clearer manner than the test, but the problem is that I needed to see the questions as they would be on the test. The text is essentially a step-by-step book, not of test-taking value. I will keep it as a reference, which was not my reason for purchasing it. The MeasureUp training was great, but not related to the actual test 
 "A startling piece of detective work," says the Amazon book description, "that combines history, literary criticism, esoterica and archaeology, Genesis of the Grail Kings is the ultimate story of earthly kingship from its Mesopotamian foundation."    Well, yeah, sort of.   I have been expanding my mind with crackpot literature for many years and I must say that this is as fine an example of such bilge as I have ever seen. It starts off with a bang, being forwarded by "HRH [no less!] Prince Nicholas de Vere KGC, KCD / Princeps Draconis, Sovereign Grand Master / and Magister Templi of Sarkany Bend / The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court and Order".  Well, I'm impressed.  Sure I am.  Although I can only wonder why HRH has not also taken on the duties of Master of the Buckhounds, Groom of the Back Stairs, Archbishop of Titipu, and Lord Mayor, both acting and elect.    Gardner casts a wide net.  He offers aliens from outer space who may or may not have originated on a Kuiper Belt object with an orbital period of 360 (or perhaps 3600) years and who may have interfered with human evolution in some not quite specified way about 6,000 years ago to create--ta-dah!--Adam and Eve.  These aliens, of course, were the immortal gods of the earliest Mesopotamians who have ... well ... died out, leaving behind a line of alien/divinely appointed kings to reign over nothing much down to this very day.  I'm not making this up, you know!  Gardener also offers a revised history of the text of the Bible which, among other things, proves pretty conclusively that God did not dictate it to King James after all.    Gardener is also very big on offering the TRUTH.  Since the TRUTH is radically inconsistent with the writings of a couple of millenniums of historians and four centuries of post-Renaissance scholarship, Gardener politely corrects them all.    And he throws in other goodies, too.  Consider this passage from page 204 of the paperback edition: "Another feature of the white powder [the Philosopher's Stone] is that even its 56 per cent substance (that is the sample excluding the 44 per cent light content) can be made to disappear completely from sight, moving itself into another dimension. At that stage of experimentation (which, incidentally, can be wholly reversed) not only does the invisible substance weigh less than nothing but the pan in which it was  sitting also registers less than its zero point starting weight.  This particular aspect of the fire stone's has some stunning consequences, as will be discovered when the latter stages of our investigation move into the anti-gravitational sciences of  ancient Egypt."  Now, THAT's what I call top of the line woo-woo!  (An opinion which, incidentally, cannot be reversed at all.)  As book-length ravings go, this one is actually rather entertaining.  It contains a considerable amount of information, both accurate and new.    The accurate information includes details about the development of the currently accepted text of the Bible and the contents of a substantial number of cuneiform inscriptions from Mesopotamia.  A hundred and fifty years ago, when this was first published by hard-headed, sharp-eyed scholars, mostly of the German persuasion who were known as the higher critics, it was hot news.    Gardener's new gems of information, the experiments disproving the universal attraction of gravity, the long, long genealogies largely supported by moonstruck etymology, the literal truth of the venerable ages of the Biblical patriarchs and the even longer-lived antediluvian kings of Sumer, the oddly incompetent god-aliens from space, the endless riffs about the nature of myths and historical research, they are all woo-woo.  Just plain, sweet woo-woo masquerading as something useful 
 Nothing new for the 3-D afficienado here.  First timers will be amazed.  Doesn't have the artistic advances of a 3-D Book of Angels or Henry's Gift 
 I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS 
 I have to confess right now, I'm not an audoiaphobe (or whatever it's called).  I just wanted relatively inexpensive headphones to plug into my hard drive so I can listen to music while I'm at work (and block out all the annoying noise around me).  I had the Sony headphones which were similar to the JVC but I ran the ear bud over with my chair and crushed it.  So I thought I'd get something similar but a little cheaper.  I wish I had bought the Sony again.  These are ok, but everytime I move my head, I get static.  So unless I'm sitting very still, the sound quality is not that great.  Of course, when I am sitting still, they're fine and get the job done, but that pesky static every time I turn my head or move is very annoying.  I won't buy these again. 
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 This is a sprawling, lazy account. It was moderately useful as a complement to Donald Prater's far more concentrated 'A ringing glass', but if I hadn't read that book first I wouldn't have formed much of a picture of Rilke's life. There are a few interesting stories found here which don't  appear in the other book, but on the whole it is totally inferior 
 That's funny I just saw the last review and the same thing happened to my set. I ordered it and crossed my fingers but the only one that was messed up was the dracula disc. It was dislogged from it's incasement and was just brutally scratched. Looked like someone took the DVD and just put it on their shoes and skipped around all day. I wasn't sure if I should have ruturned the whole set because that was the only one. But why can't they just get it right and make those DVD's secure for transportation? If anything their probably getting more returns then sales. I really think the collection is cool but man if you could just get one that works. I am awaiting my second replacement now and we shall see... 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 Poorly edited book by an individual who is very knowledgeable on the subject.  Book would benefit greatly by the use of color photos (why black & white in this day and age?).  Fraught with misspellings and generally a good cure for insomnia.  The info is there, but it's not an enjoyable way to get it.  Book has interesting testimonials from famous Gretsch owners. As a reference work, it stops too soon.  Later company history and products not covered. The author obviously knows his subject, but a decent editor would have made a "ho-hum" book a real "Must Read". 
 Less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition, this book more aptly excerpts the author's personal conflicts with human relationships.....a one-on-one wrestling match with the Self with no spectators and no judges. The book is a good read for academic analysis, but not so fun for venturist philosophy 
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 Difficult to put into words but I found Hitchen's writing rather high brow and rambling.  Off on tanjents.  I enjoyed the book somewhat but it seemed more of a compact history rather than a 'good look' at who Jefferson was as a person 
 I wanted to find out about modern plumbing (like PEX)and what kind of tools, code changes, etc. that are necessary for installing PEX plumbing.  Not in this book.  That information must have fallen through the cracks (no plumber joke intended).  Author is stuck in the past.  Needs to be updated, revised, or recycled.  Kind of a bummer.  Now I have a book that I can't use.  Sweating copper...come on now.  The rest of us have made it to the 21st century 
 This book may be interesting to experts who want to see how the first "editors" Todd and Higginson, alterated Dickinson's poems, "by smoothing out the rhymes and meter, changing line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the local area", as the introduction plainly states.  Is it naivety, stupidity or cold deliberation that this book is still sold under the innocent title of "collected poems", as if it presented the original texts? It should come with a warning 
 This book is an attempt to stifle ministries aiming to encourage gays and lesbians to become straight. It claims that "Ex gays" do not exist and are noting but lies.  The book only gives evidence to support the author's views but conveniently leaves out material on the thousands of former gays and lesbians (including celebrities) who have renounced their homosexuality.  Actress Anne Heche is probably the most famous former lesbian today. She ended a 3 year relationship with Ellen DeGeneres and she is now married (to a man) and has a son 
 I listened to the audio version of this book. While most of the things said in this book may be true, it appears a bit biased. In addition to facts, the author uses some adjectives which show her personal dislike of the famous couple.  In the end, I had an impression that this book grew out of author's frustration upon Mark Rich pardon. Many chapters are dedicated to that case.  A disproportionately large portion of the book is devoted to two topics: pardon and donations. At one point the audio book spends a large amount of time only listing names of who donated what item. It goes on and on and on with names that make no sense and contribute nothing much to the story. That could have been moved to the appendix to keep the flow going.  I was hoping to find details about mischievious behavior by Clinton staff during the last days. There was no mention of that 
 Liza Picard's book on mid-eighteenth century London is essentially for those who like to dip into a topic and have a short attention span. Though long, there is less to it than first meets the eye.  This is history-lite and as such would probably have found limited favour with Dr Johnson himself. Ms Picard has used some interesting material from medical sources of the day but her reliance on The Gentleman's Magazine as a source shows in the notes at the end of the book. There is little attempt to relate all this detail to the actual events of the times, so the reader is left with a far from balanced picture of what mid-eighteenth century London was really like 
 The publisher and editor should be ashamed for producing this book. As an editor, I'm embarrassed for them. Sailing is a terrific sport and I sincerely hope that the poor unsuspecting souls who bought this book expecting clear, concise, and organized instruction, are not turned off. Sentences are missing, typos abound, illustrations are incomplete. AND, those folks who gave this book a glowing review need to have their eyes checked. IF YOU PURCHASED THIS BOOK, RETURN IT AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK (I did) 
 I wanted the most recent publication of this book and Amazon sent an old one. It was published in 1998 and the newest publication is 2005.  I am not satisfied with Amazon.com.  You stink 
 I can't believe I wasted as much time as I did on this book.  This is perhaps one of the worst slap-together-a-story jobs in recent publication.  I was looking for a slice of NY life, and what I got was no Big Apple--just a rotten apple.  Does anyone want to buy my copy (only about 3/4 read and slightly vomit stained) 
 As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found "Altered States", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of "hack movie making". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity 
 This is first Canon product that has disappointed me with its quality. They must acquire them from their Chinese supplier for about 98 cents. This plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated to the detente position. I bought it to use with the Canon 250D close-up lens and it's barely adequate for that function. Canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one of these hockey pucks. 
 With as many big names in this I thought it would be amazing....well, it is a corn ball adventure..its set in ancient times yet one man beats someone up, flies off whips out a pair of modern day sunglasses and puts them on and POSES!! (shakes head) its things like this that REALLY hurt the film for many kung fu/hong kong film fans. I REALLY wanted to like this film but couldn't get past the ridiculousness of it. Now corny can be ok at times but this is just rubbish 
 The application of the Golden Rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good.  John Maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule, its worldwide acceptance, and how we can apply it to our everyday.  It was more like a walk down memory lane; to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us.  However I do have a few concerns with Mr. Maxwell's book.  First there might need to be a better job at researching Fletcher thoughts on Relativism...in his book he labels Fletcher as the father of mordern day Realativism...quoting (or rather misquoting) Fletcher's statement that love can justify anything.  I am in not postition to defend Fletcher, for I am not that familiar with his work, however he does not just use the term love.  Rather he uses the term Agape Love, coming from the ancient Greek...the highest and purest form of love...one that God would have for us, a term any minister or pastor of the Christian Faith would know very well.  Second after page 86 the book get repediative and seems to get off track.  This links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track, as it turns into an advertisement for Mr. Maxwell's corporation, the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of Buy...buy...buy our products.  Not what I expected and was somewhat disappointed.  In short taking some know concepts, putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored.  Part of the disappointment is that I know this book could be better 
 For the life of me, I cannot understand why this book and so many others completely fail to mention Commodore and it's contributions to the PC world. 1st millionth computer sold with VIC-20. Most computers ever sold with C64 (over 20 million!). First multitasking, etc. with Amiga. etc., etc... Commodore created the first, affordable home computer. They introduced computers to the masses. While Apple was trying to sell their Apple II series for astronomical prices, C64 was being sold for 1/3 - 1/5 the price.  I trully hope that in the end, the historical accounts of the birth of a personal computer will give credit where the credit is due - Chuck Peddle for creation of the 6502 processor, and Commodore for creation of the most sucesfull computer ever made - C64 
 I am sure this product works wonderfully with most devices, however, with my Panasonic SV-SD80 MP3 player, this product was not compatible.  I could still transfer files to it but it could not be formatted to SD Audio support 
 It is hard to believe - but IT DOES NOT OPEN CANS.  Seriously.  Christmas morning with food preps well underway we discovered our brand new opener would not open cans.  Unbeliveable! 
 I've owned one of these for about a month.  It's a total waste of money.  It rarely sprays, just a steady stream of oil.  I'm diabetic and thought this would be a good way to restrict my use of oil on salads, etc.  I am so very disappointed......   I'll try to find another brand that is more reliable and that does what it's advertised 
 I've looked at IJ books on the shelves for years, but never read any of her work.  This was my first IJ book and sadly I would not recommend it.  Countdown is very clearly a part 2 or part 3 of something she wrote previously.    The first part of the book is full of people showing up with no character development at all.  At first I thought it was just really poor writing, but then it dawned on me, this is a part 2 of some story started previously.  As I continued reading, the vast majority of the story flashes back to previous events, characters, conflicts and plots from part 1, whatever that was.   I think IJ owed it to her readers to mention this as a continuation.  It would be a huge help for new IJ readers (like me) so we could read part 1 first.   Then again, maybe the lack of character and plot development is typical for IJ.  Countdown was supposed to be about a bomb plot, yet 2/3's of the way through the book the bomb has received only a sentence or two of coverage and across the entire 500+ pages, it warrants less than a full page or two of mention.  Countdown is more of a romance/love story than the thriller it is marketed as.  If you go into it expecting a romance, you'll probably enjoy it.  If you're looking for a thriller, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for an ending, look elsewhere. 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 It must be class notes from a class he taught; it was far too muddled to be a stand alone text.  There also times where I felt he was encouraging us that we all must think, but we are all to come to the same conclusion 
 I ordered this DVD not realizing it was not the Disney feature.  Since I had already opened the packaging I figured I'd check it out.  I found this to be a very basic, boring and not a very entertaining version of the timeless tale. The animation is dull and appears washed out.  The story lacks the adventure and excitement I felt necessary to entertain my young kids (even my six-year-old fell asleep).  If you're in the market for the Disney version of this movie be aware that this version is NOT DISNEY 
 The scary part of this book is that it is written by a very thoughful and balanced expert. And that is why it is scary. This is not the idiotic ramblings of a Rush Limbaugh or the easily dismissed vitriol coming out of big mouths like Bill O'Reilly. No, this is a very well-considered, well argued tome written by one who knows what he is talking about. It is like Albert Einstein arguing for the merits of nuclear destruction, complete with a precise scientific explanation of massive carnage at the sub-atomic level. Fortunately, Professor Einstein did just the opposite. Knowing what he knew, he forcefully argued against nuclear weapons, using his considerable knowledge to convince us all of the folly of nuclear war.  Judge Posner unfortunately uses his considerable knowledge of the law to argue for the skirting of basic rights guaranteed under our Constitution. But his entire logical edifice, no matter how erudite, is based on one fatally flawed premise - that somehow, our Constitution, based on fundamental rights is somehow incapable of dealing with barbarity. And somehow the current crop of terrorists are so special that they deserve to be put into a unique category that our founding fathers could never imagine.   It is very convenient to accuse present day civil libertarians of not being in touch with history as it is undoubtedly true that too many of us, products of a failed education system are not very well versed in history. But to accuse our founding fathers as historically naive is laughable. Just Jefferson's knowledge of history alone was more profound than the combined knowledge of our current Supreme Court. We were blessed by having a legal framework made up of men who were some of most brilliant minds of their day, and who were very much in touch with the human condition and all of its complexity. Compared with them, Judge Posner is but a speck of a thinker. 
 Thank you, Ladies, for writing this book. You are exactly why I will never marry an American woman and why I have advised my nephews and younger brother the same.  I was exhausted halfway through the thing. While I had dealt with my divorce, this book has kindled in me something I would never have expected concerning my divorce from the woman whose very breath I loved. That something is nothing less than ecstatic joy at being free from being tied to an American woman.  Hard, driven, cold, lacking natural affection for their own children, often focused on proving they are as sexually active as a man would like to be, LOL, as if that is a good thing these women portray the American woman as totally devoid of affection or morals.  Don't worry ladies about committment, no one would want you for more than an evening's distraction anyway. 
 First, the reason for one star is a reminder to leave Pinter's plays to others.  I read the "The Birthday Party," and, "The Room," and may or may not read the rest of the plays.  Informatively I am an avid reader with a vast collection.  The Birthday Party and The Room did not have one redeeming feature. I could not believe that anything written could be so bad.  In my opinion both were absolute garbage and I wonder how and why in the first place it was every published. When I finished reading this nonsense a thought came to mind as follows: If a monkey was placed by a computer keyboard and was allowed to   go crazy hitting the keys, the result would probably be, "The Birthday Party and The Room.  Since I was punished enough reading the above, reading the rest of the plays would only compound my bewilderment and disappointment in choosing this book.  If this book was offered to a publisher by a writer other than Harold Pinter and the editor read the first two plays, if he read that far, which I doubt, he would have thrown the book in his waste basket followed by an oath.  Unfortunately, I purchased a couple of the Pinter Books from Amazon.com and will check them out only because I purchased them   and am curious to learn if they are as bad a read as the one I reviewed.

 a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film.  its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect?  there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here. 
 This book is more about bagels, than actually about MAKING bagels. I would recommend Joan Nathan's "Jewish Cooking In America" for a book that has a better recipe for bagels as well as SO much more to offer (heck, even if you are only looking for the bagel recipe her book is still a better way to spend your money) 
 Most of the t-shirt designs in this book are just plain bizarre...  A lot of large holes cut out of the t-shirt or jagged edges cut through it.  Not something I would ever, ever wear (ok, I would maybe wear three of the 99, honestly...).  A previous reviewer had it right when she commented the designs are made for skinny women who like to show off.  This targeted demographic isn't a problem, but this is definitely not a book for every woman, and (if I had children) I wouldn't give it to my daughters as inspiration for art projects.  Also, there are zero actual pictures in the book and relatively little instruction.  There is one color drawing of each design (so of course it looks great) and a cursory explanation of how it was created.  I think this book might be more appropriate for someone who has some creative sewing juices but needs a little extra help thinking of unique designs to create and someone who is not afraid to show off 
 First of all, the battery that was supposed to be enclosed was not. When I bought a 9 volt battery and installed it, it would not stay attached when putting it back in the battery compartment. Finally, I got a read out, and entered my height and age. Then I stood on the scale and got nothing - no weight, no body fat, nothing, but the word ERROR, at which point I boxed it up and sent it back for a refund 
 I truly like military action novels, so I was let down by this book.  I found the opening scenes, with an exercise being conducted in the middle of a massive hurricane to be somewhat unbelievable to say the least.  While I do know that risking ships and personnel during wartime is part of the deal, risking ships and the same people for an exercise, and one that is essentially a "bet" between the French and American presidents is ludicris.  I also found the paranormal nonsense to be just that, nonsense.  It greatly detracted from the storyline, and that plot was telegraphed ahead of time so blatantly that I pretty much had the book figured out from about page 50 or so.  The gratuitous sex scene was totally unecessary to the book, and seemed to be there just to "fill a square" in the accepted novel formula.  It seemed to me that this book was just a reason to let the reading public know about Mr. DiMercurio's divorce.  While I'm not doubting the seriousness of that situation, I question his using my money to exorcise his personal demons.  A waste of money 
 as usual, michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours. theres alot of great stuff here (the interview w marilyn manson, the interview w trey parker, &c), but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling, no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston. i agree with many, nay most of moores politics -- but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution. 
 A pitiful extended bore...how many times do you have to see the intrepid pilots fly up the fjord practice run to get the picture.  This one ought to be coupled with "The revenge of the Killer Tomatoes"....save your dough from this turkey 
 To echo one of the other reviewers, exact placement of the wrist rest is near impossible.  Two days after I thought I had done it perfectly, a bubble appeared.  I tried pressing it out, but within a matter of hours the bubble back.  So, I decided to remove the wrist rest. To my disgust, the adhesive had (in the space of a few days!) begin to cling tighter to my laptop than the pad.  It took me about hour to get the last of the gummy adhesive off.  Avoid the wrist rest 
 This book tells you nothing that the U.C.C., Restatement 2nd, and a basic cases and examples book (Farnsworth, for instance) doesn't already tell you.  This hornbook, however, is much denser and dryer than these other texts.  Surely there must be better study texts out there than this for the first-year Contracts student.  To give you a taste of this literary castor oil, the first chapter asks the question, "What is a contract?"  Then it proceeds for paragraphs upon dense paragraphs about what some obscure academic once said a contract is.  Then C&P say that they don't like that explanation (without really explaining why very well).  This is repeated over and over again.  Then they conclude by saying, Golly gee, we'll be darned, but we really don't know what one of them contract thingies is, but we'll talk about them in the most boring way possible for the next several hundred pages using as many words as we possibly can in order to justify our royalties.  Later, the book covers history of contracts, and the concepts of debt, assumpsit, and covenant, but in a very dense and dry manner lacking in well-communicated insight (again, Farnsworth's casebook, for example, is much more direct and enlightening).  This is par for the course with C&P.  If you really want to understand Contract law better, just review various sections of the Restatement 2nd of Contracts, and the comments thereto.  That is a shorter and more direct read, and depending upon your law school, you probably have to know what the Restatement 2nd says anyway.  May as well get it straight from the horse's mouth instead of reading some law geeks overpostulate on it 
 ...if you're truly interested in the subject of public intellectualism.  This is the man who, in "Breaking the Deadlock," excused the conduct of the Bush king-makers in the Florida executive branch (Katharine Harris and Jeb Bush foremost among them), and argued that the Supremes were justifiable in their disregard for the common law tradition.  He is someone whose mouth is securely fixed to the public teat, and having "affirmed" what he sees as just conduct in the 2000 election - which brought to power the most anti-intellectual, anti-democratic administration in the nation's history - his opinions in any discussion of public discourse are highly suspect 
 Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely 
 Maybe i'm not as cultured as some of the people who rated this book, but i have read the likes of Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott and i think it is safe for this to be a true review. Please, please don't put yourself through the torment of reading this book, it is probably the worst book i have ever read. It goes on and on about the littlest of details which don't have anything to do with the book. I read this when i was 11 and it is safe to say i wasn't too immature to read it. Everyone in my class read it and i'm pretty sure we all had the same opinions, it really sucked. I would tell you the worst part of the book, but that would ruin the story. But let me just tell you a little tip, don't read it. Don't read it, don't read it, don't read it. I tried to read it again last year and i couldn't put myself through the pain and torment of reading the worlds worst book. Don't waste your money or waste a part of your life reading a book about nothing 
 i had this book to read for a class at james madison university and if your living and breathing...don't read this book. it was dry and didn't grab my attention at all.if you want facts, then this is the book for you.if you want good reading,pick another book 
 The example letters are uniformly dreadful.  Marginal grammar and usage combine with a sacherine style aimed at kissing up to second-raters.  These letters are guaranteed to repell anyone with whom one would really like to work 
 I am not afraid to look the reality of colorism in the eye and acknowledge that it does exist within the black community. It is my greatest hope and dream that someday the dark skinned black and the light skinned black will be seen as the one family in the future. I want so much to love the lightskinned sister and brother as my own reflection and not be divided from them or made to feel that one is treated better than the other, but sadly, that day is not here and this book bravely and powerfully illustrates that point to the fullest.   I am a medium brown colored woman, my mother was very dark skinned and I have witnessed the evils of skin color prejudice all my life. In most situations, it was Black Men who were prejudiced against myself and the women around me beccause of our coloring. These men felt no shame or limit in their racist intra-family prejudice and measured their entire lives by how many light skinned or white women they could attain and how light brite their children could come out. It's everywhere and anyone who denies it is both a fool and a liar.   That is why I highly recommend THE BLACKER THE BERRY by Wallace Thurman. There is no truer portrait of the self-hatred among our people than the one extolled in this book, and what makes it even sadder is that this book was written in the 1920's. So that only shows how deep this kind of evil runs.   Lately, I have become very interested in this subject and I have searched for other books that explore this subject with intelligence, honest, beauty and wisdom and I have found several that I consider to be classics on the subject of Colorism.   (1) MARITA GOLDEN'S book "Don't Play In the Sun" is definitely the most modern up to date book of the bunch. It expertly weaves the story of her life experiences in the 1960's Black Power movement with the current struggles of women like Serena Williams and India Arie to find their way in the world, even in the midst of being shunned and ignored by the black community itself. The book's analysis of the Hollywood casting system and the "Mulatto Follies" of BET and MTV is priceless.   (2) "The Bluest Eye" by TONI MORRISON is by far the most riveting and painful book that I have read on this subject of colorism. I believe that her book, more than any mother, gets to the psychological and historical root cause of the problem and exposes the mode in which we pass the problem on generation to generation. The destruction of an innocent black girl named Pecola Breedlove will leave you heartbroken and shocked as you see the bold naked truth unfold right before your eyes. You can't ignore this book, because the story being told is the one that you are all too familiar with no matter what color you are.   (3) "Flesh and the Devil" by African novelist KOLA BOOF is another deeply powerful book that examines colorism, but not out in the open. This book is unique in that it focuses on a very enchanting love story between a Black Prince and Princess and follows their reincarnations through history as they struggle to find their way back to each other. Through detailed moments in black history, both in Africa and the United States, the provocative author highlights the way that black people originally viewed their beauty and humanity and then juxtuposes it against the way they see themselves now in the modern world. The result is nothing less than devastating. I love this book so much, because the storytelling is so rich and the depth is so sweeping and grand. Anyone who loves good writing and is proud to be descended from the Black race will find themselves literally changed forever by the powerful images depicted in this very poetically moving story.   (4) "The Color Complex"--VARIOUS AUTHORS, is a very simple, straight forward analysis from a sociological point of view. Much research and statistical facts are used to illustrate that our communities are infested with these issues.   (5) "The Darkest Child" by Dolores Philips is another great novel that shows us the poor blacks who live under the poverty line ingesting these complex social hierarchies based on color and how they not only expose their children to them, but force the entire community to live by the "color code". Everybody is used to it from slavery and the system goes on and on unchallenged. In this book, Tangy Mae, the darkest of 10 children by the white-looking mother Rozelle, struggles to find her dignity and confidence in the midst of her evil light skinned mother inflicting one horrid abuse on top of the other. One thing I will say for the evil white-looking mother, Rozelle, is that she treated all of her children hiddeously and with contempt, from the whitest to the blackest. But she killed the child who was born looking like Tangy Mae and that spoke volumnes. This book is a very real metaphor for what goes on. Very real.   
 This book provided some good information and presented some of the stodgy content of the PMBOK in a matter-of-fact approach.  I would not rely on this book, however, as it delves into a lot of material not covered on the exam.  If you get caught up in the complex formulas in the CAPM guide, you are likely to miss the key 4 or 5 formulas that the CAPM exam actually covers.  I passed the exam, although I relied principally on the PMBOK.  For an entry-level exam such as the CAPM, the PMBOK is really all you need.  For those with little to no PM experience, a couple of supplemental readings such as this one may be helpful.  Good luck!  
 Per the description, it sounded like these would fit snug.  Well, they fit too snug, feeling very cramped. I have a 33 inch waist, and ordered the 32/34 waist.   I'm used to boxer briefs made from cotton.  This was the first time that I've got polyester boxer briefs.  Unless you like 'um really tight, you might want to go to the next size up, or just get cotton briefs.  I'm throwing these away

 The book tells us little about Shakespeare himself. Rather, it is a chronicle of Elizabethan times in England. We learn more about his contemporaries, e.g. Johnson, than we do about Shakespeare. There is even more information in the book that touches on the physical layout of the Globe Theater than the playwrite. The book is, however, a fairly concise, yet informative listing of his plays 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 For starters, if you want to start saving money then don't buy this book or waste the gas to get you to the library!  By far the WORST wedding book I have ever read (and I've read lots of them).  This book has hideous reception suggestions such as using your parish CAFETERIA to host your event.  Using olives as an "appetizer", having a fake foam cake, having an amatuer dj who plays "for free to get experience" and many other bad ideas. Words cannot express how bad I thought this book was.  I actually called another woman and read her a few quotes to get her opinion and she laughed so hard she actually cried.  The fact that the author kept plugging her other stupid wedding planning books was almost as tacky as some of her suggestions. Right up there with the tackiness of a cash bar.   
 Im a quite advenced web developer, i bought the book for discipline, you know, one have to read different opinions, but this was a bad time spending to buy it, espect it and reading it.  Too much pre-self-appologies and redundant talking at the begining of the book, those 'predictions' about when will be possible to read long texts on line... completely out of place.  Writing is disorganized, plenty of drifting away from the subject. I guess that Jakob Nielsen is a grat web developer, he knows many technical things about it, but he should not write books. Or he might take some lessons about "making some text shorter", -if you can say somthing using two words, don't use three. Usability is just about to make things easy to read and understand with minimum effort, this short-lettered, plenty-of-words-pages and plenty of pages book is exactly to learn things you should not do when trying to reach for usability.  Im sorry Mr. Nielsen, its dissappointing 
 I no longer work for  Hill & Blume   Surveyors,   Sydney (!!!!!). 
      How in the world do I handle this? To be fair, I am well aware that bands release "Greatest Hits" compilations all the time. To me, that's what this is... Midnight Syndicate's Greatest Hits essentially. Unfortunately, it can't really even be called a Greatest Hits CD. Why? It doesn't include the 'best' tracks from all of the Midnight Syndicate CDs, but only from the first three, none of which are currently in print.  I will not sit here and write that it's "terrible" music. It's not, by any means. However, I am not anywhere near as big a fan of this duo as I used to be. They were among my first tastes of this type of music, and it certainly has been an interesting experience, but I feel that I've moved on. I have since found  others who perform Gothic horror music that is much better and more enticing...  and just far more exciting to me on many levels.       Why two stars? It's just the way I feel. Nearly everything that is on this compilation is already available to anyone who owns the original CDs of "Born Of The Night" and "Realm Of Shadows", which I do. Yes, again I know this is Midnight Syndicate's Greatest Hits, but to my ears for the most part the new mixes of these  tracks seem...quieter. They sound... softer, almost muffled and far away, as if drifting towards me from a fair distance but not quite reaching me. Also, the slightly different flavor in the arrangements.... well it's novel to hear the tracks done this way,  but they don't impress me all that much, and in most cases the tracks are "hurt" by the new flavors. For instance,  just as one example, "Darkness Descends" originally had a harp in it that I loved. That is gone, replaced with a piano. Lamentably, many tracks suffer the same fate, being hindered by the changes in flavor rather than helped, and losing the feel made me like the original tracks in the first place. I could go on and on about how I feel the revised tracks have suffered individually, but I don't want this review to become a novel.       As for the new material, there are four pieces here which would be considered new or previously unreleased. They are, respectively, "Scenes From The Dead Matter," "Prisoner Of Time" "Theme To Journey Into Dementia" and the previously recorded "Druids" from the first Midnight Syndicate CD released in 1997. The first three were at best mildly interesting at first because I had not heard them before, but they just did not grab me or get me emotionally 'involved' in the pieces.  They lost my interest just as quickly as they had gained my curious attention.  The last, ("Druids"), to my ears sounded almost exactly the same as the original recording, and suffered for it in my humble judgement.        I'm really trying to be fair. This honestly is not "horrible" music. As I said, many bands release Greatest Hits compilations and I know that. It wouldn't be fair of me to say that Midnight Syndicate shouldn't do that also ,  but part of me wishes they hadn't.  I  cannot bring myself to like this CD. I'm sorry, but I have to be honest and true to my own consciense. The new material does not involve me emotionally, and the revisions of the previously released tracks sound... tampered with in ways that hurt them, rather than being improvements. For those who have Born Of The Night and Realm Of Shadows already, there is no real reason to get this.       My heart is actually heavy  as I close this review. This CD might be  something that someone who has never heard Midnight Syndicate before might like to pick up, but I honestly wish it had never been made. It feels completely unnecesary. The recordings of the original Born Of The Night and Realm Of Shadows CDs were fine as they stood. They sounded better to me, and more importantly,in terms of emotion, they "felt" better and more compelling to listen to. This feels like a re-treading of old ground, where a "power" once had wihin the music has been lost. The newer material is okay, but it (very sadly in my view) adds nothing to the collection in terms of being compelling to hear.       I don't feel "betrayed" or "angered" by this release, as much as I feel, just... saddened by it all. I feel disappointed and let down. Thank you gentlemen, for an interesting experience...but I've moved on to bigger and better things. It was a fun journey while it lasted, but for me at least, it's over. Midnight Syndicate was good and I liked them very much for a time, but again, I've moved on. I have found composers of Gothic horror  music whose work I prefer much more.  I see no reason in my mind to not tell how I feel, and to speak what is, in my own heart, the truth 
 Roche's translations of Euripides' tragedies are intrusive.  He adds stage directions and characterizations that influence how the reader views the people in the plays.  Readers may believe that these stage directions are from Euripides, but most of them are not.  I find it irksome having to differentiate between Roche's interpretation of character and Euripides' text 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 July 31st 2005: I was looking for a DVD player for my bedroom at Costco and couldn't resist the $179 price for this brand new Philips HTS3400 (HTS3410 is the same except that it comes all in silver rather than silver/black).  I played some DVDs and CDs and after 2 days i decided to return it for 2 reasons: 1. It makes a hissing sound when it's turned off. Now, it wouldn't bother me too much in a basement (althought it would still be anoying), but it's a definite NO NO in the bedroom. 2. Rear speakers are almost silent no matter how much you increase the volume to them.  If you don't mind these 2 things, then by all means go for it.  Aug 2005 UPDATE: Having nothing better to do, I went and purchased another unit from Costco to see if indeed I have a bad unit or it's a design/manufacturing issue. Surprise surprise...second unit makes the same exact noise only a bit louder! Curious enough (i'm a mechanical engineer with some knowledge of electronics) i open the unit to see where is this noise coming from. It is the AC/DC transformer, more specific two 330uF capacitors making this noise. That is really poor design and/or low quality components!!! I did not expect this from a brand name like Philips. This is no different than any no name units out there at half price.  As a result I am changing my initial reivew and recommend that you look for a different product, this one is definately not worth the money. I cannot update the stars but this time I would rate it with 0 stars.  Oct 2006 Update: It stopped reading CDs but it reads DVDs no problem. Returned to Costco! 
 I really liked Boyd's first book - smart, passionate, opinionated and well-paced.   Since then, the bar has certainly been raised on TS lit - Chris Beam's Transparent is the new cool - and, alas, Boyd has lost her edge. Most of this book reflects Boyd's time on the seminar and publicity circuit - it's much more circumspect and diplomatic than My Husband Betty; no more dissing Tri-Ess, for example, and that's a shame because Boyd was at her best when she built up some heat. Also, a lot of this book reads as if her lectures have been compiled, then padded to book-length. There's a lot of lazy writing - cliches like "king's ransom," "necessity is the mother of invention," "love is a many-gendered thing," and so forth, everywhere. Sigh. I was really looking forward to this, but it's a flat read.  Betty DOES look ravishing on the cover, though 
 i cannot get thru this one.  i started fast-forwarding but there didn't appear to have any good spots.  when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this, i thought, this has to be good.  i had just finished a movie where he starred.  can't remember the name of it.  i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it.  tori spelling is well known, but not to me.  someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start.  she does not play a flake very well, and i don't know what to call her except a flake.  i stopped this dvd in about the first 1/2 hour and will go back and give it another shot, but with tori spelling as one of the leads, i already know this one does not have a prayer.  i would say; save your money on this one unless you are under 13.  i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that don't.  this one falls into this category. one that came with this one was "the broken hearts club" and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage.   
 The thing that Hewitt wants most is to lead this country down the path of fascism. Don't join him. Would recommend staying away from these people. Read something intelligent like Chomsky. 
 I'll be honest, I haven't finished it yet.  I've read 3 other books in the week since I started it since it is so boring.  I would not buy it again, recommend it or even start it if I saw it.  I'll probably finish it as a  point of honor, but stick to the author's other works 
 While the premise of this book is intriguing the delivery was disappointing at best. The analogies between golf and business were  trite and not very illustrative.  Good analogies between golf and business process analysis do exist, such as the way that statistical analysis and feedback loops are used by pros to reduce variation in shot accuracy and eliminate wasted motion in their swings. "Shots into bunkers represent waste" is about as sophisticated as this book gets.    
 "Lysistrata" is truly a revolting play that pokes fun at women.  They say Aristophanes thought women to be more than toys for their men, but I see the opposite.  I think Aristophanes made a satire out of women and the only thing they are good at: sex and reproducing male babies.  This is no compliment. To think that the only way women can change their husband's minds would be by withholding intercourse.  This is preposterous! I found this play derogatory with ill humor.  I do not recommend 
 This was a book that was better not written, or at least not published. As Woody Allen once coined a phrase, the book is, "a miasma of asinine cliches unrivaled in Western Literature." Why should any self-respecting individual want to read yet another paltry story of excusess as to why a drug addict became a drug addict ( and who seems to have a somewhat sardonic pride in his past addiction.)Being a Kennedy is not worth a plug nickle--and as this Kennedy shows--it sure dosen't make you smart.     
 If you've seen Tortilla Soup, there is no need to watch this movie.  This is just the Chinese version of the said movie.  The similarities of these 2 movies are so prominent that it would actually be a waste of time and money to buy both - same characters, same plot only in a different setting. I got to enjoy the scenes with food, though... 
 I bought this audio CD on the strength of my enjoyment of this woman's husband's books, which I keep in my library and re-read occasionally-the "Emotional Intelligence" series. This was a mistake; it's not at all like her husband's books. First of all, you really have to be into Buddhist philosphy and compassionate observation. If that's not your bag, you might not be happy with this purchase. Second, I found some of the examples of her patients to be a bit tortured. For instance, one patient has a breakthrough by recalling something from when she was an infant! Which seems hard to be believe....Finally, I think it was a mistake for the author to read the book. Her voice is okay, but she speaks incredibly slowly. I listen to a lot of audio CDs, and this is the slowest reading I have ever heard. I realize that if we are stressing soothing and zen, we might not want a rapid fire pace, but this goes too far 
   Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM's unhealthy cost structure. The  company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the  primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and  how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore  is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
 I couldn't get past the first 20 pages.  I flipped through the rest and the same pompous writing style persisted.  The author writes in eloquent words and sentences that make me want to fall asleep.  His flowerly language and verbosity is a sign of a poor writer who wants to seem talented.  Total waste of time and money.  Amazon, could I have a refund 
 I would not recommend this book for people who are trying to get their life together after a diagnosis of diabetes. I bought this book because its subtitle is "A Complete Guide to Planning, Shopping, Cooking, and Eating". It is none of those things.  I was particularly interested in the SHOPPING promise because I find that to be the most difficult part of managing my diet. Other books didn't have anything helpful, and despite its promise, this book doesn't either. One has to read through every single recipe, write down the ingredients of what you want to make, and then go out and get it. Just like every other book. So tell me: how does this help with "shopping"? I expected lists of basic staples in a diabetic's diet. There should be lists of "must-haves" for your pantry. This book lies about what it contains, and is sadly lacking in what it needs.  An expensive mistake, don't buy it 
 This format and the content of this book are tedious and unentertaining. Every single money saving tip in here can be obtained from internet frugal sites for free. And on top of that, the recipes are ridiculous. Not only are they not family friendly, you could blow your entire food budget for the week purchasing the speciality items to make just one of the meals. Want to feed your kids Sea Scallops, Pheasant and Prosciutto wrapped asparagus on the cheap? Well then you might buy this book? But if you want to cook these things on a regular basis anyway there are much better recipes and cookbooks out there for gourmet meals such as this so you've pretty much wasted your money anyway you go with this book. 
 I had recently read "How the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in It" and since I have a fondness for Scotland and its people I purchased the current volume. The book is very short and the writing is a bit disjointed.  While many Scottish Englightenment ideas are addressed in the book, the connection to the American founding fathers is not always direct.  In such a short book, that lack of attention to the title is distracting.  It is a however a quick read and not completely wihtout merit if you are not looking to devote yourself to a heavy tome.   
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 Fox's commentary paints Hildegard as a rather mushy New Age spiritualist.  (Which she was NOT!) The book's only redeeming quality is it's large, full-color reproductions of her illuminated manuscripts 
 It took a long time before any action to acumulate in Larry Watson's novel. I resented spending two hours of my time reading this book beacuse the novel could have conveyed the same message in 50 pages. I felt the writing was very simplistic contrary to other novels on family relationships and moral dilemas. A very easy read, avoid if possible 
 I have never felt that I could participate well in guided visualizations.  That is exactly what this CD is.  If you visualize well and can imgaine well and summon raw emotions at someone else's mere suggestion, this may work well for you.  But it doesn't for me.  It just feels silly and like a waste of my time and money.  This is not my modality.  
 What a great idea for a book. Three runners from different backgrounds and countries each competing to be the first man to run a four minute mile.  I really wanted to like this book more than I did.  After many, many pages detailing training, training, adn more training I began to skim in ernest. By the time the featured race was run, I was all out of steam.  I cannot put my finger on just what is wrong with the book other than it is really dry and boring.  Maybe if the author had gotten more into the personalities and less into the training regimens.  Anyway, somewhere they say it is "soon to be a major motion picture".  Mabye the movie will be better.  
 Leaving aside the painful and horrific real life incident that taints the movie for a moment, lets just look at the movie as it is. First off, I love horror movies, some of my faveorites even include ones that are considered "Bad" by tons of movie critics, like the first 4 'Friday the 13th' movies. I love most of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and the first 2 Halloween movies, and tons others, inlcuding, yes, Victor Salva's own 'Jeepers Creepers', whcih I think is the best horror movie to have come out in the last 5 years.     But Clownhouse is just laughable and annoying and terribly acted. The bickering among the 3 brothers was driving me nuts for one. The characters do so many amazingly stupid things that are cliches in horror movies, and they do them often, more so than in even the dumbest horror movies. Peple here have already noted the very cheesy music that takes away from whatever creepiness there is. The movie is just plain Boring.           The killings are all dull and lifeless. There just didnt seem to be any reason for this movie to exist, I mean its barely 80 minutes long! That is incredibly short for any movie, even a horror movie, which are usually around 90 minutes-plus or minus a few.          The movie is very lazy at explaining who the killers are, we get very little info about them, why they are mental patients, for one-What did they do? I mean what is their method of killing or why are they dangerous. Now that they are loose, what do they want? Money? Do they just wanna kill? Isn't it strange that they don't talk at all? SOme people have actually compared this to the greatest horror movie of them all, John Carpenter's Halloween, now thats a truley scary thought.       The movie was also incredibly predictable and took an incredibly long time to finally have the kids realize the killer clowns were in the house and gonna kill them, and even when the action finally starts, its all too unbeleivable and silly to beleive.          Unfortuneatley, I had a rather disturbing and sinister thought about why this "horror" movie, which almost doesnt even feel like a real horror movie to me, anyway, might have been made. Apparently, Victor Salva , the director had been molesting the young child star of the film, Nathan Forrest Winters, for years since he was age 7, they had previously worked on Victor Salva first film, a short film, some years earlier. Perhaps this whole movie making enterprise was endeavered just so Victor could have even more close proximity with the boy so he could molest him even more. Perhaps that is why Victor made the film. Its ironic that this movie is about evil clowns, because a clown is someone that usually makes kids happy, the kid actually has a line about why clowns are fake and shouldnt be trusted. Its all so weird, like was Victor trying to get himself caught? There is so much incriminating visuals and dialogue in this film that just doesnt belong in a horror movie, but well brings to mind kiddie porn. Apparently Victor was also a friend of the kids family for years. This movie is almost like Victor was bragging about his molestation of the boy, using his camera and storytelling skills to shove in everyone's faces his relationship with the boy. \          There is some strange back story in the film that is never really explained that alludes to mental illness, that the boy may have been suicidal and tried to off himself by cutting his hand or perhaps wrist. Its said he has "scars" there. Also that the boy may have been committed, just like the escaped killer clowns? Is Salva drawing a parallel there? Why does the child wet the bed at such an advanced age, Whats his problem anyway? Its never said, but perhaps Salva is hinting that hes gay, who knows. Its interesting that the killers dont just escape out of jail, they excape from a mental facility perhaps they are really just sick individuals, just like the boy ? Is Victor Salva trying to say he and the boy actor in the film both share something that others may say is sick but that they belong together? They say that child molestors search out young boys who they think are homosexual, who are one of them. The clowns are drawn to the boy, yet its also always the boy who see them, almost like hes looking for them like they are both drawn to each other.          I dont know why this film was made, so if my theories rub some here the wrong way, I am sorry, I just cant figure out why someone who would show talent in later horror movies like Jeepers Creepers, would make such a pointless awful and strange horror movie, if not for his own perverted pleasure. Definitely miss this flick, and dont be fooled by all the surprisingly positive reviews here. This movie sucks 
 "Compassionate Conservatism" by Olasky is a manifesto for a "bread-and-circus" ideology that grows more transparent by the day. Not surprisingly, it is heavy on rhetoric and light on substance.  The alliterative title is catchy, but "Bible-and-Business Conservatism" is more descriptive 
 The field of vision is too small for any useful viewing.  If you already know where your object is in the dark, then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark.  But if you are searching for an object in the dark, the small field of vision makes the search useless.    Also, there is too much "noise" in the image, thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing.  The IR makes the field of vision even smaller.    Overall I did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing.    By the way, if you own a camcorder with night-view, you already know how how the objects look in the dark.  You can use your camcorder's night view feature instead of buying this expensive devic 
 If you're searching for a CCNA study guide, I'd advise looking elsewhere.  While reading, I've noticed many typographical errors, poor editing, and in one case, an entire paragraph repeated for no apparent reason... and I'm only up to chapter five.  Many of the explanations are difficult to understand at best.  I frequently find myself searching other resources while trying to make sense of the incomplete and often confusing material.  If you must get this guide, wait for the sixth edition.  Hopefully, it will have gone through a more thorough proofing process 
 In this novel, Ha Jin writes like a Chinese Michel Houllebecq- the language is simple and direct, and the ultimate outlook for humanity is grim. The protagonist is also a shy young male on the outer rim of the mainstream community.  Like a lot of the modern Chinese fiction, the novel is preoccupied with the psychological damage inflicted by China's Communist years, and the paranoia and self-censorship that occurs to this day. The year is 1989, and the narrator's teacher, Wang, has just had a severe stroke. The narrator, Jian, is studying for the PhD candidacy exams; he is a student of classical Chinese poetry and hopes to be granted a PhD so that he can move to Beijing to live with his fiancee Meimei, who is his teacher's daughter.  Wang's stroke has left him raving and mad. Jian is assigned by the university secretary to care for Wang while he is in hospital. During Jian's afternoons spent in the hospital room, he is audience to his teacher's ravings, which begin to reveal all sorts of disturbing truths that had managed to stay hidden until that point.  The story is set against the backdrop of the student activism leading up to the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Toward the end of the novel, Jian becomes so disillusioned by his teacher's revelations that he decides to forfeit the PhD exams, resulting in Meimei's breaking up with him. Aimless, he travels to Beijing and takes part briefly in the student demonstrations. Amid the violence, he is lucky enough to find his way back to the train station to return to his university in Shanning. Upon return he is informed that he is about to be taken away for his role in the Beijing demonstrations, and the novel ends with him on the run, having been forced by circumstances to abandon his belongings, his friends, and his identity.  The stark language with which the ending is rendered makes it all the more appalling. The matter-of-factness with which Jian takes the steps to erase himself from his previous life suggests the ordinariness of his actions in such extraordinary times. 
 It is very interesting to get an insight into a life of a single black man around the turn of the century.  But it sure was boring to read.  I you are interested in the topic, read it - but make sure you have a pillow near by becuase you will be snoring 
 Harlen Coben is an fabulous writer and I usually adore listening to his books on CD. But Promise Me was a difficult listen because of the reader. When I checked to see who the reader was, it was Coben himself! Coben should stick to writing and have his books read by actors 
 What a painfully boring book!  I was really looking forward to reading this book, as I normally love biographies and had heard some interesting things about Gellhorn.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be soooo boring!  What a waste of my money.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did 
 but this one isnt all that bad, it has rarities in it. "emotion" by samantha sang is one of them. She vanished after that effort (which was produced by the BeeGees) but what a hit it was. I guess if you are going to soak the money into the complete series, you need this volume 
 I bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it. I have a Mac Pro running the latest version of Mac OS. I installed it and it needs to run on 800x600 resolution, which is kind of silly in this day-and-age, but that works OK. What does not work is that it crashes about every 5 minutes. Pretty unworkable. Don't bother buying this for a Mac 
 I am an MBA student-this was one of the worst textbooks I think I have ever had the misfortune to use. It was riddled with errors, which took me an hour to transcribe from the publisher's website. My entire class was confused by the end of chapter questions, which in some chapters seemed to have no connection to what was taught in the chapter. I and everyone else in my class wondered all along the way if we could trust what we were reading as being accurate. Stay away from this if you value your time and your sanity 
 Although this book didn't really live up to expectations, I will at least say it provided an entertaining read.  If you're already familiar with contemporary sci-fi you won't find too many new ideas here.  A lot of the ground in this book has already been covered in works like "The Diamond Age" (Neal Stephenson - nanotech opus), "Neuromancer" (William Gibson - disembodied ID shifting), "Ender's Game" (Orson Scott Card - automated education) or "The Transmigration of Timothy Archer" (Phillip K. Dick - tricked out humans).  Of course the main difference here is that Mr. Kurzweil is not a sci-fi author but a proven inventor and entrepeneur.  He acknowledges the 'speculative non-fiction' aspects of the book but at times gets carried away with his predictions and occasionally sounds like a hokey traveling salesman.  Throughout the book he claims some degree of expertise in such broad ranging interests as nanotechnology, neurology, interactive entertainment, visual arts, biology, anthropology, philosophy, ethics and sexuality.  Granted the material draws on many of these disciplines but his arguments often come to conclusions that simply have no scientific basis.  This book, published in 1999 suggested that our brains will be "scanned" in the near future.  The concept sounds very Ghost-In-The-Shell and has about as much plausibility as a typical Japanese animation.  An article appearing in the October 2004 issue of Discover asked the question, "Will anyone ever decode the human brain"? The author, much less optimistic than Kurweil noted that "No conceivable technology will be subtle enough to discern all the memories, emotions, and meanings aroused in us by our perceptions."  He made this assumption based on the fleeting nature of the actual neurons in your brain that change and evolve rapidly every day.  To equate this mush with bits and bytes, jpegs and mp3's, is a little naive and ridiculously optimistic.  Hopefully it will happen someday, maybe even in our lifetime.  Until then though, you'd be better off reading real fiction...  This book's (almost) saving grace is Kurzweil himself.  He's obviously having fun writing this book and presumably hopes to raise some eyebrows.  Even when that comes off as legacy-building ("Remember - you read that here first!") it's oddly charming.  Inserting himself into a dialogue with his fictitious creation "Molly" is at first obnoxious, condescending even, but by the end it's actually pretty amusing.    That said, if you're holding out for some deep insight as to what a "spiritual machine" might be, I'll save you the trouble by telling you that the author's angle (in the two pages it's mentioned) is that spirituality basically boils down to biological phenomena.  Sorry, that it.  Apparently that was good enough for Mr. Data so it's also good enough Mr. Kurzweil.  Computers will one day magically start loving - once they're smart enough of course.  In the mean time, we can gloss over the fact that subjective AI is still a non entity in our world 
 Once upon a time I was given a vanity-published book to review. It was an illogical mess, full of breathtaking non-sequiturs. While reading "Iron John," I couldn't help thinking of it. The vanity book, however, was at least entertaining.  John Eldredge refers to "Iron John" liberally in his book "Wild at Heart," and because I considered that a ringing endorsement, I purchased a copy. I can't tell you what a chore it has been to finally finish reading it. The hardest part was not flinging it away in disgust about 17 times.  It's one thing to write a rambling tome full of obscure references; it's another to publish it. That people can slog through it and call it "profound" and "important" is baffling; what's even more mind-boggling is that people claim that this book "spoke" to them. I think it's a case of "I'd better say I understand it, or people will think I'm not erudite." Well, let me be erudite about it: "Iron John" is a big, steaming pile of New Age crapola. Don't say I didn't warn you 
 Trying out a moderate position that lets him have his conservative genius  Shakespeare in quotes and so eat it too, Bate has written a lifeless,  boring account of Shakespeare.  The prose is wooden.  The book is so  tedious I confess I didn't get through much of it 
 Professor Shaw is certainly not starved for thoroughness in presenting the rise and fall of the Ottoman state. But what this text boils down to is something that Herman Melville would have penned had he been a scholar in Turkish history. Piling on fact after fact after fact is not conducive to a worthwhile learning experience. You would need more than two hands to count how many times I flung this text against the wall, and I consider myself to be *very* patient. Luckily, there are alternatives available. Halil Inalcik does a much more lucid job--his book is the one to get 
 Ripping off King, but with more sex, shallower characters, and a Hollywood ending. Leave it on the shelf 
 This has got to be the absolutely the sickest bottom of the heap horror movie ever made. You have been warned 
 Julia Blackburn's biography of Billie Holiday is disappointing. She makes poor use of what appears to be excellent research by Linda Kuehl. Some of the interview material is fascinating, but it is poorly cobbled together.  It's small wonder that this book gets intolerant and hateful reviews like that of Desiree Troy (though I suspect this particular reviewer is very young and inexperienced, given their extremely naive perspective). You get very little sense from reading this book of why Billie Holiday's music is still important to people nearly fifty years after her death, and seventy years after her prime.  You cannot evaluate Billie Holiday just from reading this book, and in fact you probably shouldn't read it at all 
 The Murder Book is one in a long series featuring Alex Delaware, and only the second I've read, and most likely the last.  Kellerman does a good job characterizing Alex and gay friend Milo, but the plot is so full of contrivances and holes that it made this book very dissapointing.  The book opens with Alex receiving a book with pictures of crime scenes in it dating 20 to 40 years old.  Alex calls Milo over to look at it and Milo instantly recognizes one of the pictures in there.  It is of Janie Ingalls, a case he never solved.  Milo then recalls the case and the investigation with his partner Schwinn in flashback style.  Milo and Schwinn are pulled off the case just as they gather some clues and Milo has been bothered by it ever since.  Schwinn has a source who says the Ingalls girl may have been at a party thrown by a bunch of rich kids.  In the present day, Milo and Alex begin investingating the rich kids the Cossacks and their friends Michael Larner and Vance Coury.  It seems like for 200 pages they investigate the rich kids befor the dead Ingalls girl is mentioned again.  The link between the murder of the Ingalls girl and then the long drawn out investigation of the Cossacks and Larners and everything that stems from that is tenious at best.  The book kind of glances over this part at the beginning, indicating Schwinn had a source who said there was a wild party at a house owned by the Cossacks.  Alex and Milo believe Ingalls and her friend may have attended the party but have no proof or real reason to believe this.  My problem is that every step that Alex and Milo take in their investigation is circumstancial, not confirmed by any hard facts.  Milo and Alex do a lot of investigating, but none of their suspicions are ever confirmed by hard evidence.  The trail of crime from the Cossacks is so drawn out its hard to remember at times what the original investigation was.  Also, there is never really any contact with the bad guys at all in the book.  Then, the book ends with the horrible method of long explanation.  Milo talks with a man who basically explains everything to him about what really happened.  Milo knew some of it through his tedious investigations, but the rest is confirmed in the end.  I haven't read much of this series, so I don't know much about the Bert Harrison character.  But it seems to be far fetched that a fatherly figure to Alex could be the psychiatrist to so many main characters in this book.  It seems like a cheap plot device to hand Alex the answers he is looking for.  In the end I was very disappointed because Kellerman is obviously a good writer.  I just don't know what he was thinking when he threw this plot together. 
  How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: "How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man." (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.  Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, "If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose." The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: "This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities." How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  "Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man." (p. 147). He does not forget that this "education" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. "Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant." (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  "It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society." (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society. Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm: Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.   Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:  Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.  I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?  Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.     
 Having been a Glass fan since Music in 5 Parts and a R. Shankar fan for even longer, I eagerly anticipated this collaboration.  Individually, both Glass and Shankar challenged my listening in many directions.  When Passages finally arrived, it was a real disappointment. This work challenged only my patience and ability to stay awake.    Every two years or so I give it another listen to see if a new perspective emerges.  It doesn't 
 I have read half of Jodi Picoult's novels and this one was such a disappointment. I didn't care for any of the characters and just wanted to scream during the last 50 pages. I only finished it so I could find out what happened. After reading My Sister's Keeper, Vanishing Acts, and Picture Perfect (3 of the best novels I have ever read) this one was a huge let down. It felt very impersonal and boring 
 Stopped reading it halfway.  I just found the whole premise, and the author's attempt to create a dramatic context, half-baked.  This struck me as a book churned out in a hurry to meet some quota.  Save your money.. 
 I was so happy with the first DVD I played - then the second and every next DVD would not load.  The player has never left my kitchen table - no chance for abuse.  I sure hope I can return it - it was expensice 
 Because of its popularity and its subject matter, I was very excited to read Chalmers' The Conscious Mind. I was horribly disappointed.  First, Chalmers' discussion of supervenience and intension in chapter two is horribly convoluted. Of course, Chalmers asterisked some of the more technical parts of this chapter so that the lay reader could skip them, but here's the problem: if you skip these sections, you are no longer able to critique the most crucial parts of Chalmers's argument!   Second, Chalmers engages in bizarre and fallacious reasoning. One of his central arguments runs like this: It is possible to imagine a zombie---that is, a being who is molecule-by-molecule identical to me, but who lacks phenomenal conscious experiences (i.e., qualia). Since imagining this involves no obvious logical contradiction, zombies must be logically possible. Since zombies are logically possible, qualia must not supervene on physical facts--that is, qualia are not logically dependent upon the physical. Since this is true, there can be no possible reductive, materialistic explanation of consciousness.  This argument is preposterous on its face, as many reviewers have noted, and it is only the hocus-pocus about supervenience and intension in chapter two which lends it even a little credibility. For example, let's assume that reductive explanation X can fully explain consciousness in terms of brain functioning. Even if this is true, it is STILL possible for us to imagine zombies right NOW---purely because of our ignorance of X. Since the zombie argument is a central pillar of Chalmers's text, its failure is a failure of the book as a whole.  Third, Chalmers has not done his homework when it comes to the arguments of other philosophers. For example (leaving aside the technical details), I would suggest reading Quine's essay "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" in From a Logical Point of View. Then, read Chalmer's discussion of Quine's arguments in chapter two of this book. Then reread Quine's essay (it's a tough essay). Chalmers utterly fails to refute Quine's arguments, and these arguments are absolutely fatal to Chalmers's entire enterprise--especially his ridiculous zombie argument.  Finally, Chalmers does not address previous attempts to explain qualia (phenomenal conscious experiences) reductively. Daniel Dennett, for example, spends an entire chapter of Consciousness Explained trying to provide just such a reductive explanation. Since Chalmers's whole point is to argue that the existence of qualia specifically makes reductive explanations of consciousness impossible, his failure to spend even two pages on Dennett's explanation is ridiculous. (Briefly, Dennett argues that qualia just are the sum total of all a person's visceral, cognitive, emotional, etc. repsonses to a particular object of perception.)  In its foundations, its approach, and its failure to address important arguments by Quine, Dennnett, and others, this book is an abject failure. Instead, I would strongly suggest purchasing the wonderful and varied essay collection Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem.   
 This novel was a terrible disappointment for me because I have enjoyed almost all of Elizabeth Berg's previous novels.  This one, however, is so unrealistic, so phony and so easy to see where the story is leading.  An idyllic marriage, a perfect little town, ideal new neighbors and acquaintances,  friends who rush to the aid of the new widow even though she has ignored them for 30 years, and so on.  Too treacly by far! 
 I really started out liking this story.  Loved the New Orleans setting and the idea of ghost hunting combined with a possible hoodoo/voodoo connection.  But the character of Cree Black got on my nerves so bad that I found myself not caring much about her one way or the other.  She is supposed to be a 'brilliant' Ph.D in psychology, but she's an emotional train wreck who can hardly navigate her way through life.  Why anyone would pay her thousands to exorcise their ghosts is beyond me.  She's ineffectual, totally incapable of intimacy, lies compulsively to her friends and family, and seems stuck in this self-pity time warp over her husband who died 9 years ago!  Please!  
 What I have come to expect of Rhino is thoroughness, and this CD certainly is not thorough, although what is here is of course done very well. Where are the hits Half the Way,Why have you left the one you left me for, etc?  I think this could have been a great collection if made longer, or possibly even a two CD set, although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that......too bad, it remains a "couldve been great"..... 
 I've read most of Ludlum's so this one was a bit disappointing.  Too formulaic and downright lazy in parts.  The dialogue was sloppy.  One too many "oh my gods" made me think the characters were more wowed than I was. Aquitane Progression and the Bourne trilogy rules 
 I've heard Avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself.  I just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and BOTH link.  Not just a littler either but with every use.  My daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases.  I find this odd b/c the 6mths cups don't link at all. I think these products are very hit or miss. You may get a leaky cup or you they may work great. ? 
 Broke after only a few months of mild use.  Junk.  Save your money 
 When I purchased this item I got the impression that the kit (looking at the picture) included everything but the gazebo - which is the frame. You should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit. I need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it. The title of this item should say: "gazebo screen" and not "gazebo screen KIT"...    Unhappy custome

 My nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture.  Unfortunately, the inflatable suit is not really inflatable.  It requires constant air to keep it poofy looking.  It is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower (battery operated) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated.  The battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit.  Everytime he moves, it pops out.  The fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy, deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him.  He loves superman and loves having a cape.  He opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with.    I suppose we got what we paid for.  Cheap prices doesn't equate to quality.  I felt like my nephew got only a couple of minutes out of this toy.  Would not recommend it to anyone else... Unfortunately.. 
 I have never met anybody that has ear-holes big enough for these! I even tried SuperGlue to put the things that fit inside the ear! That didnt work, so now I have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound & talk sitting in the seat next to me. I would not reccomend these to anybody. Truth Hurts & these Hurt My Ears 
 Glib. While I feel for the suburban "lives of quiet desperation" angle, however shopworn, here it feels trite and slightly exploitative. Moody makes lists in lieu of description. Maybe this is a comment on the consumerism of the culture he's limning. But it comes off as lazy, as if he did a lot of research to come up with all these pop culture references and instead of integrating them just ticks them off. Even if he lived in that place and time he would have been younger than any of his characters. I was Wendy Hood's age in '73, living in a town next door to New Canaan, and I well remember that ice storm, when we were without power for a week, when a sofa caught fire in our house after using the fireplace non-stop for days. It's not that Moody gets the details wrong exactly, but they feel researched rather than lived, like the over-obvious production design of a mediocre movie. I don't remember key parties, I can't imagine my parents or their friends being remotely that adventurous. And the kids seem if anything a shade naive sexually. I came to the book long after the movie, which somehow did manage to get a lot of idiosyncratic details right. Little things like the mesmerizing patterns of the electrical wires along the train lines or white collar suburbanites using well worn trails to cut through the woods to  the neighbors'. The book was a disappointment 
 Thanks for pointing that out dullbot. I thought I was the only one who noticed Riddlebarger and his peers spend more time disproving "Strawman" theology that proving their own.  Anyone thinking of buying this book do your homework first by reading Riddlebarger's blog at kimriddlebarger.squarespace.com, you may find his thesis "Riddled" with errors 
 I could never understand why this album came out a year after Nothing Safe: The Best of the Box.  All the songs on this disc (except Heaven Beside You) are found on NSBOTB.  PLUS you get the AMAZING Get Born Again and 5 other songs not found on this CD.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Alice in Chains are possibly the greatest band of all time, don't get me wrong....I just don't think this measures up value-wise to the other possibilities 
 First book in the Mrs. Murphy series that I found boring.  Definitely not Ms. Brown's best.  Too much endless detail on wine making and too little concentration on characters 
 This is the 6th book in the series. I have read the first five, and enjoyed them all. I didn't care for this one as much as the others. The Author (Jannifer Chiaverini) has said that this was planned to be the last in the series. But she did very well with this book (high sales) and so the series continues past this.  However you can tell that she made some attempt to wrap-up some stories. What I didn't like about this book was that if felt VERY negative. Bad divorce... also very unbelieveable story about the wife being locked out of the condo... Bad real-estate development deal... Slimy and made you feel like you needed to take a shower and get clean after it.... NASTY neighbor who never learns her lesson, and is raising a mean-hateful son... Distruction of property with silly insurance problem... Hip, cool Mom who acts like in idiot when FULLY grown daughter moves in with boy-friend. Really... it went on and on. (Don't even get me started on the bad husband or the college chairmanship.) If I had it to do over again, I would read this series HOWEVER I would skip this one.  On the good side, nice to hear about the wedding quilt and what each person picked to express their feelings for Sylvia and Andrew 
 This book has its good points. If anything, it helps you put into words what you want  from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. The online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. This messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.  As for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees, I'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. The company I work for has done this, and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.  Your money can be spent better elsewhere. I say its only worth about $10 
 It's got some occasionally interesting puzzles, but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had.  The Good: Unique and challenging puzzles; handy hint system helps keep the game moving.  The Bad: Some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear; blurry, low-res backgrounds; dull characters and an uninteresting story 
 James Reichmann is a Jesuit in the pre-Vatican II sense.  At the time of the review, as well as when he wrote the book, he teaches philosophy at Seattle University (which is, of course, a Jesuit school).  He is set in his beliefs, and it shows in the text.  The text begins with a high-speed rundown of some of the big names in philosophy, briefly describing some of their work (spanning about 33 pages in all, out of roughly 270 pages).  The rest of the book focuses on Reichmann's own philosophy with little attention paid to possible criticisms.  The text is decidedly Christian in nature: Reichmann describes humans as creatures which are priviledged above all other animals, which he argues do not have the ability to learn, think, or communicate in any meaningful sense.  I think this book, and it's attitude in general, can be summed up with the following passages; I've included some commentary with some of the passages, so as to account for the rating I've given:  "The sobering conclusion emerging from the immense array of data gathered through the space explorations and the recent probes by astronomers into outer space is that life is, as far as we know, a unique earthly phenomenon." (246) [This is not a sound conclusion, nor an accurate representation of the facts: we've only explored the area of space local to earth.  As such, we cannot arrive at any "sobering conclusion" -- we must remain ambivolent to the possibility of life on other planets.]  "Lastly, the inadequacy of the evolutionary theory to account for the origin of the human was considered.  A brief account of the developments in the area of microbiology and anthropology was presented, and reasons why evolutionary theory is unable to explain the origin of the human were also given." (270) [He did, indeed, spend a lot of time arguing against evolution.  You may or may not believe in evolution, but hopefully you do believe that, when arguing against it, we should at least describe the theory accurately and attack it in its most defensive form.  Sadly, I think his description of the theory is not accurate to begin with, which undermines the credibility of his argument.  Straw man!]  "Recent developments in the areas of microbiology and anthropology are most consonant with a theistic view which assigns the origin and development of living things to a divine, creative act whereby nonliving matter is first organized and oriented toward a higher synthesis of a dynamically functional and creative unity." (272) [Even if you accept his arguments against evolution, he does not show how divine creation comes to the rescue.  Again, you may believe in creation, and that's fine, but for the sake of a textbook we should be a bit more rigorous: if we want to argue in favor of creation, we should explain why!]  If you hold these views, you will find in this book a voice which agrees with you and does not offer an alternative perspective; if you disagree with these views, you will probably feel as though he is misrepresenting the evidence and basing his arguments on straw men.  While this is good doctrine, I cannot say that it is in line with Jesuit standards of rigor, much less the philosophical practice of carefully constructing one's argument.  For this reason, I give the book 1 star 
 Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for 
 This book is not so much about intercultural relationships or movies. It is about pets, pet-obsession, abscesses, tumors, infections and revolting habits of said pets. Not two pages go on without at least a mention of the annoying creatures. The characters are all pretty stereotypical and their behavior is repetitive and predictable. A couple of interesting situations are stretched out incredibly thin. And the pets take on the scene again. Priceless: the "Dali" Lama typo. A big disappointment 
 Bob Mast was clearly involved in the progressive labor and civil rights struggle in the 70's or earlier in Detroit. His interviews with various others involved in the progressive struggle attempt to determine what went  right, what went wrong, and where are those people now 
 his idea was great for the book, alot of the stuff he says was well researched and correct, however, alot , especially when it gets to psychology , was outdated, and incorrect, and the book has alot of contradictions, once again, especially with the psychology parts, and his imprinting and mal-imprinting section contradicts things he says later on in the book, if you want to be better informed, skip this and go straight to actual psychology books , this is more or less a book for people who want to pretend to be intellectual, and just take anyones word on anything 
 Hands down this is Bukowski's single worst book.  Bought it when it first came out just before/after his death in 1994.  Having read just about everything the man had written, "Pulp" was a hugely disappointing epitaph.  If you've never read Bukowski start with "Post Office" or the short story collections, but avoid this like the plague.  A bad book.  I can't think of a single reason to recommend it 
 This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par 
 Why does this thing get all the great scores?  Doesn't anyone else see that Thomson's "Dictionary" is mean spirited and condescending?  Ok, maybe a couple of others.  I guess you could use this snob's eye view of the movie industry for a laugh at the brilliant putdowns with no substance to go with them.  For example, Thomson dismisses George Brent because he considers him overweight but spends a lot of time fawning over Johnny Carson. (Johnny Carson?)  Like his book about Nevada, Thomson's book about movie people seems to be an exercise in showing everyone how culturally superior David Thomson is.  So, Nevada is a "blank," and American filmmakers barely adequate, unless they're the artsy type?  Well, behind the words, David Thomson is also a blank, barely worth notice.  But he can still get published by the likes of Knopf.  Shows how low Knopf has sunk 
 Soros would like an Open Society created by peaceful means, where people can read what they want, criticize what they want, and elect whomever they want. Sort of like a utopia for intellectuals. Of course, that's preferable to the stage managed elections and callous warfare state that currently squats in Washington DC. Soros also includes much that Iraq protesters and anti-globalists can agree with, about how Cheyney and Co. are bringing the gift of freedom to the many dead Iraqis and how they want to sit on top the global dog pile permanently. No need to go into Soros' reasons here. Other reviewers have already done so, and besides, lambasting the Bush gang now amounts to a not-very-small publisher's bonanza.  However, there are two important points somehow overlooked by the author in his 200 pages-- namely `class' and `empire'. Yes-- `class' in that old Karl Marx sense of economic grouping that recognizes you according to where you fit in on that great ladder of production; and `empire', in the time honored sense of yanking wealth out of weaker foreign peoples, so that someone's core of rich and powerful can get richer and, uh, powerfuller.  Thumb through those 200 pages of Soros' book, you'll find not a single mention of American empire. Plenty of mentions of the Soviet empire, but nary a one of America's free fire zone. Yet what can be more obvious than the existence of an American imperium. Sure, it goes by many self-serving aliases, most often the 'Free World', but the reality is 700 military bases straddling the globe and a history of interventions from Central America to Iraq that can no longer be blamed on the Soviets, nor on the expansionist designs of the neo-cons. It really is difficult to talk about creating Open Societies when confronting an empire with a history of closing them down as soon as they become too threatening. George Soros, meet Noam Chomsky.  Then there's `class'. Our guardians thought they buried that concept along with the old Soviet Union. But here it is again. Market fundamentalism means the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and what's left of the middle-class hangs on to home-owners equity. It's not just US workers going to the poorhouse, but Europeans too, swept away by the same tide of capital migration and dollar-a-day east Asians. Along with them goes the safety-net state, on which Soros apparently models his alternative to the current do-nothing state, which, by the way, liberals said had gone the way of Herbert Hoover. Hard to talk about Open Societies when the top 5 % of Americans own the majority of America's wealth and the bottom 40% owns 0.2% (Mark Weisbrot)-- while the disparities grow worse every day. The point is that the wealthy class smells blood and will not be compromised by some well-meaning uplift, no matter how far-sighted. Marx may have over-hyped the concept of class, but its power moves daily through the halls of government.  Of course, Soros condemns the naked effects of empire and class-- that's the point of his book, since the Bush gang does not bother masking the structural rule of the two. He's eager to deal with the effects, but makes no mention of their source inside the system.  Instead, the author pretends that concern for national `sovereignty' is the only structural barrier to humane reform, spending pages agonizing over the difficulties. The bias is revealing. Unlike sovereignty, empire and class are generated not by some outside force, but by the internal workings of capital itself. Thus, Soros' insistence on private property maintains in his scheme the very impediments that will defeat it. How ironic -- but not surprising, considering that the author is one of the world's premier capitalists. Really, the only difference between his pipe dreams and yours and mine is the size of his bank book 
 If I had read this before the 2000 election. I would have learned that Americans want a leader that posseses honesty, compassion, morals, and the courage of his convictions. I should have at least pretended to posses some of these qualities. Bush stole Florida in 2000 and Ohio in '04, if you don't believe me just ask John Kerry. And where did I come up with that stupid imaginary lockbox stuff anyway 
 I have recently purchased the tape series of Love 101 much to my disappointment.  If you are looking for a little reinforcement and a different perspective on how to accomplish self-esteem, these are not the  tapes for you.  However, if you enjoy listening to introductions to clips  of nostalgic music and comedy routines then you might want to give this a  try.  I found that the subject matter had little to do with self-esteem  directly but more to do with announcing the next "ditty" ranging  from Mae West to Al Jolson and Groucho Marx.  I doubt if most of these  routines and songs have seen the light of day since the big band era. These  tapes were more of a trip down memory lane than a "boost" in  one's self-esteem 
 A reviewer below has made a mistake, or his review was misfiled:  This compilation is not to be confused with "King of the Delta Blues SINGERS."  THAT is the compilation which contains the alternate take of "Traveling Riverside Blues."  It and its companion, "King of the Delta Blues Singers, Volume 2" also have much better mastering than any other Robert Johnson collections that I am aware of.  Unfortunately, between them, ten alternate takes have yet to be upgraded from either mastering of the "Complete" collection.  I have not heard "King of the Delta Blues"--I am basing this information on the song sample Amazon has provided.  But given the song lineup, this is a confusingly unnecessary product 
 This book was disappointing in its lack of detail.  It doesn't really get into much depth on any topic and I just didn't learn anything from it 
 This is the last book I will attempt to read in this series. I previously stated on my last book  review that the series was becoming repetitive and I felt the author was attempting to drag out the story line to fill a certain amount of books due her contract. I could not even read this entire book. I am just happy that I did not purchase this as I have done so in the past. This series has become a soap opera with a occasional Amen. I feel this author has fallen from her graces that her previous books had provided. I would not recommend to anyone 
 Come on... needs more pictures. Phenomenological.. yeah, like that's a real word 
 I bought this CD during a visit to J-town in San Francisco last year and I was shocked at how un-listenable  the CD was, I think I only liked two of the tracks. The mix overall is very uneven, I wouldn't consider this as a fair sampling of available jpop,  this is an unfortunate rubbish tip packaged for quick sale to the poor soul looking to explore a rich and fun musical vein 
 Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine? Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman in America but all I hear is American educational institutions praising Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience". I don't deny that he has made some points worth considering in his book but many people have made the same points without whining and railing at humanity.  I would dearly like to say I had the patience to read this book all the way through but it is perhaps the only book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.   The phrase that most ran through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was "o'erweening arrogance". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way.  I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.  I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted. So, I'd love to pepper my "critique" with quotes that I found completely offensive and juvenile but that would mean getting the book again and I *really* don't want to do that 
 It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator, but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion. It may be of interest to photography academics, but I doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful 
 After using the dryer (which I liked very much and did a quick job), I discovered that my hair was being ruined.  It would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces.  I stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair.  I would like to return it and get my money back!!!   
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  Barbet Schroeder's film, a "self-portrait" of the infamous Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, generated much controversey and even death threats. Idi Amin himself demanded that Schroeder remove particular scenes from the film under the threat of killing french citizens living in Uganda.  The film is well written but almost appears sympathetic to Amin.  The DVD only has an interview with director Barbet Schroeder for a special feature, although the liner notes contain a transcript of a letter Amin write requesting the deletion of particular scenes.  This film has significance, but is not a good one 
    The book had a very strong start. I will give no spoilers, but after Wyl Thirsk was given the Gift the book seemed to change. It was as almost as if this is where the editor jumped in and began to remove or shorten key issues. Explanations for bizarre events and happenings came quickly and easily, or were dismissed altogether. Villains would have a short chapter just before they were needed. They were often foul with a quirky inner dialog. Once used they would quickly be disposed of and a new set would arrive when needed without failure.     In one chapter the point of view switched from soldiers on a battlement, to the Queen, to a young boy walking through the gates. This happened with greater frequency the more Fiona told the story. It is the same reason that I started to read "Wayfarer Redemption" by Sara Douglass and had to put it down after a handful of pages.      As you may have read in some other reviews there is a dog in the book that has a special gift. After helping the Queen and a young boy he runs off only to show up at the time when Wyl needs him the most.  Wyl had just finished traveling by horseback for over a week when he received a blow of misfortune. The dog saved the day, was given a hearty "atta boy" and was sent back to help the Queen and young boy.     I read this one up until page 282. The straw that broke the camel's back was written on page 271. "He was soon luxuriating in fragranced, steaming water." Wyl, apparently, needed this respite.    I had hoped, in vain, the rest of the book would have been as good as the 1st quarter.  
 He told us what was wrong with current belief-what is the replacement and where is the scientific backing for his view 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 The writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense.  I thought something might change, that it might become an interesting ghost story, or there might be moral issues, or maybe even a character would grow or change.  The heavy-handed ending is, perhaps, intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in Amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones...but that's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness.  Are we supposed to take everything that Ellie says about the Amish in court (peaceful, gentle, incapable of murder, loving, child-centric, willing to accept an out-of-wedlock child into the community) as lies?  The ending belongs to a much darker book.  My biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing, I kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story.  
 The best thing about this book are the repro photos of Hemingway and his contemporaries.  Sadly, the author's own photos, scavenged from his previous trip files, are mostly poor stock.  The same can be said of his writing.  There are no new nor creditable insights into Hemingway here, in fact you will mainly learn about author Ondaarje's own quirks and predelictions, ad nauseum.  Ondaatje is not a hunter, knows nothing of hunting, and yet presupposes his ability to dissect "Hemingway in Africa" when in fact hunting was the sole motivator for Ernest's 1933 trip to the dark continent.  It's like a medical biography penned by a chimney sweep.  You will get very little insight into Ernest Hemingway as the book wanders hither and yon.  Even worse, the book is full of factual errors and shaky assumptions as Ondaatje waddles over the landscape searching Hemingway's trail.  Ondaatje had previously been in Africa for a book on British explorers Speke and Burton.  It is apparent he decided to capitalize on that experience and become a literary critic.  He has failed miserably.  Buy the book for the pictures, nothing else... 
 I never received this product and will not order from you again. When there is a problem, you are not easy to reach 
 I didn't find journaling and the recovery phase at all helpful. I think it's a lot of theory and not enough practical wisdom and the section on making requests for what you want in your partner totally ridiculous. In real life this doesn't work. 
 This book was horrid.  I was bombing the class all year with this text, until I bought REA's electromagnetics problem solver.  Going into the final, I had maybe a B.  By studying the REA book and working my [...] off before the final, I got that up to a final mark of A-.  The physics students at my school used Griffith's electrmagnetics book, and they seemed to enjoy that book a lot more.  This book was slightly better when I took a waveguides course... imagine my disgust when I found out we were using this book, again!  Even the waveguides sections were still quite weak, though, but they do keep me from rating this book a 1. 
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 What has happened to Monster's quality?  In 2003-04, I had a discount on Monster cable through my employer and purchased close to $1000 (retail prices) worth of their cables for wiring up my home theater. I have been using the Gamelink with s-video for my PS2 and that works great. Here it is 3 years later and I buy these Gamelink 400 for use with my new HDTV with component inputs. When I tried to install them I thought I was going to snap the connections off my TV because of the amount of force I had to exert. With much determination I got them to connect. I switched on the PS2 and experienced no video just sound. I had even a harder time removing them. When comparing these cables to my older s-video Gamelinks the differences are the new wires are lighter, rigid and the connectors are definately too small in diameter.  In hand, they feel cheaper compared to the heavier more pliable older wires. I will no longer buy Monster cables and I do not recommend these to anyone. Audioquest is much better.  Too bad they don't make gaming cables 
 Tom Clancy has made his fame and fortune writing of the techno thriller exploits of Jack Ryan. His first books in the series, beginning with THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, delivered thrills as promised. But with THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON, Clancy has gone to the well once (possibly more considering EXECUTIVE ORDERS) too often. If Clancy were a novice author, it is not likely an editor would publish such a bloated and going-nowhere novel. The problem is not that Clancy has lost the ability to write. Rather, as he has churned out one bestseller after another, he has increasingly become the worst of all literary plagiarists; he has copied from himself. What is clear from merely holding such a massive novel (1,100 pages plus)is that if one comes to THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON from say, EXECUTIVE ORDERS, there is the sneaking suspicion that Clancy will place the titular hero Jack Ryan in a secondary capacity, have him mouth platitutes about his feelings about his new and unwanted job, and have Ryan react to rather than interact with the novel's complicating elements. In addition, Clancy here continues to fill out his novels with excessive details about bombs, missiles, and technical wizardry that do not materially add to the thrust of the action. As I was following the numerous and ill-connected subplots, I grew to realize that by page 900, Clancy had committed the worst sin a novelist could commit: the sinking feeling that Nothing Much Is Happening. An egregious example occurs when a male CIA operative subverts a female Chinese stenographer in Beijing into betraying her country solely on his amatory capacity to seduce. She is the flat character that occasionally pops up in any novel, and in her cringing and servile attitude toward her seducer, I myself felt like turning her in to her Communist party bosses. By the time the real business of the book happens, the obligatory chapters where missiles fly, guns explode, and nameless soldiers die, the end of the book was thankfully near. In this case, the conclusion involving a reworking of Tiannamen Square was so implausible that I could now see why Ryan wins as often as he does--his enemies are unintelligent buffoons.  And if the Bad Guys of the book command the reader's attention even with their wayward ways, then you are quite sure that the hero needs to be rebuilt into someone who is more decisive than passive. It is time for Jack Ryan, in future Clancy novels, to appear in more chapters and to grapple more directly with upcoming bears and dragons. 
 This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?   
 Ooo, I feel badly for reviewing this book this way, but... I really wasn't that impressed with High in the Clouds.  I thought it was full of oversimplifications, that the characters weren't well developed, and things happened in the book because it was convenient for them to happen.  From the start, I was put off - for example, Wirral's mother is killed when the bulldozers destroy the Woodland.  However, amidst the mayhem and carnage, Wirral is able to get his father's old raft, put his mother on it, and then decorate it with piles of flowers?  And even as this is going on, the forest is still being destroyed, with branches falling around him and others begging him to leave?  Not only is the story muddled, but the artwork doesn't represent this at all.  I felt that the personalities of the characters were very much stereotyped.  While the narrative has some fun asides, they often seemed to leave children out of the loop.  It seems that no one settled on a particular writing style for the entire story.  I really wish that more detail and revision had been put into this story - lots of the characters are very interesting, but we learn so little about them.  For example, what are some of the 101 reasons that Alfredo the flea hates Gretsch?  Why does Froggo have a wooden leg?  And why on earth would the animals leave their children with Gretsch as a babysitter?  I really did want to enjoy this book, but I felt that it was incomplete 
 Bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but I was very dissapointed with it. Clunky control system really put me off 
 This is a decent book outlining the basic tenets of libertarian philopshy on how things work in the real world. My problem with the book is it never deals with the real issues of the left with free trade that is the doctrine being pushed on Thrid World countries. Then the arguments become absurd. Unions have become more militant in the US because of their lack of power and Mexican women are happy to work 80 hours per week and love taking birth controll pills evry morning as prerequsit to employment (Roberts dosent say this but these are the conditions under whihc many people work in free trade zones. So if he claims Mexicans love the jobs that are brought through NAFTA and dont want clean drinking water or clean air then they must love these conitions). And i love this argument: America had sweathops too. But the book forgets to mention that free trade  did not improve the conditions of wrokers in this country, collective actions by the workers did.  Also a little history fact: No country has ever industriliazed through free trade and that is the truth no matter what your economics books tell you.  However, this does not delegitimize the free trade doctorine but it is certainly something that needs to be talked about.  Read Globalization and Its Discontents by Stieglitz instead 
 I have the third edition as published in 1997, at a much higher price than the current book. This book was useless even in 1997.   The author believes in accreting, not revising. So chapter 13 was entitled "New Developments 1995", and chapter 31 entitled "New Developments: 1996 and Early 1997". In between is a disorganized hodgepdge of articles about software, medical devices, foreign filings, and so on. The style of writing is discursive, with almost no diagrams (only one chapter out of 31 has any diagrams at all) and no summaries or bullet point lists to help a busy patent practitioner.   The material itself generally is (i) outdated, (ii) well-known to patent attorneys, and/or (iii) too disorganized and episodic to give a layperson any useful understanding of patent strategy.  I strongly suspect that the glowing reviews elsewhere on this page are written by the author's friends and family, if not the author himself. When I move to a new office a few weeks from now, this book will be heading off my bookshelf and deep into my garage -- if it's lucky.  
 As a fan of Mme. Austen, Thomas Hardy, D.H. Lawrence and other sundry novelists of manner, I freely admit to a hopeless addiction to "period" pieces -- and romances, in particular -- and this weakness clearly plays into the VERY generous aforementioned 2-star rating.  "Northanger Abbey" is a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon, but PLEASE don't expect this movie to be anything like the big-money Hollywood adaptations of Mme. Austen's other works.  The acting is over-the-top; the soundtrack, deplorable; and the characters (with the exception of Eleanor) are completely unsympathetic.  Catherine is portrayed as an insipid half-wit, rather than a day-dreamy post-adolescent on the verge of womanhood.  Peter Firth's Henry Tilney vascilates between compassionate, brotherly concern and annoyingly superior arrogance.  By the end of the movie, I had lost all patience with them and was convinced that Henry & Catherine fully deserve the misery they will inevitably wreak upon each other.  (This from a romance buff!) Most will give up before the end of the film, but true Austen fans will enjoy the parade of costumes, witty repartee, and the opportunity to daydream about the Regency culture.  Watch it or don't -- but if you choose to watch, make sure you do so with a sense of humor and forebearance.  
 I was disappointed at the dismissal of social scientific evidence in favour of a priori conservative christian observations about deviation from an a priori normative basis. Disturbingly, this seemed to be on the basis  that some forms of cult or new religious movement had too much in common  with fundamentalism's own authoritarianism, failure to respect intellectual  freedom (or "relativism". However, how else is one meant to  assess whether an NRM is harmful or not? Gomes fails to realise the  implications of social scientific or psychological studies that do show  such correspondences between authoritarian NRMs and fundamentalist  Christianity, while harmless and non-authoritarian religious traditions are  also included in this series solely on the basis of alleged philosophical  deviation, and no other reason. I don't think anyone outside fundamentalism  will be impressed with the latter criteria as sole basis. Moreover, it also  suffers from the relativist strawperson argument. And if the NRM is  politically conservative, it is interesting to note how much of that gets  let out of the Zondervan series, compared to liberal alternative religions  such as Unitarian Universalism 
 I read many rave reviews of this film and so bought it confident that I would enjoy the film.  Admittedly I'm not a fanboy of Tarkovsky, but I had heard of the storyline of "Roadside Picnic" which this was inspired by and which has translated into a fabulous computer game (Stalker -- 2007).  I was fully expecting something strange and perhaps slow, but had an otherwise open mind.  The beginning of the movie is intriguing -- the Stalker and his companions plan to penetrate into the Zone past the military checkpoint.  This they carry off at great risk to themselves.  Finally clear of the military, they confront the Zone itself with all its dangers.  They confront the first appearance of an anomaly in great trepidation.  There is a glimpse of something unusual in the tall grass.  All this should set the heart of players of the game Stalker racing, and without having read the book, I would imagine up to this point the movie is very faithful to the story.   Now had Tarkovsky continued in however minimal a fashion with this great opening, the film would have been stunning.  But the highpoint of the film after this point -- or, excuse me, the highpoint of the action in the film -- would be an encounter with a real dog.  The interim period up until the finale, which had its moments, consists of long looks at murky mud puddles and beautiful long pans of an ugly albeit colorful landscape.  It's an internal film, all right, which is another way to say it is stupefyingly boring unless you're just fine with zero action.  This was Tarkovsky's stated intention -- he knew the story and could have made a post apocalyptic film like so many others, but he wanted something different.  I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one -- otherwise why would so many wax poetic on the brilliance of this film?  But from the perspective of one with a fairly high tolerance for oddity and slow spots, I must say this movie is worth a rental but a hard sell for a permanent spot in ones collection.  I drifted in and out of conciousness trying to stay awake to see something interesting.  Beautifully photographed and musically scored, this is a yawner of staggering eminence.  Here's hoping someone will adapt the story with a bit of Tarkovsky's genius without his obsessions, which I'm afraid render the whole affair rather sterile 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 After reading the great reviews of the votivo candles I decided to spend the rediculous sum of $24 on a moroccan spice candle.When I received the candle I smelled sweet spice coming from it even before I opened the packaging.Readying myself for a rocket of rich fragrance immersing my room in exotic spice I hopefully lit the candle.After about an hour of the candle being lit I came into my room and it scented only about 3 feet around the candle.Dissapointed, and perhaps to prove that there was absolutely no way I didn't get jacked on this purchase I lit it again-this time for 3 hours.There was still no smell.Compare this with the $6 'tea' candles I bought from the Gold Canyon Candle Co. which when I lit 6 of them richly scented not only my room (which is about 13' 13') but the hallway, as well as my mothers room next door (16' 16')!If your thinking that maybe the $22+ dollars would be worth it for the exotic fragrances-think again as there was nothing special about the scent that you couldn't get from the grocery store. Jipped-you bet 
 I ordered Official Whitman Statehood Quarters Folder: Complete 50 State Set 1999-2008 to my friend as a gift. She said this is a junk and cheating product.  This is because its design is ugly and inside has only 40 slots which is 1999-2006. And I agree with her 
 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 This book was a huge disappointment.  It was very basic and very vague.  For example, it would tell you to shape the brow to make their face look longer or shorter, but it wouldn't tell you how to shape the brow in order to do that.  All the pictures were small, in black and white, and it was hard to see any detail.  I kept on reading on, hoping that I was going to get to the good stuff, but the good stuff never came.  I truly felt like I learned nothing and it was supposed to be an instructional book.  A waste of money.  I was debating returning it, but it doesn't seem worth it to go to the post office and have to pay for shipping it back 
 While Pavement has merit, has anybody noticed that their singer can't sing.  He can't carry a tune.  His voice constantly breaks.  Listen to him sing REM's Camera and then compare to Michael Stipe's singing on the original. Like all albums on Amazon, the reviews for this album are consistently raves, as only huge fans typically take the time to write reviews. 
 Ten years ago, I worked for a company which was in the midst of a culture crisis. Part of this crisis was due to the owner's insistence on managing from afar and not allowing skilled managers to make decisions based on local needs. This crisis came to a head when the owner met the author of this book on a ski - lift.   The main premise of the author's "philosophy" is this: people play(read: work) harder during their time off than they do at their jobs. [I'm alright with this part.] The reason being, according to the author, is that nobody keeps score at work. This, of course, is patently ridiculous. Almost every company keeps score on their employees in some way and most of us enjoy 'sports' in our off-time that don't keep score.  The author was brought in to train us in his "method'. Keep in mind that we already had complex yearly reviews and most managers were selected after they had met certain criteria in personality tests. Some people may be intrigued by the author's writing but his personal style is boorish. He typically ate while he lectured and his constant reliance on record - breaking sports events as an example of what people at work should do every day not only alienated non - sports minded people but showed the second major weakness in his philosophy. Guys get paid millions of dollars for getting a hit 30% of the time - not grand slams every time they come up to bat. But that was the author's next premise - that we had to perform these types of record feats everyday. (This strategy is not restricted merely to the author, sadly, but seems to be a major strategy of most US companies.)    The author had a difficult time with me especially as most of my hobbies involve physical activities in which one does not keep score - surfing, hiking, gardening, etc. I actually argued the contrary to the author's philosophy - that people actually played harder than they worked precisely because no one was keeping score when they played, as I stated above. However, discussing this with the author was like the narrator of "This Is Spinal Tap" questioning the notion of 'this one goes to 11' with Nigel. The author just kept repeating his litany about needing to keep score.   We started measuring anything that could be measured - this was keeping score. Then, because they could be measured they had to be reduced. Things that were vital to the integrity of the product were cut back on in order 'to win'. The product (and product reputation)was damaged and some of the better people soon left the company. Eventually, we careened into other changes in company philosophy and left this "Game" behind. Sadly, none of these philosophies helped- but that is another matter.  This author's work is dreck. You would do better to read Scott Adams and do exactly the opposite of Catbert, Ratbert, and the Pointy - Haired Boss.  Make it interesting, make it fun, treat people with respect and people will work hard.  They may still work harder at play but that is probably human nature. After all, there are words for "work" and "play" - they are not one. Keeping score doesn't really play into it 
 Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't "light reading" or entertaining at all. Be warne 
 This handlebar mount mirror was most disappointing. The adjustable mirror shaft has next to no memory and creeps into a position which is totally unusable. Don't risk your safety or your dollars on this product. It's simply not worth the inexpensive price 
 I saw Caroline Myss on her book tour, and I was deeply touched by her message.  I also saw her shred a couple of people in the audience.  I think she needs to walk the talk.    I was surprised and disappointed that her CD's were so angry and self-righteous and critical of others.  I definitely got some good information and wisdom out of it, without a doubt, but I am amazed that she makes fun of people so openly and shamelessly and unapologetically.  It is comical to hear her tirades and then to switch gears to the meditations.  I think she needs to get into the fifth mansion or whichever one it is and throw away her reason because it is warped.    I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying the CD's since they contain valuable wisdom if you can sift through all of her ranting and raving 
       I got this pesent for Christmas last year. A few days later I started to make it. It took aprox.4 hours to build. It was fun at first then after 2 hours my hands were hurting and I figured out that alot of peices were wrong and I tried to undo them but my hands hurt like heck. So I left it like it was for a few days. Then a few weeks later my brothers friend came over and fixed it for me. He built it all correct. The music wored fine but the motor would not spin the BIG wheel. It also was quite loud. I dont rate this toy for kids under the age of 11. It was reallt hard. The friend of my brothers was 18. LOL  
 Recently I completed teaching a seven week series on the sacraments. As I prepared my studies and made a short list of resources that I wanted to make available to those studying with me, I asked myself "Now, regarding baptism, what kind of book do I need?"   		What I needed was a single volume that constructs its case out of a close reading of the biblical data, that interacts with well-known objections in a clear but polite manner, and that sets forth the mainlines of covenant theology in such a way as to show how infant baptism properly belongs to that system and to the life of the Christian church. What I choose was The Case for Covenantal Baptism.   		Written by a number of respected pastors and professors serving in various Reformed and evangelical settings, The Case for Covenantal Baptism does not break new ground, but it does offer substantial discussions of key biblical passages (e.g. Mt.28:18-20; Ac.2:39; Rom.4:11-12; 6:3-6; Heb.8:11-12; Jer.31; et.al). Further, it places the discussion of paedo-baptism (and the debate surrounding it) firmly within the covenantal context of Scripture. While some differences among the contributing authors are evident, yet for the most part this volume is remarkably even and coherent. Certainly it does make a clear case for covenantal baptism as well as offering theological and pastoral insight on the place of children in the Old and New Testaments and in the congregation.  		Although there are now several good books on infant baptism available, yet I believe this articulate and constructive volume will be of benefit to pastors desirous of instructing their congregations in the sacraments. It will also be of value to seminary graduates heading into the pastorate and to continuing seminary students as a supplement to lectures. Finally, The Case for Covenantal Baptism should also prove helpful and therefore be appreciated by those studying this issue and endeavoring to make up their minds about the biblical validity of this precious practice.  
 This film tells a story about LaSalle Parish in Louisiana (and by extension the rest of America). Sheriff Darryl is shown handling the rigors of his job. Oddly, he carries no pistol - a symbol of lacking something? A truck overturns on a curve, and spills its load of shoes. The poor people show up to carry off their free shoes, recalling that scene in Charles Dickens "Tale of Two Cities". Then a dead body is found, and this scandal should be censored, says the political boss and judge. Sheriff Darryl is visited by an exotic dancer who reports her husband is missing (after dancing at a private club). The rest of the film tells how the murder was solved.  The language and contents of this film would have been banned prior to the 1990s. While "realistic" about the lost souls it portrays, it seems to have no redeeming social values. Yes, it gives a view to politics and personalities not usually seen in films, and which can educate the viewers. The film does not mention the corporations (like Big Oil) that dominated the politics of Louisiana, and other states. We see how the Twin-Party System meets at the top to accomplish its missions. Like in a small county, the heads of the opposing parties meet to divide the spoils. In this film the Governor loses an election. Was he too clean? So a new Administration takes office, and life goes on unchanged. There are some winners and loser, but that's the way the ball bounces. Blaming a small businessman who has a claim against the county seems too cynical. 
 Genny and Alec meet in America and from that point on it goes downhill. This book was immediately put in the trash.  I kept reading it hoping it would get better, it didn't, it got worse.  Alec was a barbarian and needed taken down a notch or two.  He wasn't even worthy of Nesta, let alone Genny.  There was no real closure to their problems and Alec's cruel heart, either.  How could you believe he loved her?  Genny needs to hit him on the head again 
 i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips, it just wont glide. you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em. clinique liners are the worst one in the market 
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Sorry to be extreme, but after dealing with infertility for two years I'm finally pregnant thanks to IVF. I am disgusted by her obsession with her thinness ( I was a size 6 when fertility treatments started two years ago - now I'm a size 10 or so and wouldn't trade it for anything because now I get to be a mommie). Her smoking was disgusting...Her declaration to "cram" for all her baby knowledge was appalling. What an idiot - I rarely feel so strongly about a book but this one pushed me over the edge. What an insult to pregnancy and the life process. I'm throwing it away... 
 This book is good for young artists and young artists only. If you're a kid who just wants to enhance your doodling skills then buy this book! The markers it comes with are water based, cheap, and nothing like what the pros use. If you are over 13 or you are young but want to become a very serious artist do not buy this book! you should buy: How To Draw the Marvel Way by Stan Lee. That book is quite a bit more advanced and involved for drawing your favorite Marvel characters and for creating your own characters 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 I am very disappointed with this product.  Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less.  I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features 
 Feiler's book is entertaining at times and tiresome at others. The entertaining parts are the stories he tells about his experiences; however, his attempt to analyze Japan sound too much like a regurgitation of other books that purport to introduce Japanese culture.   As others have pointed out, the information is quite dated and Japanese high schools have changed greatly. It suffers also from some rather curious translations, which mystify rather than clarify. I'm not sure I'd call shiso "mint" or edible chrysanthemum "a bright yellow daisy". Even more mysterious is how he manages to translate "higaisha" as "one who receives pressure" when the characters literally mean "receiving injury person". A much better translation is "victim", and in fact Japan's "victim consciousness" is an important theme in how they understand WWII. James Orr's book "Victim as Hero" explores this theme carefully.  If you're interested in finding out about Japanese culture, read something by a trained anthropologist. If you're interested in someone's experiences in Japan in the late 1980s then parts of this book will serve you well 
 This book is written by one of Ackoff's disciples.  In the middle of the dot.com boom, while many less qualified people were successfully marketing "high-concept" business books, JG must have felt the urge to join the club.  After all, as a managing director of a strategy consulting firm and a former Wharton professor, he was indeed more qualified than a journalist to do so.  Unlike Ackoff however, this author does not have the greatness of the mind nor the sharpness of the pen.  Many statements would be considered plagiaristic if they weren't tired cliches.  Therefore, this book is nothing at all of the sort of wonderful things that all these other reviewers are claiming it to be. One of the more useful and accurate reviews on these pages is written by Keith Bycholski below.  His indictment is only a shade harsher than mine.  The bibliography is good and the acknowledgements of great minds and their contributions to the field are a valuable source of further study.  Occasionally, JG has some brilliant sage advice sentences of the kind a good father figure might utter.  Those are worth underlining or being incorporated into a web site by one of his admirers or by himself. A thin essay volume focusing on human nature and society might have been a hit indeed. Half of the book is about the theory of systems thinking, not very systematically written.  The second half is a summary of JG's work with selected clients.  For  consultants selling strategy engagements to clients, this part may be of some value as long as you are talking to CEO's and top administrators of non-business organizations who are at a complete loss as to what to do with their organization 
 In the past, I have good impressions of DLink products with the combination of features and price, but this particular Router is one to stay away from.  Dlink should have tested the product much more extensively before releasing it.  The original firmware (Jan 2005) is full of bugs, and two attempts at v1.2 upgrades made the router unusable.  DLink support attempted to be helpful, but it seems that they are not aware of the problems with this particular router, and the responses I received were not helpful at all.  After going through two routers, I returned them to the store and bought an Airlink SuperG AR420W at half the price (on sale), and worked flawlessly the first time around. I like the feature set and the web GUI is pleasant, but the bugs are too severe and make the product unusable: 1. DNS doesn't work after a short period of time   2. Incorrect  listing of DHCP clients  3. Upgrade of firmware cause the web application on the router to "die" 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought 
 Under Eye Bryten was not as good as I had expected it to be - quite disappointing in fact!  It did very little to reduce eye puffiness and no change to dark circles has been witnessed, however I am not certain this product was produced for black skin so that could be the reason why 
 This play, mysteriously awarded prizes, must be the most conventional, boring work of the last decade. As at least one reviewer argues, there's nothing fresh here, nothing that transcends the hip soap-operatic. Margulies is the John Grisham or Robert Ludlum of playwrights. He should be writing TV dramas where the absence of philosophical subtext or depth is taken for granted. Only sentimentalists who swoon over problems in "relationships" could take this pabulem seriously. Apparently these days, this includes the Pulitzer Committee. It's good to remember, though, that this Committee, at least in drama awards, is overly fond of the safe and conventional. It prefers toothless works to anything with real bite. It rewards an empty work like "Three Tall Women" but scorns the unnerving "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" No doubt it will continue to reward the forthcoming effusions of the tame Donald Margulies 
 Me, my husband and my daugther all HATED this CD.  The artist line-up seemed so good, but the very creepy & morose first track, "Pure Imagination" only led to further disappointments as the CD progressed.  The only track worth listening to was the "Rainbow Connection" by the Dixie Chicks, but it really wasn't worth skipping through all of the other heavy and uninspired tracks.  I wasted my money on this one 
 This book's explanations vary from poor to excellent. The derivations, while they are given, are not well done. They often skip steps that leaving the reader wondering just how they got from point A to point B. The answers in the back of the book and in the instructor's solutions manual are also often incorrect. The publisher of this book also elected to put large sections of this book online instead of in the book. An entire chapter, the astrophysics section, is online, which is absolutely ludicrous for such an expensive book. Overall, this book just doesn't cut it 
 While the book is a "good read" and "thought provoking," I have serious contentions with Holton's interpretation and analysis on many levels, not the least of which center on his lack of understanding and/or misinterpretation of the military and Indian issues which he attempts to cite as supporting his thesis, and which in turn causes me to question his other conclusions in "Forced Founders."  First, he apparently does not know the difference between the provincial militia of the royal colony, the independent militia formed at the resolution of the First Virginia Convention (and Continental Association after the First Continental Congress), or the Virginia militia as constituted by Virginia's revolutionary government, the Virginia Minutemen (as different from common militia) formed by the state in response to a resolution by the Second Continental Congress, the formation of Virginia State Troops or the establishment of the Virginia Continentals.  To him, all those organizational concepts seem to be interchangeable.      Second, it is true that Virginia's last royal governor, John Murray, the Fourth Earl of Dunmore, formed his "Ethiopian Regiment" by offering freedom to the military age male slaves of rebel masters (not all slaves), but Holton's explanation leads the reader to believe that the project was an overwhelming success.  The primary source documents show that it was never accepted into Provincial service, and with less than 100 "effective" men present for duty, and about 60 sick on board hospital ships in May 1776, the regiment was disbanded.  Furthermore, they were not Dunmore's only available troops.  So how their presence forced slaveholders to support the revolution is questionable.    Holton also neglects to mention Dunmore's raising of the Queen's Own Loyal Regiment of Virginia, which was composed of white Loyalists.  It too, like the Ethiopian Regiment, never amounted to much and was disbanded in 1776.  But Holton doesn't mention them at all!    Third he mentions the battle of Kemp's Landing (a skirmish, actually) in November 1775, in which Dunmore's "army" (not just the black troops) drove Virginia militia from the field.  He says nothing about the December 1775 battle (actually a larger skirmish) of Great Bridge that was a decisive American victory and forced the British to evacuate Norfolk (and Virginia until 1780).    Furthermore, Dunmore's army was about 600 strong, including the white Loyalist regiment, all the Loyalist militia he could muster, plus British sailors and marines, as well as the Ethiopian Regiment.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the Ethiopian Regiment ever neared full "establishment" strength of 800 men, so I believe Holton overstates their influence.  Also, the American force included Continentals, State troops, minutemen from Fauquier, Augusta and Culpepper Counties (from the western part of the Colony), as well as volunteers from Princess Anne and Norfolk Counties, including one company of "gentleman volunteers," and 250 North Carolina men.   Nor does Holton say much about those slaves who chose to stay with their masters, and how their action influenced decisions to support independence.  As for the founder's being forced by fear of the Indians, his argument on that score is also weak.    First, does he consider the Treaty of Camp Charlotte, which Dunmore negotiated with the Shawnee, Mingo and western Delaware nations in October 1774, when they conceded defeat in "Dunmore's War"?  After his flight from Williamsburg in June 1775, the terms of that treaty were finalized between Continental and (Revolutionary) Virginia Indian Commissioners and the same Indian nations in the Treaty of Fort Pitt in October 1775.  The two treaties essentially kept the peace on Virginia's frontier (including in Kentucky) from 1774 until 1777 (after independence was declared!).  So, Holton's claim that fear of the Indians forced the founders into supporting independence seems to be a weak one to me.  Second, Dunmore did plot to solicit the Ohio Indian nations to attack settlements on the Virginia frontier, unless its inhabitants affirmed their loyalty.  However, the party of three Provincial officers he dispatched to put the plan into action (led by John Connolly), were captured by Maryland minutemen in the town of Hagers Town (Hagerstown) in November 1775, and Connolly was subsequently imprisoned in Philadelphia.  The abortive plot was discovered when incriminating papers were found in Connolly's baggage, which was the source of Jefferson's indictment in the Declaration of Independence that king was "inciting the savages."  Third, Holton apparently also does not understand the operation of the Indian polities.  He fails to mention that the Six Nations of Iroquois, who considered the nations in the Ohio country their "dependents" by right of conquest and "spoke for" them, were trying to maintain their neutrality early in the war.  After being convinced by the officers of the British Indian Department (operating from Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, not Virginia) that it was in their best interest to support the king against "the Bostonians," most of the Six Nations (the Onondaga, Cayuga, Mohawk and Seneca) and their "dependents," (Wyandot, western Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo and others) did finally come into the war in early 1777, when they struck backcountry settlements, according to British Indian Department officers, "from Fort Stanwix (at the head of the Mohawk Valley in New York) to the Ohio" and that the American backcountry "From the Susquehanna to the Kiskismenitas Creek upon the Ohio, and from thence down to the Kankawa [Kanawha] River is now nothing but an heap of ashes."              Finally, I don't believe Holton ever makes a convincing argument that tenants exerted influence to force their aristocratic landlords into supporting independence, and his argument about debtors falls short of being conclusive.    
 HD crashed after just couple of months of light using. Now I cannot switch it on. Ive tried anything, including factory resetting, nothing works.   Customer support experience is horrible.

 brian de palma doesn't just rip-off hitchcock in "obsession" he steals the body. this might as well say "a vertigo remake"    cliff robertson(a fine actor wasted here)isn't as watchable as james stewert was and really the "mystery" of this "piece" isn't a mystery if you think about it for one second. stick to "vertigo" and see the way this film should have looked 
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 This book is more of an academic approach to the internal martial arts than th zen koan parable style I'm used to.  I'm sure if you spent months pouring over every page and looking up every 10 dollar word, you might  actually reap some benefit from this book.  But if you're looking for some  spiritual insight, some quaint story that will enhance your being and  improve your practise, look elsewhere

 My buddy died wearing this mask.  Well he didn't die but he lost his eye.  The mask got hit in the mesh and broke and all in his eye. 
 This book reads like an excellent translation from the work of a so-so contemporary French poet trying to sound like an American 
 uh......... no this book had litle to be desired and its just not cool with all them big words i mean come on.  Whats a sherry and what is an  amontdillo i dont even know. loserbook. Go Central High Footbal 
 Mann is an interesting person, but he cracked no cases in this book.  At best, he provided evidence that supported what police were just about 100% certain of already.  I have no idea what he tried to accomplish by writing "Forensic Detective;" however, there is no doubt whatsoever that it is not worth reading 
 Trying to mix the positive thinking of Robert Schuller, and the faith movement theology of Paul Yonggi Cho and Kenneth Copeland, Osteen has taken the stadium seminar circuit to a new level. Augmented now by his book, "Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential" he pushes the find the god/champion within yourself.  Here, we see he has a study guide to help point out what is not difficult to understand with his book. To his credit, there are a few more Scriptures laced into this guide. However, the main book is not making any points that a study guide will enhance, and only the lowliest of sheep will need the extra help.  People who are down on their luck, or discouraged with life will find Osteen a good read. It is a feel-good book, reducing the image of Christianity to be about us and not about God. Bigger than life is Osteen's picture on the cover, knowing that if you saw him on TV, you might want his book.  "Getting your mind off of yourself," with the goal of self-fulfillment should appeal also to readers of Wayne W. Dyer and other authors looking to reach those who feel disenfranchised.   Osteen's rambling, choppy speaking style comes through, written like he's campaigning for office. Reading like a seminar set to print, it sums as quickly as reading through its self-determinist table of contents:   1. Enlarge your vision  2. Develop a healthy self-image  3. Discover the power of your thoughts and words  4. Let go of the past  5. Find strength through adversity  6. Live to give  7. Choose to be happy   The steps sound innocuous, and, outside of their religious context, are. Within their religious context, evangelicals and charismatics will likely find offense at Osteen's assertions about controlling your own destiny as opposed to letting God control it.   Aim a little higher, and check out Charles Colson's "The Good Life." The title sounds similar, but Colson defines what makes for a good life far differently than Osteen. Save your money, and if you have Osteen's book, read it without the guide.  Anthony Trendl  editor, HungarianBookstore.co 
 This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts 
 It's not just that this book is written horribly (it's nothing but extreme excerpts from people who've obviously made therapy their personal hobby).  It's not just that this book fails to offer actual constructive ideas about dealing with trust issues (although it does explain, ad nauseum, all the ways you might see trust issues).  The real problem is that it sounds like the most old-school, formulaic psycho-babble you could possible imagine.  In a nutshell, here's what this book will tell you:  1.  it's all because of your parents and 2.  it's all because of your gender.  Helpful?  NO!  I really have no idea where all the good reviews on this book are coming from.  Seriously, if I didn't have such extreme trust issues, I'd wonder if the author didn't pay a couple of his friends to drop Amazon a note.. 
 I ordered this Mocha Java because the Green Mountain brand was not available.  There is no comparison.  I am very disappointed in the flavor of this coffe 
 I might as well re-draft this review as only 0 of 2 people enjoyed the first draft.  That's wouldn't normally phase me, but I can do better for you in this case.    I first saw a segment of ST-2 on cable and mistook it for an anemically budgeted direct-to-DVD release.  This ticked me off a bit because I'm a fan of Phil Tippett, who got his major feature film directorial shot on this movie.    Having now got the DVD, I have unreeled it from the beginning and I find it loads more ambitious, intelligent and well rendered by director Tippett than I had given the producers credit for permitting.  Tippett has been an innovator in the CGI field -- stop-motion, go-motion, and transitional model-to-CGI models manipulated so as to provide dynamic effects for an impressive array of digital creatures. Among those milestones are the perfectly convincing insect creatures in the first STARSHIP TROOPERS movie. The multitudes of individually rendered creatures in STARSHIP TROOPERS are spotlessly realistic.    As a general rule, if a studio greenlights a movie sequel as a direct-to-DVD release, they intend to suffocate the production -- whether the franchise has been good, bad or mediocre in the market -- by simply failing to provide a generous -- or even a minimal budget -- to sustain life support in any recognizable way.  Trust me -- starve any sequel of support and money and you become a key factor in ruining even the best of franchises.    STARSHIP TROOPERS (the first) was not a runaway commercial hit on first run, apparently, when compared to its $100 million cost.  But sci-fi buffs are a loyal film audience with eternal memories, and it is certain that this ambitious sci-fi production will continue to attract countless repeated viewings -- and income -- for the rest of the studios' and the filmmakers' natural lives.  Nobody loses on this one.  A sequel is hardly a big gamble if one invests long-term.    Regardless of that, director Phil Tippett has not only done an impressive job of directing his first major film, he has also done a very smart job of producing a generous portion of images large in scope and convincing in power within his spare budget.    Looking at the bug war scenes in the first act, you might easily not suspect there were any production restrictions at all.  Credit Mr. Tippett for that achievement.  In fact, there are moments that benefit from lessons learned in the first movie, which have added impact as a result.    Now for a few notes:  I would have liked to see the bug culture and biology expanded in new, logical ways.  I would like to have seen bug life-cycle mechanics which did not rehash ground covered by other unrelated movies -- what has been done and re-done in sci-fi productions as far back as ALIEN.    The creative possibilities for an intelligent multiped, exoskeleton, hive-bred civilization are unlimited.  There is no need at all for the writers or FX techs to resort to the over-used and tired gimmick of an alien climbing from one human's mouth to another human mouth, for example.    Nor do we need yet another script in which we revisit the old familiar premise of films from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS to THE HIDDEN to THE THING that anyone can be inhabited by an alien and still appear normal.  It has been done to death.  Let's move on and discard that whole much copied process.    I could tell you things about the way a crawdad captures and eats a minnow from the tail forward that would make your hair stand on end. There is plenty of fresh, untapped bug behavior to mine, and there is far too much writing talent involved with the STARSHIP TROOPERS series to need to use anything rehashed from any previous motion picture.   Still in all, Phil Tippett's feature debut as director is more than competent and particularly surprising for his facility with the actors.  I look forward to his future development as a director.    
 I strongly believe you must SWEAT SWEAT SWEAT to learn karate, instead of reading on your couch, and think you have mastered Karate. This is just another karate book only good for information.......I would like to see more philosphy type of book. 
 I'm reviewing this only to average down the overall rating.  The album isn't worth commenting on.  It's that bad 
 I was expecting this movie to be great considering this was the guy from Brotherhood of the Wolf. What a disappointment. I fast forward through alot but still couldn't bring myself to finish watching it. The plot is slow and the actions sequences look like a TV shows 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 and when it's bad, it's worse!  As a Pagan, I was really turned off by all the Christian ideology and preaching found in the book, BUT because it had some good, solid information, I bought it anyway. I also was quite offended how the author states towards the end about using "Biblical Discipline" and spells out "S-P-A-N-K-I-N-G". Ummm... excuse me, lady, but corporal punishment is O-U-T!  As a mother, I liked how the author spoke in her own words and expressed herself, and admitted her own faults. We all have them. I really tried to like the book, but I found myself glossing over so much crap and fluff, especially the repeated references to order from Bob Jones University! ROFL! ROFL! ROFL!   The Ultimate? Hardly 
 These don't fit my cabinets because the width between knobs is too large.  I'm not sure how, but if possible, verify the width on your cabinets against what these offer 
 I did not find this book helpful at all.  I guess I should have known better, but I thought maybe it would have one piece of useful information.  It didn't 
 They're ink tanks, so not much to say.  But I purchased them on 07/04/2006 and as of one month later...no delivery.  Amazon seems to have a stocking problem on this item 
 I bought this and this authours slap and pop books. Both are very dissapointing. The guitar tone on this cd is terrible, the examples are unclear and I cant hear what is being played. The guitar has a lot of effects on it, when I try to learn from the book I dont even know where to start 
 My main problem with this book is that the author makes sweeping statements and claims about the role of various forms of popular culture in various eras without providing any historical data or close analysis of any popular culture from those times. Instead, he promisciously cites a very broad range of theorists to back up his otherwise groundless assertions 
 This movie makes an attempt at showing a the plight of illegal immigrants but when you watch it you are only shown a glimpse of the trouble they cause. They cross through ranches, leaving litter, killing animals, provoking ranchers, causing crime and when they have trouble out there the US Taxpayer is expected to foot the bill. I get that these people are trying to find work (not in all instances) but you can't be overly sympathetic because they have a rotten deal - you have to respect the rights of US citizens. If this movie was going to be fair - they would have show a rancher and his family - show the fear, show the costs!! 
 Long on loathing. Boring, I fear. This trip was at somewhere I've never been, and I don't want to go there. A place beyond the event horizon. Who could care less about these people? Great title for a book, or a film, though. For some reason I've given it an extra star. I don't know why. Perhaps because it definitely belongs in anybody's collection of bizarre movies 
 The idea for the book was great, but the book was way too long, although the ending wasn't quite long enough. You shouldn't read this book until your 16 or 17, at least. It was way too confusing for me. Some parts of the book were more intersting than the others, and it was interesting to see into her life, but definately not a book to put on a young adults list 
 The 1 star is for the historical aspect of this book. Some very interesting info, especially on the early history of gold many thousands of years ago. But the recent history (late 1800's up to late 1990's) is so skewed that I almost could not finish it. It's ironic that Mr. Bernstein refers to gold on so many occasions as basically a useless piece of metal while extoling the virtues of paper currencies (mainly the Dollar) as the savior of the civilized world. To put it into perspective, that useless yellow metal, in the 6 years since the printing of this book has increased in value (measured by dollars) almost 140% (gold = $620/oz recently) while the greenbacks in my wallet have LOST 15% of their value in the same time. Gold doesn't pay any dividends but it holds its value a whole lot better than the constantly inflated dollar.     It's also interesting how the move to confiscate U.S. citizens gold in 1933 by FDR is glossed over and made to look almost as if it were a good thing. Yet no where is it mentioned that since that day the U.S dollar has decreased in value by 97% !!!! AND that the average income tax rate for the American worker has exploded in order to fund mushrooming government programs, U.S. public debt is well over 10 trillion dollars, the government debt is close to 15 trillion dollars and our trade deficit is approaching a trillion dollars! Meanwhile while China, India and Russia continue to add to their gold holdings, we continue to add to our debt, a debt that our childrens' children will not even be able to pay off. Gold kept us disciplined. Now, we are awash in debt and dollars. The dollar continues to fall while gold continues to hold it's value relative to it.     Remember that no fiat currency has ever lasted. Gold has and always will. I would like to see a follow up book with possibly a new chapter entitled "Got Gold?". 
 Initially unimpressed by the first chapter of the book, in which Freely provides a cursory summation of Byzantium's early history, I was amazed to find on page 13, the first of Chapter 2, that he mistakenly identified Mesembria (modern day Nesebar)as the Greek colony closest to the Bosphorus. It was in fact, and still is, Apollonia Pontika (modern day Sozopol), which was one of the earliest Greek foundations (late 7th century B.C.). The rest of the book is an assemblage of information, much of which will not be particulary useful to a visitor. The book's saving grace is an excellent bibliography for the reader to explore. For tourists, the "DK Eyewitness Travel Guide - Istanbul" is a far better companion; easier to carry, containing excellent color photographs and diagrams,and full of historical information 
 On Right Where You Want Me, teen pop star Jesse McCartney attempts to extend his fifteen minutes with a stab at rock maturity. Basically, this involves nicking Maroon 5's style and running with it. Unfortunately, the album's sound is dated and has been for some time.  The title track (and first single) will probably be a deserved semi-hit. It's the most immediate thing on the album and fits McCartney's thin, nasal voice. In fact, much of the album is full of retreads of the first song, though all are inferior. Worst of all are Right Back In The Water and Tell Her, or as I like to call them, Droopy Ballad #1 and Droopy Ballad #2. Neither of these songs have the bombast or vulnerability that superior teenage ballads exhibit. Better is Invincible, which tells the story of a fatal drinking-and-driving accident. Lyrically it's obvious, but at least McCartney seems to feel it. Less successful are Can't Let You Go and We Can Go Anywhere, a pair of atrociously detached rockers.   Jesse McCartney is better suited to Radio Disney fair. After all, Beautiful Soul and Because You Live (both off his major label debut) were legit, catchy pop hits. While they were undeniably bubblegum, they were also fun and urgent. Right Where You Want Me is neither. Instead it's a long, arduous collection of factory-pressed wannabe-rock that feels hollow and forgettable.  Key Tracks: Right Where You Want Me, Feelin' You, Invincibl 
 I have the Institutes and I have read with careful atention Calvin`s Doctrine of Salvation. He teaches pretty well some  christian truths. He uses the bible and the church fathers, but when Calvin gives his (or Luther`s) peculiar teachings, he shows how unchristian his doctrine really is by NOT quoting a single NT text or church father to support what is nothing more than an heretic view. Just to give an example: he teaches in this book that the good works of the christian stink, smell horrible, but Calvin doesn`t give a single quote from the NT or the fathers to support this view. His teaching is clearly anti biblical. One more: When he teaches about Righteousness he never quotes Matthew 5:20. In this text Jesus tells us that if our justice is not superior than the scribes' we won`t enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Justice for Matthew is good work of love for God and the needy (Mt 6:1). Calvin simply doesn`t quote this biblical text, and just read his commentary on his "Harmony of the Gospels" and you will see how in some 29 lines Calvin just run from the simple sense of this text, and that`s because Mt 5:20 goes against his doctrine (salvation by faith alone).  Calvin taught that salvation can`t be lost, even tough this doctrine wasn`t taught by the church fathers (not even by Augustine). Read Daniel Corner`s Conditional Security of the believer" Yes you will find in this book his classic insult to God: that He has predestined some people to hell. And Calvin`s use of violence to support his views is well known. Let`s reread the Bible without Calvin`s lens.  
 If you want a balanced, thoughtful background on the PRC's relationship to the US you will have to read this book in conjunction with something written by Maoist revolutionaries. From the first page the authors fail to provide any kind of serious analysis to provide a thinking reader something to ponder. Thankfully I received the book as a gift and didn't have to waste my own money on it 
 I own a strategy guide for every Final Fantasy game, and this one was sorely disappointing.  I think the only guide that has been worse than this is the FF9 'PlayOnline' joke (that no longer exists online).  The strategy guide leaves out several key elements of the game (such as how to find Aeris' limit break BEFORE disc 2), how you can reach certain areas, where to find items, who to have in your party in certain areas, etc.  The information was blatantly inaccurate or extremely confusing.  Some of the maps are mislabeled and look more like a random assortment of screenshots than a coherent guide.  All in all, don't waste your money on this guide.  You're better off buying the Brady version instead 
 Great photos but ponderous writing.  Page 83 excerpt, "The architects clearly enjoyed the possibilities of this experimental architectural archeology whereby a fundamentalist concept of authenticity is replaced by an inclusive and imaginative view of historical processes.&quot 
 She seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i.e. much of today's pentecostalism/charasmatics i.e. the toronto/brownsville blessing (a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic) and hollywood.   In studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine. It was just get saved and jesus loves you. A cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow.  
 This movie is a disaster. There is not one single memorable performance by the cast of "stars". If you want to see a little boy happily running to school, get hit by a car, walk home injured and die, have at it.  There is a reason that this movie is deeply discounted by Amazon. Criterion is probably losing money on this release and they desire it. They should be is ashame 
 Shanks's book provides a good argument for corporate election, which is, however, unconvincing. His answers to some of the proof-texts for Calvinism are very weak. For a theological defense of Calvinism, see Calvinism and  Evangelical Arminianism by Girardeau. For answers to Shank's proof texts,  see The Cause of God and Truth by John Gill. For a strong argument for the  Calvinist doctrine of the sovereignty of God, read "The Sovereignty of  God" by Pink. For a refutation of Shank's theory of the atonement, and  his proof-texts against particular redemption, see "The Death of  Death" by John Owen. I commend Shank for writing against what he  considers to be error.However, I found his arguments weak 
 Before I saw this movie I was warned that is was anti-Christian and that the writers of the screenplay didn't have a clue as to what following Christ is really all about.  After seeing the movie I am convinced of the latter but only somewhat of the former.   Mandy Moore does a great job playing a legalistic, "church-lady" type named Hilary,  who goes beyond "witnessing" in her attempts at converting others by using crisis intervention tactics--like blocking the hallways with her and her friends, or attempting to kidnap the subject and throwing him/her into their van for treatment.  For Hilary, Christianity is all about behavior modification.  She lacks heart winds up with bitterness.  Her only hope at the end comes from her wheelchair bound brother, a nonbeliever, who offers to help her with her problems.  One can only assume that rather than correcting her misperceptions of Jesus, he will instead try to deprogram her of her faith.   Hilary's nemesis, who she constantly tries to convert, is Cassandra, played by Eva Amurri.  Cassandra, a Jewish girl determined not to convert, brings to mind Matthew 13:19.  She has heard the Word and "understandeth it not" as a person who received the "seed" by the wayside.  She becomes a hero in the end for having a big heart, though she still chooses the earthly path rather than the spiritual one, thinking she only needs to rely on herself.   Mary, played wonderfully by Jena Malone for her innocence, seems to turn against God a bit too easily when in trouble (see Matthew 13:21).  Blaming God when it was she who forgot to bring protection along seems very shortsighted for a girl with such strong willed faith.  But many young Christians do feel persecuted when they don't get what they pray for, a sign of spiritual immaturity.   The problem with this movie is that no one has spiritual maturity, including the writers of the screenplay.  Even the most sinful pastor will answer "YES" when asked by a young gay teenager, banned from prom night, if Jesus still loves him.  This one doesn't know what to say.  There are no answers given to the audience of this film, most of whom are young people looking for answers.  So I will give a short one here.   Saint Augustine said something that at first sounds irresponsible when not fully understood.  He said "Love God, and then do as you please."  What he meant is that when we really love Jesus intensely for who He is and what he sacrificed for us, our hearts will change.  Sinful behavior we used to commit no longer has the same appeal to us as before.  Being obedient to God brings us pleasure when we have true love and devotion to Christ.  We are still sinners but no longer by desire--not perfect but forgiven.  Would it have been so difficult to include just one character at a Christian school who mentions this?  The difficulty lies in finding screenwriters in Hollywood who have a clue about it.  Don't get me wrong.  All of the characters in this movie were essential!  But they forgot the most essential of all 
 I'm embarassed that I read this all the way through. The language/expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff. I don't live with people who talk like that, and I don't understand the purpose: "sophistication"? To my mind, the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with @%#&*s.  
 The shelf life for this brand of hatemongering is very short. And obviously Michelle knows this since she churns out error-filled polemics almost as fast as Ann Coulter.  The only people who buy, let alone read, this drek are already singing in Michelle's ever-dwindling choir.  Have fun ranting, folks. 
 I got the impression that Rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor. It was superficial, with such helpful hints as "People come in all sizes and shapes," and "People with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly." I didn't need to read her book to figure those out. Her logic is also flawed. She states that, "Doctors touch patients, not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients." Did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them - not because of any power status? Using the book to promote her feminist beliefs, numerous typographical errors, and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer 
 In Defense of Secular Humanism is a collection of essays written by Paul Kurtz, mostly in reaction to allegations leveled against secular humanism (and humanism in general) by the Religious Right and other fundamentalist Christian organizations in the United States.  And therein lies the chief problem: it's a collection of essays that are almost totally focused on one central concern. Whereas many other essay collections by other authors tend to cover wide ranges of concerns (anything from war, to ethics, to religion, to sports), Kurtz's collection is focused almost entirely on answering allegations by his opponents.  And since his opponents had a habit of making the same allegations again, and again, and again, much of this book is Kurtz writing the same responses again, and again, and again.  To sum the problem up, there's a heck of a lot of repition in this book.  Of course, there are several good essays, and some excellent ones. Kurtz's "Principle of Tolerance Reaffirmed", "Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle", and "The Democratic Ethic" are very thought-provoking works to read. However, much of the book delves into seemingly mindless repition and even vitrolic rhetoric, which is, in my opinion, unbecomming of a person of Kurtz's intellectual capabilities.   Bear in mind that I do have some biases on this subject. This was my first introduction to humanism, and it's a very poor book for a first exposure. If you're like I was, and looking for something to introduce the ideas of Humanism to you, read "The Philosophy of Humanism," by Lamont.   Ultimately, I would hesitate to buy this book if I were you. If you're like me, and willing to spend the money to add this to your collections (and read the occasional very interesting articles within), go ahead. However, overall the book is intellectually unstimulating, and probably not worth most people's money. These essays just weren't meant to be put together 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 When you have lost weight, it's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off. Whenever they have heard me tell my story, read my blog or book, or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle, one question invariably has come up from time to time:   "What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?"  My initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this:  "That's absolutely crazy! There's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method."  I did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there. But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.  Little did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about. It's called The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller.  The CAD diet, as it is referred to, makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance. Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less, that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.  If people think the Atkins diet is restrictive, then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet:  BREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat. LUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.  You are NOT allowed to eat any bread, fruit, milk, juice, and most starchy vegetables. Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda. You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.  Sound appealing, anyone? Hmmm? I suppose if that's all there was to this diet, then NOBODY would do it. But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in.   DINNER: Eat equal amounts of protein, vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount, but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame. You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your "reward" meal.  How's that for incentive? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line! Who wouldn't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT?!  Well, I'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a DAILY basis. I caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial "planned splurge" meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss. However, the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge!!! What's up with that?  We can blame this on Dr. Rachael, who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet. She became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat (ostensibly to help herself in the process, too). She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then, like most of us would, ate to her heart's content whatever she wanted for supper. The next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds.  Thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale, she tried it again the next day, skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again, she lost another pound. She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day.  The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet. The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether. They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict. It will make them crave their poison even more!  That's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day. This process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one, and the Hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people.  I still can't get around the fact that you don't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds. Sure, they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day, but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER!  There's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion. I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off. Since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the CAD diet, it would literally drive me insane even if there was that "reward" meal at the end of the day!  Wanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict? Click here to take the 10-question Carbohydrate Addict's Test. I scored a 2, which means "You do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted." No kidding, ya think?  Dr. Jonny Bowden, author of Living The Low-Carb Life, examined the CAD diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works.  "While it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese, it's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin, as the Hellers hypothesize--in fact, the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response."  Furthermore, Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program, stating "it's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate."  While The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off, I still have my reservations about this program. I think I'll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day 
 The information presented in this book is amazing.  The economics of baseball are hardly talked about.  There are some things that go on behind the scenes that most of us don't know about.  It was fascinating to find out about this, but it got to be too much for me to handle.  I ended up being bored with it in the end and that is why I gave it two stars.  I also disagree with some of Zimbalist's theories on how to reform baseball.  He is not open to any other ways, and I should know since I met him once for a seminar 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 There is a lot of buisness talk and a lot of action in this book, but it is just so far fetched that I could hardly read it.  First of all, I can't believe that Cy hated her so much just because she lied about her age?  Also, Meredith never stuck up for herself when she was being accoused of theft?  She just ups and runs away, pregnant and alone with nothing?  Also, the biggest part of this story that I could not believe was that Henry just meetS her and the next thing you know she is Head of an international company.  Just like that.  I found myself wishing that Meredith got together with Mr. Smith (Her sons babysitter/bodygaurd).  I was also looking forward to reading the scene where Cy realizes that Meredith's son was his and his own Mother was responsible for everything that has happened, but on his way to confront Meredith he gets in a car wreck and instead of her being angry at him for all he and his mother put her through, she is worried sick about him and is all sappy and forgiveable with him?  I would not reccommend this book unless you like stories that the woman never sticks up for herself and gets walked on even up to the end 
 I found the narrator less "gripping", as one reviewer stateshere, than heavy handed with a laughable accent--sounded like a cross between Dracula and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The narration is actually very boring and uninformative. I give this two stars because it does have some color footage I have not seen before. 
   They work for the price guess I was hoping for more.  They do not get very loud and do not block out the sound very well.  In a noisy environment I cannot even hear what I am listening to at max volume on my zune.  
 Shame on Keith Whitelam.  He's a trained scholar who ought to know better than to perpetrate something like this.  We readers do not deserve this substitution of crude political propaganda for something of academic value 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 Remember the style of music that came out in the late 70's called Punk?  The pioneers of this type of music were bands such a Clash, The Sex Pistols, The Ramones and the Talking Heads.  The style becamse somewhat funk-influenced to the gut-wrentching hardcore metal influenced sounds of The Dead Kennedies and Ministry.  Even Social Distortion had their own little sound to offer.  This is how it went through the 80's.  Yet, after the who Nirvana-mania that saved music from Whitesnake and Warrent, Punk, as well as many other sounds, seemed lost until...  Green Day comes around with "Dookie."  This continued the punk sound into what we know today.  So in the words of Oasis:  "Where did it all go wrong."  It's not that this sounds on it's own is bad.  When Blink 182 first came out, they had a lot of fun to offer.  But gawd, where do we draw the line?  After that, we had ( in no particular order) Sum 41, New Found Glory, My Chemical Romance, Showoff, and jeez, I could go on forever.  They all sound so much alike.  Still they were once tolerable.  But with simple plan, (sigh), enough is enough.  I can't even tell the difference sometimes between these guys and Bowling For Soup.  And I don't easily confuse bands.  Really, though, these guy call themselves Punk.  But last time I checked, Punk was about rebellion, Anarchy, disatisfaction with where humanity is going, all that stuff.  Ex Sex Pistols "Anarchy In The UK" or Ramones "I'm Against It."  Now Listen to some of the titles off this:  "I'm Just A Kid," "God Must Hate Me," "I'd Do Anything."  Difference?  You'd have to be blind not to see one.  These guys have jumped on the "poser" bandwagon that every other "punk" band on a major label has jumped on, and thus, mainstream punk is doing the same thing heavy Metal is 
 It said Woody Guthrie and Joseph Smith were going to hell.  That's pretty good criteria for an awful book 
 This story is written in sort of a fanciful prose fairy tale like style, but that's where the niceness ends.  I would say that Mona Gray suffers from extreme Obsessive-Comulsive Disorder.  She has this completely bizarre habbit of knocking on wood when events become too much for her to handle, she eats strange things when she can't handle her real life, she buys herself an axe, yes an axe, as a birthday present and what happens with that axe is almost too much to take in.    It seems though thst poor Mona is doomed from the start.  Her favorite Math teacher/hardware store owner makes wax number necklaces and wears a different number depending on his mood.  Mona's father has all but given up on life and has started dying from the outside in. Every character in this book it seems is suffering from some sort of mental illness and it forces me to think: What is wrong with the author?  It turns out that the reviews I have read of this book make it seem much more mainstream than it really is.  The fact that Mona and her family have quit nearly everything that they've tried and it seems like they live in another universe come in a distant second to the warped reality of this book. 
 Boy, this DVD is just a jumble of old episodes, which are fine. But, it's just not cohesive overall. Feels very disjointed when watching it.  The good thing is my 2 year old loves watching it. She only learned "m" and "u" from this overpriced DVD, but at least she likes watching it.  I must say, I was afraid she wouldn't like "Meet The Letters" after watching this DVD countless times, but she does (I highly recommend Meet The Letters, if you want your young ones to actually learn). Oh, she could call out all the letters after watching "Meet The Letters" for about 2 weeks. Is it because she watched the jumbled "Jungle" for about 3 weeks earlier? Maybe. But, she sure heck didn't call out the letters while watching it (other than "M" and "U" as mentioned).  This is a good DVD that entertains. I would've actually gave it at least 3 stars if it weren't for the price ($[...] B&N), considering that they only had to create those few new scenes with Elmo, Zoey and Telly.  
 Doubtless going to rattle a few cages here, on *both* sides: the people who consider his stuff impermissibly naughty, and the people who wax rhapsodic about this particular work.  But it has to be said.  Britain, the land that pioneered imprisonment without charge before we did, the land that criminalizes self-defense against burglars in your own home, is also the land without a First Amendment; and this has seemingly scared Mr. Hamilton into self-censoring and mutilating his own product.  This is a first-rank tragedy, as he is arguably the best-known and most highly respected photographer of this entire genre, and therefore the most likely to prevail in a frontal assault against the philistinism which equates nude photography with pornography.  Instead, however, he has in this volume essentially raised the white flag and abandoned *nude* photography in favor of topless photos which won't arouse the ire of the British police.  An astonishing number of his photos are awkwardly cropped for legal, rather than aesthetic reasons, so what was clearly shot as an integral figure study gets published as an amputated torso.  This phenomenon was *not* present in his early works, including his films and his photos for the Spanish edition of "Playboy"--it manifested itself only when the world got uniquely psychotic about "child pornography".  Even in the USA, where a 17-year-old Marine who carries a machine gun for a living can be considered a "child" if photographed wrongly, Sally Mann and Jock Sturges haven't thrown in the towel (or draped the model in it ;-).  Nor, of course has Bourboulon or Ionesco.  So I say:  Boycott!  The guy's got a right to protect his hide, of course, and even Galileo recanted when the Inquisition threatened to murder him for saying the Earth goes around the Sun.  But would you spend your money on a book that says it's the other way around? 
 horrid movie. i can't believe how disappointed i am in this anime. i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad. but it's not. the little girl annoyed me so much. i just can't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her. omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie. can't stop ranting yeah... for those who haven't seen it, you might like it like everybody seems to but... i would not recommend it at al 
 Aircraft design from a Cranfield University perspective ONLY. Siginificant aircraft and designs are not discussed. Don't waste your money.

 It's sad to see a band with this much talent play a bunch of poppish songs that sound like rejects from singer/songwriters or the Dixie Chicks. You'd really never know this was an Irish band. I'll be trying to unload this CD ASAP

 This is the only book I've read about poker that I haven't liked. The whole book just tells over and over again how good Antonio is at poker 
 The sling doesn't really do much...  the underwear is sized very small, so make sure to order your size accordingly.  When they say low profile, they really mean it.  If you really want underwear with a sling, go buy some elastic and put into your current tighty whities.    
 The play was relatively entertaining and has a promising beginning, but Higgins' infuriating and incesant bullying doesn't change, and quickly becomes tiresome. You keep expecting the characters to evolve, to grow into something better, or at least different, and none of them really do. Doolittle is still lazy, Pickering always the gentlemen, and most frustratingly, Eliza and Henry are never truly able to understand one another. In the beginning I was an immediate fan, but as the story continued I grew more and more dissatisfied, and by the end I felt that it was a complete waste of time 
 As amazing as it would have been to finally watch the famed MURDER SHE WROTE/MAGNUM P.I. crossover as it originally aired -- and, as the packaging would lead you to believe, should also appear in this box set -- they included the WRONG VERSION of the "Magnum" episode. When it was originally created, they shot the episode with two endings: The "to be continued" ending for the crossover, and then a self-contained ending for syndication purposes. The DVD packagers grabbed the wrong version! AAAARGH! This is an awfully expensive package for such a sloppy mistake 
 Bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago (three computers at home) and worked ok- no viruses. Then I did what I thought was a clean install of XP Pro from XP Home on one of the computers, and it carried over a lot of garbage from XP Home I wanted to get rid of, but that's another issue (clean install?}. After installing XP Pro, I was warned I didn't have virus protection and so I tried installing my NAV again. You would think at some point NAV would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a Windows upgrade, and that the NAV was legitimate. Nope- fatal error and computer lock-up, which I was able to survive. No contact opportunity at the Symantec web site.  I simply opted for Microsoft's recommended anti-virus software- Computer Associates. Another twenty. Then I had a heck of a time uninstalling NAV, which wouldn't install and now wouldn't uninstall. What a waste of time and money. Who creates these viruses? We certainly know who benefits from them.  There is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout. This little note means diddily, but thanks to Amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something.   
 This book has about one or two mildly interesting parts, but it reminds me too much on Jumanji. This book was recommended to me by a friend, and after reading the book, i wanted to hit him! This book was hideously boring and confusing as times. Once i put it down, it fealt like i was taking a VERY heavy burden off of my shoulders. I reccomend that you do not read this book 
 One of the things a prudent business owner should seek to avoid when adding to the library are books that are the same garbage they've already read somewhere else. This book is a quick and dirty version of several other author's materials, rehashed and reworded, with some quotes from people who aren't high on the list of those one would want to emulate. Plus, anyone that quotes Nancy Langdon Jones on the first page as an "expert" on how to build a successful practice cannot be taken seriously. Dick Koreto has never been a financial planner, nor has he been a successful business owner. His selection of so-called "experts" shows how little he really knows about what it takes to survive and thrive in the craft of advice. Save your money and time, and keep browsing for more suitable material 
 I just want to say, this book is BAD.  The characters have no change and/or development that doesn't make them meaner, cruder people, and the whole book is FAR too shapeless and confusing.  The main character is a boy  that goes against his parents' wishes to go to church, who eventually  cusses and has few associates.  His remarks against girls were unpleasant  to me as a female reader, and his desciption of Preacher Man was of a guy  who sweated and had freaky eyes.  Talk about pointless.  This book is a  disgrace to literature 
 There's plenty of Star Trek websites that feature schematics of starships featured in this book.  Most of them provide more information than published.  A Google search will turn up these sites and you'll enjoy the lot of them 
 Typical O'Rourke drivel. Heres how it goes.  PJ gets Rolling Stone to pay to send him to Lebanon, Panama (circa Noriega) and some other places where they have lots of guns and bad manners and little of anything else, in the hopes that he will get drunk enough to wander out from the hotel bar, see some "bad stuff" and come up with something funny to say about it. His humor is pointed and well placed at times. Most of the time though he, merely, uses the humor to set up some libertarian screed. Heavy reliance on Cato institute,intern-toadies(who fact check, research and do the academic heavy lifting) at times gives O'Rourke the appearance of knowing his arse from a hole in the ground....do not be fooled. PJ is a Hunter Thompson wannabe, but who lacks HT'S gonads. SKIP IT 
 Seems like Kurupt duz really good with out DDDDDaz!  Throw Back Muzic'86 was the only good hit on this whole Death Row Album, and you can't even sample it!?  Like Eazy, "I be like Scrappy Loco, cause Kurupt be yellin' Long Beach Rollin' 6-0 Blood & Puppy Pound Crip? Really Doe!  Nutz On Ya Chin, All Up in this Philly Hoe!" -Eazy-E (Wut Would U Do?)  Anywayz, Against The Grain really is watered down compared to Kurupt's previous albums!  Death Row Records present day, Petey Pablo (Blast!), Young Eastwood (Blast!), Suga Knight (Blast!), and that wanna be Locc Kurupt (Blast! Blast!), he was never 2pac's friend like Snoop Doggy Dogg was anywayz!  Plus MC Eiht, Outlawz, Coolio, RBX and Kurupts old' partner DDaz has better solo albums than Kurupt!  This album is a disgrace to West Coast hip hop, so ya know whats good for ya! (LOL!

 I thought the book would have been more detailed. There are very beautiful pictures in it but as for the theory there's almost nothing. I would have liked more specific information about visual merchandising: for example how to create  good window cases or in store displays. Also a defined visual merchandising strategy could have been mentioned.   Overall, I'm a quite disappointed with the book. 
 While O'Brien seems to really know his stuff, and the book covers a vast array of material, it's just too darn wordy. His sentence structure, and word usage are awkward. Many of the terms he uses are NEEDLESSLY large and difficult to understand. He uses terms like 'tactical planning', 'proactive and interactive', and the like with out even explaining what he means. Many of his sentences have fillers and are full of redundancies.  The simple fact is that text books that are well written make learning the material easier. I implore the author to fix this book.  This is a poorly written book that has a great deal of valuable knowledge 
 WELL,GUYS JESSICA SIMPSON IS THR WORST OF THE WORST.SHE SINGS AS BADLY AS SHE LOOKS.THIS CD IS VERY,VERY,VERY BAD.AVOID AND WAIT FOR THE NEW IRON MAIDEN CD WHICH SHOULD BE OUT SHORTLY. 
 I bought the CD because I was looking for piano music and this one was highly recommended by reviewers. Well, it sure is one boring piece of work! I somehow missed reference on the music style. So, to you all who may be doing the same mistake: it is a blues music for bars. Nothing great nor special about it really. It has something specifically American about it that I find difficult to relate to: too common, too simple, too simpleminded, too shortcoming. Sorry, but using piano for instrument doesn't make the music special; the melodies could have been played on harmonic or accordion instead and sold as folk-music 
 This book represents everything that is wrong in music theory education.  This book approaches music as an abstract entity even though it provides many examples and exercises.  It tries to compartmentalize different aspects of music, like harmony, melody, rhythm and form.  I don't think it's the authors' fault entirely.  This is a book on tonal harmony.  It has become the standard textbook for music theory in the United States.  This is extremely misguided since it will give the student an extremely incomplete understanding of how music works.  For example, counterpoint is not taught in this book.  Counterpoint has been considered essential for the serious musician for the past 500 years.  All the different aspects of music mentioned above are wholly intertwined.  Any approach that seperates them misses the point.    This book also puts too much emphasis on harmony as a vertical phenomenon.  Most people experience music as a horizontal phenonmenon and I haave found that approaches to music theory that treats music as such has had much more success.  This goes back to why counterpoint is so essential in music theory.  Learning harmony through an approach that pays attention to how melody, rhythm, and counterpoint affect harmony is the most honest and least troublesome way of learning how music works.  This may explain why many have had trouble with this book(I had for 5 years).  You'll know how to name things such as chords and form after completing this book, but it won't help you understand how a piece works.  It focuses more on nomenclature than on syntax and function.  There are a slew of books that will give the music student a more complete picture of theory.  Most importantly, these more integrated methods will give better tools to understand the music they may be performing and/or studying.  These books include Leo Kraft's Gradus, Aldwell and Schachter's Harmony and Voice Leading, Horton and Ritchey's Harmony Through Melody, Siegmeiter's Harmony and Melody, and to a lesser extent Forte's Tonal Harmony in Concept and Practice.    I am an active conductor and I feel I have a much stronger grasp of music after having been taught a more honest and comprehensive way of studying music and this was only after years of deprogramming what I had learned through the Kostka and Payne.  I am still struggling with this issue.  If you're serious about music, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK 
 Considering the reviews I've read thus far, this cookbook is comprable to eggplant: either you love it or you hate it. I am an avid cookbook user, and adventurous in my tastes. It seems as though every time I went to this book for a recipe, I ended up somewhere else. The recipes are just weird. I think in the five years I owned it, I only used it twice. I really gave it a shot. I find the title wildly ironic considering I received another slow cooker cookbook for Christmas and already see dozens of recipes I want to try. Never the case with this volume 
 The material in this book is so poorly organized that I had to visit javasoft.com for a much better introduction to JMS. The author has an interesting way of presenting his ideas. He starts out with code examples without clearly explaining the JMS concepts employed in them. The code examples are so lengthy that one is left flipping back and forth between pages correlating the explanation, which is very meagre and superficial, with the code snippets. The chat application implemented by the author, instead of clarifying the concepts, only adds to the confusion. Also chapters 7,8 and 9 are somewhat peripheral to JMS programming.. 
 Like many CD's in the Drum and Bass genre, Balance of the Force offers nothing new.  The songs not only sound like each other, they sound like a lot of D&B records.  I get bored midway through the third song every  time, if not earlier 
 **Note** Certain plot details are revealed in my review. However, major plot points, twists, deaths, etc. are not divulged.  Stage 1: Development Two scientists conduct research and experiments on anger and excessive aggression. They attempt to develop a cure. Warren the main scientist is quite wreckless, while Clive is much more cautious although we learn of his own history with domestic abuse. It is the last straw for Clive when he learns that they have created the exact opposite of what they intended...a rage virus. He refuses to cooperate any longer while Warren loses control of the situation and an infected Chimp escapes.  My notes: I only had one real problem with this chapter. It was confusing in the beginning. There were 4 characters talking along with narrations and it was hard to keep the dialog and characters separate, mainly due to the way bubbles were placed or how characters were drawn or in some instances just shadows. After going over it several times, it became clear although it shouldn't take multiple readings to comprehend what is going on in just the first couple pages. Warren is a corrupt murderer, Clive has anger control issues and a history with domestic violence...why exactly would these two want to rid the world of rage, when they make a good contribution of anger and aggression themselves? Perhaps fame and fortune...perhaps poor storytelling?  Stage 2: Outbreak A family is having a picnic to celebrate the mother's birthday. Peaceful enough...until the little brother spies a monkey in a tree, and it doesn't want to play. Things happen very quickly and sacrifices must be made.  My notes: Things happen fast...WAY too fast. Characters have no time to mourn loss, nor do they seem to even take notice of the death of a family member...there is almost no character development at all and it would have had a much deeper impact if it actually gave you a chance to care about the characters. Characters make sacrifices when there was obviously other ways of handling the situation.  Stage 3: Decimation A lone survivor in a seemingly empty London hunts down any remaining infected and makes some observations on their behavior and comes to the conclusion that they only attack the non-infected because of the use of products such as deodorant and perfumes. When he runs into another survivor, he takes it as a threat and vows to defend his territory...or HIS city as he says repeatedly, and he decides to put his theory to good use.  My notes: I can't stress how ridiculous this story is. The "revelations" on the deodorant just doesn't makes sense when you think about it. It is stressed how quickly the virus spreads, and newly infected obviously were wearing such products right before they became infected. It may make more sense now that the infected are rotting away, but it's not nearly as genius of a discovery as they make it seem. The guy does something crazy and unjustified...to the point of being completely unbelievable.  Stage 4: Quarantine The previous 3 chapters come together. Now under quarantine, the characters start to question the motives of their once thought protectors, and ultimately decide that they are in danger by staying under quarantine. A plan must be carried out...  My Notes: Another story where the characters' actions are ridiculous and unbelievable. Why would you flee where you are being protected, where are you going to go? It would be different if they had some sort of insight that would lead to them thinking they were in danger, but that wasn't the case. The previous three chapters all come together and very sloppily so, and ends very downbeat.  Bonus: Stage 3 (Text Only) There is also a text-only version of Chapter 3 for some reason at the end, which adds considerable thickness to the book, but doesn't add any actual content. It is interesting to see how a comic book is written before the artwork is done. The text describe how panels are to look, it's sort of like reading a screenplay.  Conclusion: The characters do some pretty crazy things, with little justification, that on top of the lack of any character development really breaks the deal for me and I can't say that I give a recommendation. Perhaps for 5 bucks...but not the 20 I paid. This graphic novel took all of about 10 minutes to read...That comes out to 2 bucks a minute!  If you are looking for some sort of deep insights behind the movie's story or to bridge the first movie and the sequel you may be disappointed. None of the characters from either movie made an appearance or were mentioned in the slightest way.  It is claimed to bridge the two movies...I went into this thinking it may tell what happened to past survivors and that it would bring me right up to the setup for the sequel 28 Weeks Later...I was wrong on all accounts, but this is not why I regret purchasing this. It is because of the poor storytelling and horrid development of the characters. It tells you very little of what you don't already know, and it doesn't really bring you to the beginning of the sequel. It could have very well been written years ago without any knowledge of 28 Weeks Later. I actually was much more impressed by the radical alternate ending storyboards on the 28 Days Later DVD.. 
 This is all around a pretty mediocre, uninspired exposition of quantum field theory.  More recent works by Weinberg and Peskin & Schroder, for example, are far more coherent and elegant 
 I like Domar's book but it's just not very fresh.  The Woman's Comfort  Book by Jennifer Louden and other books proclaimed this same message years  ago - and with more style and detail.  But I do love hearing it from  Harvard 
 This dreary account of a foul-mouthed adulterer who consistently makes the wrong choices might remind some of other tragic characters in great fiction, such as the protagonist in An American Tragedy or in  Crime and Punishment or Madame Bovary.  But the difference here is that Bob Dubois never learns, he repeatedly does the dumb thing, whether it is adultery or use of dope or abusing his wife or his poor innocent children.  One can hardly help being disgusted by a man who does not seem to have a brain in his body.  Only a moron would break all the windows in his own car when he is short of money for his wife and kids, or wreck his home, or booze and do dope when he does not know how to pay for necessary care for his child.  As for all the stuff about voodoo this may be interest to some but to me was a bore.  Surely the account of the Haitians' plight is distressing, but it helps to make this book a depressing one.  Frankly I was glad when I finished this pretentious and not well-written book, and thought Dubois got what he asked for and deserved 
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 "The Accidental" by first-time Scottish novelist Ali Smith has to be one of the most irritating books I've read in a very long time.  It's so modern, it's really hard to tell what happened or why you should care about it.  This book won the Whitbread Novel Award.  According to another website, the Whitbread Award lost its sponsor and ceased to exist the same year.  Would it be fair to label this book as the one that killed the Whitbread Award?   The jacket also labels this book as a finalist for the Man Booker Prize whose website says that they award "the very best in contemporary fiction."  For me a requirement of the very best fiction is to be able to affect the reader in a positive way.  My only positive is that I finally got to the end of a dreadful book; & no, it did not get better.  Eve Smart is a novelist.  I usually try to avoid books where writers write about writers.  It's like a movie about movie stars or a song about songwriting -- it seems quintessentially self-indulgent.  Who knows what happens to Eve at the end of the book?  Why is she in some lady's house near the Grand Canyon?  Is it just to present another character as irritatingly self-absorbed as the main character?  Why is Eve unconcerned about her children?  Why does she see her dead mother floating above the Grand Canyon when this wasn't a book about her parents?  Wouldn't it have been more interesting to have her be eaten by a mountain lion?   Michael is Eve's husband.  He's a university professor that sleeps with his students.  His wife Eve knows and doesn't care.  Are they progressive people because they sleep around?  Is this supposed to make us care about them?  What is the effect of their loose behavior on their two children?  Do we care or applaud when Michael gets fired?    Astrid is the youngest child.  She is going through typical adolescent behaviors.  Yes, she is one of the most real of the characters, but she doesn't change throughout the book.  She gets mad at her mother for not being home and refuses to speak to Eve when she calls on the phone.  Astrid was right to be mad at Eve, but so what?  Magnus, the son, was the most interesting character to me simply because he loses his virginity in a church.  It's a bit of a mixed message from author Ali Smith.  What does it say about the church?  Is the message that "The Accidental" is man because there is no God proved because the church is empty?  Who knows?  Amber shows up as the family summers in Suffolk or Norfolk as Eve tries to write.  She buddies up with Astrid smashing her expensive camera.  She has sex with Magnus.  She insults Eve and gives her a knee massage.  She kisses Eve on the lips, right before Eve leaves for the Grand Canyon.  She ignores Michael.  Who is Amber?  Why is she in the book?  Magnus tells Astrid he knows who Amber is after she's disappeared, but Smith fails to let the readers know.  Is this a puzzle?  An illusion?  A nightmare?  Then when the family returns home, their house has been completely stripped.  Who did that?  What's the point?    I did not care for Smith's repetitious use of pages of short sentences.  It doesn't further the story.  It basically just says, "Look at me.  I can write in short sentences."  However, it was enough to have her awarded the Whitbread Novel Award.  I didn't mind the poetry.  I liked it because I could get through the book faster.  To what point it was there, I cannot say.  Perhaps you will be more modern than I and not particularly care if a story makes sense or whether there is anybody about which to care.  For me, this is an award-winning dud.  Taxi!                
 While comedian Al Franken is normally quite humorous, this novel was a bit dull. There's very little plot and after awhile every page seems like the one before it. Sure, there's the occasional funny part, but overall this book is not worth reading. Quite frankly, it's just stupid. If it didn't have Al's name on the cover it is very doubtful anyone would pick this up. If you're looking for something humorous read The Idiot Girl's Guide to Action and Adventure or The Bear Went Over the Mountain 
 If in reference for gods and goddesses, this is not the most informative book. I would have given it 1 star, but there were some decent illustrations, which is the only reason it gets 2 stars. It really reads like a very boring textbook, and doesn't go into too many gods and goddesses. It gives a lot of history about the ideas in celtic dieties, but not too much into specific gods and goddesses. Read at your own risk 
 I belive that the author of this book is blaming society, especially Universities, a little too much.  In the beginning when he makes this assertion that Universites are racist he basis it on the astute obervation  that since there a few African Americans in the Universities that they are  racist or something like that.  Furthmore since the Military has more  African Americans it is a better instiution.  Here is a better explanation.   Universities are a lot more selective and thus can choose from the entire  population.  The Army will take anyone it can get its hands on. I just did  not like the Authors atitutde that the whole is racist. Furthermore he  knows nothing about music.  I love when he writes white soldiers are  listening to more black music and he uses Heavy Metal and Rock n Roll, both  white music!  In fact Heavy Metal is white protest music against Black  music!  Do some research or think before writting a book 
 Really. I followed Will since his start-up with From Now On and bought this second CD on the enthusiasm of the first release. Nothing related. While in the first album he succesfully attempted to create a new style thanks to his partciular voice and the result was a brand new album with interesting pieces (included a Beatles success), this second album was only a comemrcial return. Believe me, dancing songs wiht no heart, no passion, no melodies. If you want to "try" Will, listen to the previous recording. Leave this one to the non-suvccess of public and critics. Cia 
 Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud 
 I am a Navy Wife of four years facing my first deployment as a wife and I found this book to be the corniest thing I've ever read. EVER.  The "comical" stories everyone seems to be gushing over sound like they were pulled right out of a dusty old Reader's Digest. I didn't find the book to be informative and I found the definition section of the book to be incredibly trite and boring.   Example: Term Active Duty, Military Speak: Actively serving and deployable. Spouse Speak: This means your address is written in pencil in address books.  Dear God. How incredibly lame. Military members move. Yes. It's true. We ALL know that. Civilians know this. EVERYONE knows this. This poor attempt at humor is dull and over-used.  I didn't learn ANYTHING from this book and would NOT recommend this to anyone  SERIOUSLY looking for information or advice about military life or deployments. You can get USEFUL information by going to your local Fleet and Family Support Center or attending a pre-deployment brief. 
 One of the things I enjoy about reading is that I can take something from a book and carry it with me....some insight or food for thought. This book has nothing to savor in it's story. I don't like the Mother, who is never  true to herself. I really disliked the older daughter character, she needs  to grow-up and since she is 40 I doubt she ever will. The younger daughter  held the story for a while, but she falls into the TV business without any  prior talent...unbelievable at best. Morality is passe throughout and so is  this book, folks 
 I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie.  I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found.  Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe.  I guess it's a little late to complain now 
 What does WILD THINGS 2 have going against it from the get-go: A) No Denise Richards  B) No name actors  C)Being a crappy direct-to-video sequel  D)No Denise Richards NAKED . . .   What is wrong with WILD THINGS 2 after the fact:   A)A script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew  B)ONE sex scene -- A (weak) threesome, one of the few things even linking this to the original C)Sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked (leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot) . . . Wait let me play that again!  If I seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an EROTIC THRILLER.  Did I mention no Denise Richards? 
 I thought this would be the perfect table for an odd space in my office.  That might have been the case if I could have figured out how to put it together.  In the hardware packet I had too many of some pieces and not enough of others.  There were many things wrong with the instructions which were far from "step by step."  Some of the hardware did not match the pictures in the instructions.  The same was true for where holes were drilled in some of the wooden parts.  I called the number on the front of the instructions for assistance and got passed around to many people who weren't much help.  I finally gave up and sent it back.  I can say that the Amazon return process gets 5 stars!  I then got lucky and found the perfect table for my odd space at a local liquidation store which I was able to put together myself in about half an hour 
 This has be one of the worst movies ever made. The prolonged slow motion fighting scenes, the sentimental music, the pathetic apperance of Anthony Hopkins playing the cliched older wise man. All these things combined produce strong vomit reflexes in my gut. When Tom Cruise and his enemy charge at each other as in a joust on motorcycles and then leap off them to land on top of each other the unintentional guy on guy action oozes all over the screen. And when the movie ends with children carrying baloons i know that i have wasted precious timw with this garbage.unfortunatley metallica sells out and lends their music to this dud 
 The basics of this pad work. It captures a graphic of what you write, even through several layers of paper/pad (see recommendations). The pad is basically "almost" well-built and designed but has some annoying elements. 1. Yes, the paper size is not readily available in the US. The only 6x9 pad in most stores is a stenographer's notebook, which has spiral binding. To use it with the digimemo pad, you must rip the pages from the spiral and cut off the ragged top. After all my searching for 6x9 pads and fiddling with other pads and papers, I have ended up cutting my own sheets from 8.5x11 paper -- lots of wasted time. 2. The second paper-related annoyance: the provided clip, meant to hold a stack of single sheets, just doesn't. It is a whimpy little clip, close to worthless.  I had a huge issue with the compact flash card. My pad came claiming that I could insert any complact flash card up to and including 512MB capacity. Great? Not so much! I started with a 512. Didn't work. Tried other lesser capacities. NOPE! Contacted ACECAD tech support. They claimed that not all brands compact flash would work; they really only could say that a Sandisk brand would work. OK. Got a Sandisk 512 -- NOPE! Then tech support had me send them the serial number from the Sandisk 512. They claimed that it was not a genuine Sandisk, but a knockoff. I had purchased it from a reputable, nationwide seller. I contacted the seller. They were apologetic, said they would investigate, and sent me a replacement 512 CF, making sure it had the "authentic" serial number scheme, as ACECAD tech had claimed. Still didn't work! At this point I had wasted FAR too much time, and my anger and frustration had grown substantially. After trying other cards we had in house, I found a Canon brand 32MB compact flash (that came with a camera) that worked in the pad. I elected to cease my  worthless struggle with ACECAD tech for the time, and went about making better use of my time.  Third irritation regarding the product is the proprietary ACECAD DigiMemo Manager -- the software editor/viewer. No problem transfering the page files from the pad to PC hard drive via USB. And the SW is simple to use. But I think their marketing material misleads. Each page is a separate file. I have found no way to concatenate all those individual page files into a single file, which is the desireable thing to do. They talk about making an eBook, but all that does is convert the individual page file into another individual file (different extension) that increases its size considerably. You still cannot concatenate the pages. And I think the "eBook" format is still their own proprietary format. I haven't found anything else that can read/view those "eBook" files other than their ACECAD DigiMemo Manager. Not being able to gather several pages into one file was a huge disappointment. Yeah, I could convert them all into images (you have a few choices) and plop them into some other program, but this increases the foo-foo time, the fiddle-factor, and wastes my time! Instead of the pad making my life and what I need to do easier, as it appeared it might, it makes it more complex!  This pad COULD be a fine tool, if some of these small details were given some attention. I told ACECAD my suggestions, but I don't think they have responded 
 This book sucks, HARD. After a few chapters i burned it. Can you find a crapier title. There is only one good thing about this book is it burns nice and toasty 
 Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.  It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.  You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project.   Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed 
 We found the stories a joke. Lisa and I LOL ed at the  ha haaaa, see, twist in the 5 or 6 stories we read. I believe a person could buy any of the romance novels at the supermarket and get the same thing 
 I loved the previous books about Maybonne, Marlys, Freddie, Arna, and Arnold.  My children and I have reread them many times and we often quote the books ("a personal tragedy for me",  "the hills are alive", etc.).  But I did not recognize this Freddie.  He was not the same sensitive, bug-loving kid we met in the earlier stories, the one who was an "accident."  I think Lynda went a little over the top with shock value here.  I was extremely disappointed 
 This movie is superficial and populated with glamorous and unprincipled characters.  Kate Hudson, while photogenic in the extreme, is not believable with her fake and shaky Irish accent.  The plot is unbelievable, and the characters are offensive.  The structure of the film is clumsy, and the idea that any sort of trusting relationship and marriage is possible with these people who can not keep it in their shorts (including Hudson) is naive and unworldly, rather than the reverse.   The false sense of lighthearted sophistication is tedious.  Don't bother.   
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 Atlantic Records sure must be loose w/ their recording contracts. I don't see how this kind of drivel, regardless of the musicians' past records and reputations, could pass a demo test w/ stingy studio execs.  This CD was  simply self-indulgent and wasteful.  Froom is incapable of just playing  keyboards, w/out trying to overunderproduce a piece to the point of  absurdity.  Atmospheric just don't cut it if there's no compelling content  to hold it up.  And where's that killer guitar talent we know/knew in  Hidalgo?  Just a strange, disjointed, and goofy effort with no real payoff 
 This duo's previous books were packed with charts and ideas, but unfortunately Enchanted Knitting is a comparatively slim volume.  The charts are nice, but there are many less, and many are too large to use on a 60st electronic card -- so if you don't have 200st programming capability, you'll be a bit out of luck.  They reprise their "coat" pattern, with a few refinements, but otherwise, the patterns are not much to write home about.  All in all, buy it if you are looking to spend some money -- but if you skip it, don't feel too deprived 
 Usually I don't write reviews but with this book I had too.  I bought it bc my 10 month old won't eat baby food anymore and I was hopeing for some better ideas for what to feed him now.  All of the recepies for people under 12 months are either pures or contain egg.  Almost all of the ones for children over 12 months contain lots of milk and cheese some even contain nuts.  Also most of the recepies take a long time to prepair and cook.  In short their is not a single one I'm looking forward to trying and I'm glad I bought it used 
 At an age when he should have been interning in an NGO or assistant-managing a fast food outlet, Paternot became a tycoon on paper.  That was a topsy-turvy, demented era that evokes only embarrassment and disdain now.  Now Paternot, who was part of vaporizing trusting investors' money, tries yet again to make a few bucks off the corpse of that era.  Don't help him.  Borrow the book through interlibrary loan (it is unlikely your particular library will own it) and struggle through his amateurish prose for free 
 Unlike a good cup of tea, this book does not satisfy. Rather than being a history of tea and tea drinking it is more a vehicle for the McFarlanes to purge their guilt of being a family who greatly benefited by their former attachment to the tea growing industry. A discussion of the condition of the tea worker over time is valid enough but this work is ultimately an exercise at excessive hand- wringing. For those looking for a more comprehensive history of tea, especially commentary on the origins of various blends and regional tastes, one must look elsewhere. 
 I was more interested in the essence of the idea of going without most unnecessary material wants for a year. Too much fill in with political opinions and off track non related pulled out of nowhere information. Very obvious the author needed more material to constitute a book 
 This is a horrible movie with no redeeming value. I realize that such a knock will actually drive people to purchase this. Let me bring something to you attention.  This is a slasher movie with effective gore. In fact, for the time, the gore was more sick that similar movies. However, there are no scares, no suspense, no clever script, no story and it has a stupic ending. I know, that applies to most gore movies!  The problem with this movie is that it is overly mean spirited towards women (I am a man, a 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy that also raises a family).  The story, which has a guy killing women b/c of mistreatment from his mother, seems like it was written and directed by a person that shares the same demons as the killer of the film.    The murders in this movie are so mean-spirited (yet with no cinematic value) that a normal movie goer would have to be offended. This movie is not sick in a "good" movie way but rather sick in an ashamed manner.   This is a woman-bashing movie that should make any viewer feel guilty that they are patronizing this garbage. A movie should have an entertainment value. There is no cinematic, artistic touch on this film.  This is simply a mean, mean movie!    
 The concept that Israel needs a defence for it's existance or "a case for" at all is ridiculous and the title in itself is very revealing since it shows how insecure Dershowitz really is regarding Israel. It implies that a case needs to be made when none is needed! And the last thing Israel needs is to be defended by the someone like Dershowitz, who's long list of clients include- Jonathan Pollard, Mike Tyson, Leona Helmsley, O.J. Simpson, Harry Reems, Claus Van Bulow, Milken, Patty Hearst and Meir Kahane.   FACT: Israel is a nation founded in 1948 with defined borders which DID NOT INCLUDE the Gaza strip, the West Bank nor did it include Jerusalem. Israel acquired these territories after the 1967 War and Israel has no legal right to these occupied territories.  FACT: Due to the 1948 War some 700,000 Palestinian civilians were forced to leave their property and these refugees have never been allowed to return to their property. Refugees from war are entitled by international law to return to their land of origin.   FACT: LAND ACQUIRED BY WAR IS INADMISSIABLE ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW. All settlements built on these occupied lands are illegal according to international law. These settlements must be dismantled, vacated or returned.   FACT: Israel has never offered to return to pre existing 1967 borders in exchange for peace in any negotiations with the Palestinians.   The fact that Dershowitz needs to promote lies based on Joan Peter's academic fraud claiming that Palestine of the 19th century was a barren and unpopulated is an embarressment and shows how low Dershowitz will go. Dershowitz tactics in this book mirrors his thought process that he obviously uses in criminal court. But he fails to realize that his readership are not a mindless jury, hand picked and prevented from gaining information other than during court proceedings. Lots of distractions and side issues are offered here but little regarding the facts on the ground related above. Lucky for Dershowitz that he can lie and hide behind a book but had he been forced to actually make his case in a court of law he would lose since history speaks for itself. 
 The effect of reading the two short works in this book is one of overhearing two snobbish and conceited intellectuals arguing about painting and music in a wanna-be hip cafe. Being that, The Unknown Masterpiece is not only annoying, it's boring. Set in Paris in 1612, a young unproven painter named Nicolas Poussin has come to the city to make a name for himself by studying under the great master Frenhofer. Frenhofer has been holed up in his studio for years working on his great masterwork, a portrait of a woman who he has disturbingly started referring to as his wife. The problem is that he hasn't found a suitable model for him to be able to finish the work. "Gambara", the novella that is also in this book, also concerns an artist that can never quite find the X-factor that would allow him to finish his work. Signor Gambara is a composer of music, whose grand operas come out as random noise to all those that listen, except when he's drunk, then his music turns beautiful, as if he can only communicate his divine music when his conscious mind is gone. A young playboy Count is meanwhile trying to steal Gambara's beautiful wife Marianna.   This book was awful and is a poor example of Balzac's genius. Even for his big fans like me. I don't know why Richard Howard even went to the trouble of translating this. Supposedly "Masterpiece" has had a profound effect on painters like Picasso who identified with the character Frenhofer. So what? It's just the same blithering romantic notion of capturing the unattainable that we've heard for centuries. "Gambara" is even worse. In a normal Balzac work, he would have focused on the characters of the Count and the Gambaras, but here he focuses on chord names and arguments and analyses of operas that I had to literally slog through with my eyes. If these had been longer pieces I would not have finished the book. Steer clear. It's a shame because probably only about 10% of Balzac's novels are available in English so why waste time printing this sub-minor work?   If you want to see Balzac's true genius, check out any of the Penguin editions of his works. 
 This book is not what it purports to be.  It is a thorough catalog for commercially available phonics based reading education programs.  There is not actually any advice on "parenting".  There is plenty of advice on how to be adversarial with your child's teachers and school.  There is extensive use of the term "research-based", and this is what the authors use to support their arguments.  However, their scope is extremely limited.  The research they cite focuses on what works to teach kids to read words (decode the symbols) early in the school years, rather than what works to help kids truly read and comprehend complex language.  There is no discussion of reading comprehension.  I have no question that with their recommended approach, we could all have 6 year olds reading Dick and Jane.  They don't address the ultimate goal of reading,  understanding what one reads 
 I can't believe I was forced to buy this book from my school for an Oral Communications class. The book has almost no bearing on communication in an office or business setting. It's overrun with ethics, empathy, and bull about feedback. Even the glossary dosent give straight deffinitions. Instead of a deffinition it gives examples. I HATED THIS BOOK. I can say without exageration that I will use this book for kindling in my fireplace 
 2 maybe 3 good songs.  The rest is TRASH (i.e. noise).  I don't know how she's managed to stay on radio for this long, because like Vanilla Ice she should have only last one year & then disappeared.   
 What company would make a router that you can set up wired and then take it wireless and it won't work. Incredible. My experience mirrored exactly that of many who have already written. It just shouldn't be this way.  When I finally did get it working, after tweaking some settings, and spending all freaking day on the Linksys forum it had virtually no signal in a very modest house.  I do have to say the their forum is top rate. The people were very helpful and very friendly and a great place to turn if you don't want to go through scripted support suppliers.  Product wise a very disappointing experience. People wise very good but long gone are the days that you put up with an inferior product because the people are so good 
 Playboy asks why this movie hasn't become a cult classic.  I'll tell you.    First of all, the painting on the cover does not look like the actual woman in the film.  One or two of the reviewers liked the way she looks.  Okay, to each his own, but don't be surprised if you find her unattractive.    Second, the nudity.  No, she is NOT nude all the time.  Nor half the time.  Nor a fourth of the time.  Nor...  She's nude a few seconds now and then.  No more than any other movie.    Third, the movie is only 79 minutes, and the first four of them are skippable.    The movie is mostly a man fighting with a Neanderthal survivor.  Both behave more childishly than primitively.  You'll see more convincing behavior in Clan of the Cave Bear.    There are NO explicit sex scenes.  Also, no effective sex scenes of any kind.  Even the fight scenes are disappointing.    Oh, and did I mention that the dialogue is a joke?    Bottom line: for almost every viewer, this movie will not be worth watching even once.   
 Standard Heinlein Disclaimer: Heinlein is a frequently-polarizing figure in American literature. The people who dislike his work (e.g., A. Panshin) seem to *really* dislike his work, and often for reasons that seem to me spurious. The people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of Heinlein's problems as a writer. I like Heinlein's work quite a bit, and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable, but I would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the "best of the SF genre." They are for me, however, always enjoyable, and that is no small thing to find in an author.   And as you may have guessed, this is one of the two.  (The other is "Rocketship Galileo" which, in my opinion, only suffers from the mistakes of a person new to writing novels, and a hoary "Nazis on the Moon!" plotline that, to put it mildly, has not worn well with time.)  The story behind this book is, apparently, that Heinlein was ill as he was finishing it, and it was published without the traditional editing cycle that he usually employed.  Could be.  Frankly, it's hard for me to imagine editing making this novel more readable.  This is a relatively interesting idea (a man's brain transplanted into a woman's body), but as many others have pointed out, the execution is poor.  Frankly, there's not much story here at all, aside from a man exploring what it's like being in a woman's body.  But the exploration is by turns dull and absurd.  Man in woman's body has many sexual flings!  Man in woman's body poses nude for a painter!  Man in woman's body cooks dinner for widower husband!  Man in woman's body finds that piano lessons he took as a boy are now useless, but he can run secretarial equipment!  The thrills never stop.  There are any number of other irritating things about this book (personally, I find being forced to try to pronounce "Joan" as "Joanne" really irritating, but that's probably just me [If you want it pronounced "Joanne", spell it that way, Bob!]), but I'll let you read the other reviews.  The summation is, for this lover of Heinlein, who has read almost everything he wrote, I can't reread this novel.  And for me, folks, that's really saying something 
 I'm surprised that no-one has commented on the overly complicated knitting/purling method used in this book.    The book shows only one way to make a knit/purl stitch, and it's slow and torturous.  You insert the right needle into the stitch as you normally would when knitting or purling, but then you hold the point where the needles intersect, pick up the working yarn with your free hand and wind it around the needle.  Then you pick up both needles again and complete the stitch as usual.  This method would frustrate any child, enough to get them to stop knitting altogether 
 Just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than I wanted. Never used. Returned it 
 I was about to order it online w/out even looking through it thinking that Sofia Coppola could do no wrong.  Well apparently she can because this book was highly disappointing.   Like the reviews below me have stated, it is simply the script and some low-quality photos on plain paper.   so glad I didn't purchase it 
 OK, people, here's some advice before you think about buying this book. Don't just look at all the 4 and 5 star customer reviews - rank the customer review list from Lowest Rank First and read all the 1 star reviews as well. That way you can REALLY get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into. Sure, in both the high reviews and the low reviews there's just basic no-brainer reviews - "it's great!!" or "its sucks!!" But amongst all the one star reviews I discovered some smart punters whom i SHOULD have read before buying the damn book myself. Yup, i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews I realise that some reviewers had duly warned me. This book is TERRIBLE. It gives only the scantiest of basics on body language, stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write. And the photos - MY GOD! Its Mr Steele with his wife and their friends, posing away in their garish shirts and shorts...these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for "flirting" and "body language" I've ever ever seen. And in his blurb photo at the front of the book he's standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest - there's something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that I find highly disturbing. Yucko. As others have said, if i could give this book a zero star rating, I would. Avoid, everyone, avoid like the plague. 
 Thora Birch (American Beauty, Ghost World) stars as Liz a girl who has escaped after going missing for a short period of time. The detective played by Embeth Davidtz (13 Ghosts, Army of Darkness) is on her case as she tries to fit the pieces and figure out what happened to Liz. Liz and 4 other get together and wind up being stuck in the woods. When of them stays out of The Hole they all eventually try to get out of there in one piece. There are 2 versions of the story told by two people and in each of them and in each it tells about what happened to the group of people. Thora Birch's performance along with a solid supporting cast including Desmond Harrington (Love Object, Wrong Turn) and Keira Knightley (Domino, King Arthur) with some good moments anchor this movie. I saw the ending coming. Also starring Laurence Fox (The Last Drop, Gosford Park) and Daniel Bracklebank (The Hours, Merlin). 
 The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character.  It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene.  The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars.  The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story.  Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to "tighty-whities."  They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one 
 I already explained why I didn't like the book. True crime books are supposed to have a detailed description of the crime, all the clues, leads, and tips that lead up to the arrest of the suspect(s). 23 Days of Terror was more of an homage to the victims than anything; and in all honesty, I find that boring. If you want to see what a good true crime book should be like, read The Brown's Chicken Massacre by Maurice Posley. Every detail as to how the police caught the two murderers is written, and Posley still manages to show the respect for the victims, but it's not boring like this one was. As to your distaste for my closing line: excuse me if you can't take a joke. You act as if you live in the only city that has ever had a serial killer. Just because your city's tragedy happened to be on CNN doesn't make you Yoda 
 The story is incomplete and confusing. There are considerable gaps without a parent, adult or smart kid adding additional explanations as the story goes along. If you haven't seen the film you would find yourself scratching your head. Shame on Pixar and Disney for allowing such a poorly written book to be published. If your kid doesn't read, the pictures, frames right out of the cartoon, are great. (The two stars are for the pictures.) But, where were the editors? Is the assumption that kids don't read anyway, so who's going to notice? Well anyway, here's to the illiterates: the one's who call themselves editors and the one's they are cultivating 
 I just stopped, bored. Maybe there is something here to grab someone,  but not this total fan of Unsworth's other work. I say, read the book he was trying to write when I wrote this one. Sacred Hunger towers over this like  Churchill over John Majo 
 There were a few interesting nuggets of information in this book, but there were miles of reading between them.  The first part of the book is an exercize of retelling you how great this book is going to be and how it will change your business life.  The rest of the book is a smattering of pedestrian marketing information repackaged to sound like astonishing breakthroughs in thinking.  Yes, I understand the components of selling three ways.  Yes, I get it.  What a waste of time and money 
 As a die-hard Cathy fan, just bought this book without looking at it..expected more cartoons, a larger book.  The recipes seem to be those you can find in any cookbook - mashed potatoes?? hot fudge sauce??  Very disappointed.  If there was more about Cathy in the book it might be worth it..but this was waste of money 
 ...upon actual research it is clearly false. Many others have delved into the finer points of Menzies' poor methodology and often deliberate exaggeration or falsities, so I won't bother. I'll only list four points that I think stand out even without deep fact checking:  1)Niccolo di Conti, the venetian explorer and crucial link in the book who supposedly sailed with the Chinese treasure fleet in 1421, failed to mention in his memoirs anything about Chinese junks or going to the four corners of the world. This seems strange.  2)The Fleet sailed to virtually every coastline in the world but missed Europe entirely, the one place sure to mark their passing for posterity. This is neither evidence nor disproof, merely a sketchy coincidence.  3)Native Americans are given startlingly short shrift, both in the book and in many of the reviews. Virtually every time something sophisticated is presented in the ancient new world it is attributed to the Chinese, reminding me of the Easter Island "mystery" of who carved those giant heads. For the record, Native populations weren't childish savages; prior to European contact they had very sophisticated civilizations, fully capable of jewelery work, cloth garments, and carving statues.  4)Lastly, Given the vast numbers of Chinese sailors involved(roughly 25-30,000), the presence of domesticated animals such as horses and pigs, and the inevitable presence of huge numbers of stow-away rats, doesn't it strike anyone as odd that there were apparently no diseases passed on to the various native populations in the Americas? It only took a very small amount of European contact to spark the largest, and deadliest pandemic in history that raged for nearly two centuries killing unknown millions of Native Americans. Chinese contact of the scale claimed would certainly have had a similar, if not worse, effect.  Ultimately Menzies' book is entertaining, leaving the reader hoping it is true merely for the fantastic nature of the thesis. In the end, however, the evidence and analysis simply are not there.  
 First let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract.   My conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics.   As others have said in this review forum. This book can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. I fail to see the "wit" in his endless negitivity and bashing.   This book has a few funny parts, but I cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. It is so unbelievible in places, that you know you are on an imagined tangent.   Dont waste your money or time. I am so happy I bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale! 
 This is a "self help" book for managers and other senior level people that are job hunting.  The author is a recruiter of the "headhunter" variety - she gets quality people for companies for a fee.  This book (subtitled "12 secrets to getting on the headhunter's radar screen") contains advice on how to act and what to write about yourself to better your chances of getting picked up by a headhunter.  The title is great!  It sold me the book, but then the book did not meet my expectations.  There is an excellent chapter on the interview, and a fair amount of very scattered miscellaneous advice that you must dissect from filler, padding, and repetition.  The disappointing things about the book were the remarkable lack of advice on getting selected by a recruiter, and the frequently repeated notion that only through a retained recruiter can you succeed.  The author, of course, has her bias.  The "12 secrets" are not really secret.  Most of the book is pretty mundane "resume/cover letter/interview" advice of the type that can be found in most "job hunting" books 
 There are some good pointers that will be familiar to those who have studied strategy, but the authors' attempt to dress up existing knowledge using the "hardball" metaphor is just a gimmick.    The authors laud "hardball players" such as Dell, WalMart, and Toyota.  These are the companies that pursue competitive advantage "with a single-minded focus."  As if on cue, the "softball players" are trotted out -- those companies that "aren't intensely serious about winning."  Wouldn't it be nice if it were this simple?  The truth is that many businesses play hardball but lose anyway.  Think about it.  The "hardball" sports analogy implies that the goal is to defeat one's competitors and, by doing so, win the game.  As somebody who has built a successful business, experience tells me that this is not accurate.  Truly innovative businesses learn how to change the game, or play their own game, and thereby deliver superior value and results.  Defeating your competitor might be a by-product of success, but it is not the main objective.  After all, Toyota didn't have to defeat BMW to become the powerhouse of the auto industry.  This book is too simplistic to be useful to anybody who already has a rudimentary grasp of corporate strategy 
 This book is superficial, biased (full of unsubstantiated generalizations about people), and not very well researched. As a journalism grad, I was disappointed that I bought this and kinda embarrassed for the author, who comes off as superficial, naive, and very provincial. The silly and erroneous generalizations about city vs. country could only come from someone provincial who's never been around. Funny how many NY people fall into that category 
 I'm completely baffled by the five-star reviews for this book. The main characters are likable enough, certainly, but nothing. ever. happens. There is no narrative tension and no real plot, no conflict, no obstacles for the characters to overcome, nothing of substance--just a vaguely pleasant meandering toward an indefinite conclusion. Even the much-anticipated baby seems to disappear into the background once she arrives, like a sitcom baby whose birth is a great episode for sweeps week but who is conveniently asleep off-camera  for every episode thereafter.   Perhaps my opinion was tainted by reading this book too soon after Alison McGhee's "Shadow Baby" -- a book with both style AND substance. Colwin suffered in the comparison. However lovely her sentences and paragraphs may be, in this case they don't add up to anything greater than the sum of their parts 
 This book offers a comprehensive information package that guides the reader through  pertinent facts that make it clear yet simple to  understand the principles of metal forming and working.The book is packed  with formulas that simplify complicated tooling problems that occur when  melal is formed. This book was written by a  group of acomplished highly  respected Tool & Die Journeymen who pooled their years of experiance of  the trade togeather into one compact, resource, handbook 
 I recently bought season 3 of "Greatest American Hero."  WHAT'S UP THOUGH WITH THE EPISODES BEING OUT OF ORDER?  Ralph and Pam are married in about 3 to 4 episodes (disc 1 & 2) before we actually see the wedding on disc 3.  It was disappointing when I started watching the episodes and realized this.  I decided to copy the episode guide so I could view the episodes in the right order.  The first two seasons released were in the right order; possibly Anchor Bay manufactured season 3 wrong 
 Loved the price but I never actually received the item.  It shipped to the wrong address and I never got it back :- 
 On the shelf or on line, this trucks shovel appears to lock into position above the rig but it doesnt. It took me nearly 10 minutes to remove strapping anchored to this truck within the packaging. My son spent a minute playing with this truck only to move on to his other toys. Yeah, the shovel portion drags on the floor and will NOT lock into position above the rig. This truck can hardly be moved through the carpet much less in sand. I grew up with Tonka trucks and this was obviously designed by some young suit that was babysat by the television and playstation. If your looking for a durable fun truck for your child, move on as this truck wont get the smile your looking for.   
 I'm sorry, but this album is simply not good. Anyone who thinks it is is just blinded by the trendiness of Stephen Merritt and his clicky crew. I can't think of one song that is even remotely close to the greatness of most of the songs on the last 6ths album. These are uninspired songs written by a bored musician. Remember those catchy pop songs on Wasps' Nest? or Holiday? well, kiss those goodbye cuz there are none here. What you get now are 14 heartless, boring, and thoughtless tracks. I recommend you skip this one 
 This is a very uneven compilation of unreleased and rare home recordings, practice-space jams, comp tracks, and outtakes from 1982-1994.  Unfortunately after listening to this you'll know why most of this wasn't released before.  Its more of a collection of (mostly instrumental) sketches and half baked ideas than an actual album.  Of course their are some good songs such as "I Love You Peggy", or the 13th Floor Elevators cover "Earthquake", or "Endhoven Chicken Masque" but Humpty Dumpty LSD also contains a lot of absolute garbage such as "Night of the Day", a number played on acoustic guitar accompanied by unintelligible low pitched and unintelligible high pitched voices.  It's as boring a song as you can imagine.  Or the worst number "Perry Intro" which may or may not be the beginning to the song Perry that has been slowed way way down to a sludge like crawl.  I mean come on, this is the kinda crap that every kid with a tape player or digital delay has done since tape machines (or delays) were invented.  Big time yawn for that one.  Most of this album just isn't that interesting or groundbreaking, the quality of the "songs" isn't high.  In fact it's pretty low because this stuff wasn't intended for release.  Its like a Buttholes sketch book, not a finished work.  If that sounds interesting to you or if you are a die hard fan you may want to pick this up, otherwise avoid it or rip it from a friend 
 I remember when I reached the end of Ilium, I thought to myself, "cool, I guess Olympos will be about the war of the gods vs. the Greeks and Trojans."  I mean, what else could the sequel be about really?  Achilles' mission to dethrone the gods, Zeus specifically, was definitely the focal point of the last 50 or so pages of Ilium, so obviously Olympos would focus on and resolve that.  Well, I guess obviously not.  Olympos turns out to be a rambling, incomprehensible mess of a story.  It turns out that that war between humans and gods is only the focus for about the first 100 pages, and then Simmons turns the focus of the novel into an abstract retelling of The Tempest, with characters that either we barely encountered in Ilium, or we didn't even meet at all.  Overall, the story in Olympos is just too fragmented to really make the reader care about what is going on.  As we try to keep track of roughly 7 different storylines, everything just starts to run together, and we slowly begin to stop caring about what is occurring.    I didn't completely hate the novel, though.  Much like Ilium, it has many strong moments, but Dan Simmons never builds on those strong moments to make the entire story stronger.  It seems like Simmons believe that if he thrown in a great segment every once in a while, the reader will forgive him for the rambling, incoherent mess that happens between those moments.  We are ultimately asked to care about characters for reasons that we have no reason to give a hoot.  With Ada and Harman, we are supposed to believe and care about their strong relationship with each other, but since they spend the entire book apart, their connection seems flimsy, at best.    By far the most frustrating part, though, is the anticlimactic finale that will leave you scratching your head.  You've just sat through roughly 1300 pages of story, and there is no climax.  None.  The book builds throughout all of its 700 pages to what you would think will be an amazing, jaw-dropping climax, but it's almost like Simmons is enjoying being withholding.  Instead of an exciting ending, we get a chance encounter/connection between two of the main storylines, and then we skip ahead to years after the conclusion of the events, and we are told in an objective, boring manner of what happened at the end.  Total disappointment 
 This was not what one would expect from the title.  There were no methodologies provided to research and detect fraud and very little in terms of accounting controls was addressed.  The book is a collection of  anecdotes and cases with very little practical information that transcends  the most basic concepts.  The book spends too much time discussing  behavioral aspects of fraud  as opposed to legitimate financial  investigation.  Overall, a huge disappointment 
 I read the reviews and read the summary and was very excited to read a graphic informative book on profiling. This book was awful. There was no detail or even a small piece of info. about any of his cases. I agree with previous reviews, he is too cocky. I can't imagine how many cases he has gotten wrong! I was exhausted by chapter two listening to this guys sad life. This is NOT a true crime book. It's a biography of someone feeling sorry for themself. I still have no idea how his cases were solved because he never said... 
 I had expected something of the genre and quality of Market Wizards I & II,  Trading for a living, Trade like a Hedge Fund (by James Altucher), Soros on Soros, Reminiscences of a stock operator, Running Money by Andy Kessler  etc etc. I had been confoundedly disappointed. The book is flooded of interviews with hedge fund managers anonymous leading you to nowhere but setting goals, visualizing success, overcoming fears and all the stuff you find in any trading psychology book, only that the writing skill of the author is sub-standard. The author had repeated the term "Hedge Fund" highly frequently. However, the content is not related particularly to any hedge fund or hedge fund manager at all. Also, the author had elaborated the term "mastery" throughout the book. I assure you that you will have no idea of how to achieve it unless you employ the author as your personal trading counsellor.   In short, a waste of time, money and the paper to print the book. 
 I can't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review. We have 10m twins, and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months. It's terrible.  PROBLEMS:   1. NO SUN PROTECTION. the visors are locked in place. Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back, it will be beating in your babies' eyes, and you'll need to buy a non-Peg Perego sunshade accessory. 2. HARD TO STEER. It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt. If the sidewalk buckles just an inch (common from tree roots), the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks. It's hard to steer in a straight line, so it's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks.  3. IT'S FLIMSY. The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use. It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it. The cupholder broke during the first week. 4. HARD TO UNFOLD. It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position. Don't even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands: you need both hands free to deal with this thing. 5. BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The stroller comes with no weight/height/age  suggestions. When we first tried to put our twins in it, they were swimming in it, and couldn't be upright. When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely, the support rep said " don't know."   Yes it's lightweight and folds up nicely. But the light weight is actually a drawback; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that's difficult to steer.   My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers. Even if you aren't an active parent -- I'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand, dirt, and grass that you will encounter.  If stroller size is the most important factor to you, look at "stadium seating" strollers. 
 Jack kerouac's sexuality...ummm...a subject for a book on his life. I read it through. There isn't anything new here if you read or listen to any of the Beat novels, poems and journals. It's interesting that in Kerouac's "Vanity Of Duluoz" the dedication page states "Extra special thanks to Ellis Amburn for his emphatic brilliance and expertise". It's pretty evident what drove Jack to write. It's all in his books. "Dr Sax" comes to mind. One good place to look for the real Jack Kerouac is not with this waste of time book but at a clip of him reading on the Steve Allen Show...look at his face when he finishes...closely. It said more about him than a thousand pages of bio's and bad press 
 If looked as a parady of some other books it was some what  amusing. But very heavy handed 
 My parents gave this book to me when I was a kid because I was a "late bloomer".  I really think that was the beginning of my self esteem issues.  I was unaware that I was a "late bloomer" until they pointed it out to me by giving me the book.  I can remember being so sad reading it and thinking there was something wrong with me.  Now that my daughter is a bit of a late bloomer, it's gotten me thinking about this book.  Please don't buy it for your kid.  If you do, please explain to them why you're giving it to them.  Don't leave it to them to draw their own conclusions that they are like Leo they can't do anything right 
 A uniformly bland book.  The author says in 11 chapters what could easily be said in a couple of paragraphs.  And then, in the final chapter, he completely loses it and embarks on some sort of ridiculous diatribe against AI research.  He displays an amazing degree of animosity towards those involved in this field of research, some of which he names personally.  There are many far better books on usability available from Amazon.com, forget this one.  What can I say, Leonardo would dismiss him as a fool 
 Once again, someone just did not care enough to showcase Ms. Mitchell's work in the manner deserved.  Aside from the gorgeous cover photo by Herb Ritts (which was also published a few years ago in "Rolling Stone" magazine anyway), you might as well just pull out your old albums and read the lyrics printed on the covers (not to mention the beautiful photos and paintings included on all Ms. Mitchell's albums).  Maybe someday someone will take the time, effort, and expense to "do the right thing" in terms of Ms. Mitchell's work.  Unfortunately, they basically did the "wrong thing" this time around 
 If you are a closed-minded member of Christendom's juggernaut, this book is for you! If you want unbiased truth about smaller groups, you'll have better results from other publications 
 I was completely disappointed in the size of this book. The city guide of Possum Trot, Kentucky has to be bigger then this. Measuring in at a hefty 3&1/2" tall, its no Abe Lincoln. It was more like something you find in a CrackerJack box 
 There are probably 3 ways they could have gone about making this compilation on Glen a good one:  1) The greatest chart hits overall..giving better stature to the ones that charted not only on country but also pop and/or easy listening Billboard charts. 2) Focus on the biggest songs on the country Billboard charts..meaning if a song charted #1 country with a poor pop showing you give it preference over one that charted #30 country but #20 pop 3) Try to assemble the "artistically" best tunes from Campbell's career  Approach #3 is out the door the minute you use the word "Hits". Hits are an OBJECTIVE thing...it either was or was not a chart hit. If you're gonna name it "Greatest Hits" then artistry can't be your TOP criterion for selection.  Approach #1 is out because one of his top 10 country tunes from 1976 , a medley of "Don't Pull Your Love/Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye" which also crossed to the pop chart, isn't here at all. I also don't see "I Knew Jesus (Before He was a Superstar)" which was a decent sized country AND middling pop hit. Strike 2...  That leaves Approach #2...a "country hits" collection. Does it succeed? #1 hit "I Wanna Live" (1968)...not here. Top 10 hits "Try a Little Kindness","Manhattan,Kansas","Honey Come Back","Everything a Man Could Ever Need","It's only Make Believe", his top 10 duets with Bobby Gentry on "Let it Be Me" and "All I Have to Do is Dream"..not here. The aforementioned "Don't Pull your Love/Then you Can Tell me Goodbye" and "Country Boy (You Got your Feet in L.A.)"..more Top 10 hits missing in action. [I'll cut them a break on post-1981 material after Glen left Capitol..but that would be ANOTHER 5 missing Top 10s otherwise].  Wait, you say...it's only 1 disc. They have to make decisions as to which huge hits to include. OK...60 minute runtime...axe "Classical Gas","Amazing Grace","King of the Road (instrumental)","Mr. Tambourine Man (Instrumental)"...none of which were chart hits..and that frees up space for at least 4 more hits. Then add about 15 more minutes of music (80 minutes is CD capacity) and you could squeeze in about 9 of those missing hit songs..(that's all but 1 of the ones I mentioned if you're keeping score)  BOTTOM LINE: A complete failure to represent Glen's hits. Look instead for ALL THE BEST (ASIN B00006JIC0)(which collects just about all the ones I mentioned as missing and retains the big stuff that's on this one).[One caveat: Some have mentioned poor remastering on that one so sample it via library or a friend if you can first].  If you have a bigger stack of money available, get double CD set GLEN CAMPBELL COLLECTION 1962-1989 instead (ASIN B000002ZDA on Razor and Tie Records) for the biggest stuff plus rarities like his first big chart hit (1962's #20 hit "Kentucky Means Paradise" recorded with the Green River Boys) and a lot of his late 80s top 10 country hits. 
 This movies rates right up there with "Schindler's List" . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda.  Fortunately, Ted Turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making "Gettysburg," and the even better "Gods and Generals."  If you want to see a real, accurate depiction of the War For Southern Independence (aka, The Civil War), watch "Gods and Generals" or "Gone With The Wind," and stay away from movie garbage like "Andersonville."    Also watch for the extended version DVD of "Gods and Generals" coming for the Christmas season of 2005. 
 I was disappointed in the latest Lincoln Rhyme mystery. The book had more twists than a Chubby Checker song and in the end they strained credibility.  Rhyme and Sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the Watchmaker. Rhyme has met his match with the Watchmaker, a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for Rhyme to follow.  Running parallel to the story of the Watchmaker, Sachs is also lead detective on her first case - a case that appears to involve police corruption. Sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt. Ron Pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to Rhyme and Sachs to solve the case.   The book introduces Kathryn Dance, a visiting Californian expert in Kinesics, the study of body language. Dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case. There is also a hint of romance with officer Sellitto which is ultimately left hanging. The information about Kinesics is interesting and Dance is a character that could have used more development.   The title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar, which is also a time of death. The book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the Watchmaker. There was some fascinating information, but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks.  The book lurches from one plot twist to the next. At first it was exciting, but after a while it became tedious. NOTHING was what it seemed. Further I found Rhyme less likeable in this book - grumpy, bossy, pedantic and sarcastic. The only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose Sachs.  At times I found the writing clumsy. Deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters, such as,        "the handsome, sardonic and impatient criminalist" I found it trite to describe Rhyme that way.   This book is not as good as earlier Rhyme mysteries.  
 I bought this radio as a Christmas gift for my seven year old son.  The CD player did not work. It was a bummer.  Also, when I bought it I did not know that is was a refurbished unit 
 While this book is okay, you can get much better historical novels.  Try Allen W Eckert books.  He has written several that cover this same approximate era and places. This book is just not worth the money 
 The characters are all over the top dysfunctional.  The main character is boring and self destructive.  When the characters are not likeable who cares what has or will happen to them??  This book reads like a 1970's Movie of the Week starring Lindsay Wagner.  
 There's weird but listenable (see: Bjork).  Then there is acquired taste (see: Stina Nordenstam).  And then there is quirky but endearing (see: Joanna Newsom).  And after all that we hit Coco Rosie who are weird, quirky and an acquired taste but, if we are being brutally honest, there is not enough of the listenable and endearing about their music to make you tolerate the oddities.  For some this will be a delight and they will rave about the album till the cows come home.  But most should be warned, this is eclectic in the extreme and simply does not have enough good tunes to make it a worthwhile listen.  A shame, really 
 It makes for a wonderful book when your toddler is going through one of those stages of just wanting to read the same book over and over and over and over and over b/c there isn't much for you to read.   I have to admit though that although I find the illustrations charming the whole premise is kind of creepy. I always end the reading with, "And then CPS came and took the mother away and placed baby with a loving, responsible family and Carl went on to star in his own TV show." I don't want my daughter being left with the impression that if we get a dog at some point it will be babysitting. I'm all for catharsis in children's books to show irresponsible behavior, etc. I think this one is disturbing b/c the parent is the one that's so horrible. The kid and dog are doing what one would expect 
 This movie is not worth Sam Elliot.  I was very dissapointed, I will most likely thow it away 
 A friend of mine works for an petrochemical exploration company.  They specialize in determining potential locations of oil deposits by drilling cores into layers of sedimentary deposits and looking at the evolutionary sequences of micro-fossils which were accumulated millions of years ago on ancient sea-floors. Oil (and coal) deposits formed when decaying plant matter became buried under sediments and underwent subsequent chemical alteration.  The plant material requires millions of years to be converted into oil or coal. (They're called fossil fuel for a reason, you know.)  When you analyze a drill core sample, and if you find particular micro-fossils of species that only lived during a certain geological age that corresponds to the age when oil deposits formed, then you might be in an area where oil can be found.  Her company gets contacts from huge oil companies to help them make multi-billion dollar decisions on where to drill for oil based partly on the information obtained by looking at micro-fossils.  Oil companies have been doing this for decades. Don't believe me.  Find out for yourself.  Search the internet for websites about oil exploration micropaleontology.  Next time you fill your tank, consider the role evolution played in both the creation and the discovery of the gas you're pumping into your car.  I own stock in the company my friend works for and have made some nice returns on it.  I also have a relative who works for a medical research institute that uses DNA analysis to find out how viruses and genetic defects cause disease.  He's working on therapies for several types of cancer.  They use genetic mutations and evolutionary histories of diseases to understand how cells, viruses and diseases operate.  They've already had success with some drugs and I've made money off of a drug company's stock as a result.  The science is way over my head.  However, based on the logic of this book, you have to conclude that genetic mutations can't be studied with any certainty because it seems they can occur only if and when God wants them to.  I don't know how I'll be able to break it to him but I guess someone will have to tell him that his research is simply a waste of time.  I know that seems at odds with the fact I've made money off the stock market . . . but Phillip Johnson wants me to have an open mind after all, and, let's face it, he's so much smarter than these people.  I can't imagine how insulting it must be to intelligent, dedicated, highly educated, hard working, honest, professional people like these, who use the principles of evolution in their day to day work, in billion dollar industries, for them to hear people say that evolution didn't happen or that it is just an ideology. (I should sell the stock in these companies soon, before they crash when word gets out that evolution is a myth.)  Folks, there is a tremendous amount of information supporting evolution. In all honesty, it is downright silly to contend at this point that living things have not evolved over the eons.  It is simply a fact of life.  It is not a religious belief or an opinion.  I urge you to truly inform yourselves about evolution from sources other than creationists or  IDers or whatever they call themselves.  Look at the depth and detail of information supporting evolution.  There are many websites about it. Check them out.  Look at some professional research journals on subjects related to biology, geology, palenotology, etc.  Ask yourself, "Can this tremendous amount of detailed information accumulated by researchers for hundreds of years really be fake or incorrect?"  "Are all the thousands of highly intelligent, highly educated people around the world who are currently conducting research on evolution, as well as those using it in their daily work, all wrong?"  "Would scientists at the most prestigious universities in the world really deliberately lie about this?"  "Why would they risk being caught in a lie and ruin their professional careers?"  Please, be realistic about science.  And, by the way, you can be Christian and fully accept evolution.  I do.  So do the friend and relative I mentioned above.  Of course, I guess we're just closed-minded. 
 Much like her other book, "Wild Swans", this is another piece of Imperialist-apology and anti-Communism that would make Joe McCarthy proud.  It reads like cheap fiction, and in the end, has little historical value.   Read "Red Star Over China", "Fanshen", and "From Ike to Mao" instead. 
 When I was a university student 14 years ago, I followed this book to the letter - 3 days in the gym every week for six months and then a split system which got me in the gym 4 days a week for another year or so.   In hindsight, it worked (as any beginner gets a little bigger anyway just by heading to the gym) but I picked up a copy of BRAWN a year later - training twice a week just focussing on the big exercises and realised far better results.    This book is good for motivation, a trip down memory lane for some; it has some good ideas but generally the routines aren't suitable for anyone training without steroids.  I wonder why Joe Weider never discussed the issue when obviously so many, if not all contributors, depended on steriods to realize their success...  
 Although there are many varieties of paella with regional ingredients there is one indispensable ingredient; short grain Spanish rice. The best part of paella is without any question the "socarrat" which is the toasty caramelized layer of rice which sticks to the bottom of the paella pan when the dish is properly prepared on top of the stove or better yet, the grill. One can not make proper paella in an oven, convection or otherwise. The rice will be a soupy mess or dried out but never yield the desireable crunchy "socarrat".  "Paella Paella" is a far superior book although a great recipe for learning the technique of paella preparation can be found at the Fine Cooking magazine website. After you make that once then you may use whatever ingredients you wish to combine to make fantastic paella. Be creative.   Is it worth the trouble to find the proper pan, Spanish rice, saffron and olive oil? Absolutely! "Socarrat" Rules 
 I simply thought that "The Fall of the House of Usher" was rather boring and I found myself dozing off.  I thought that "The Pit and the Pendulum" was a much better flick and a much more interesting adaptation.  In fact, I was quite disappointed with this adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant short story "Fall of the House of Usher".  While the movie provides a grim atmosphere in accordance with the Poe's story, the movie drags and never really picks up enough steam to keep one's interest...however, I found the actual story written by Poe to be quite interesting and very entertaining...perhaps that is my problem with the movie as it is not nearly as good as the story itself.  This movie "The Fall of the House of Usher" could have been much better.  Notwithstanding the poor adaptation of Poe's classic story of despair, Vincent Price, as always, was terrific in his role...still, this is not enough to make this a good adaptation.  I recommend watching the clearly superior "The Pit and the Pendulum" instead of this flick 
 I only read through the first third of the book before I had to give up on it.  Often the authors overgeneralize - they take a statement made to them by one person of color and then say that all people of color feel the same way.  That's not only counterproductive, it borders on perpetuating racism.  They have a very negative mindset that I find to be discouraging.  My husband and I are considering transracial adoption of an older child; if I continue to read this book, I am certain they would talk me out of it.  Plus, I find this book to be very poorly written.  It lacks any coherent organization.  This book is in desperate need of an editor.  Even if you agree with their approach to the issues, the typos, poor grammar and lack of structure will certainly make it difficult to follow their thought process.  Unless James Joyce's stream of consciousness writing style is appealing to you, you will not enjoy the way the authors jump topics every other paragraph.  There are much better books dealing with these issues available.  The only redeeming quality of this book is the quotes from children and adults who were raised in multiracial families 
 I live in El Centro, the winter training grounds of the Blue Angels. I have watched them train from January through March for a good many years. People who buy this DVD are probably expecting to see 45 minutes of air show. Instead, you hear a mumbling narrative by John Travolta which is very much a history of naval aviation, and too little flying. The lead pilot, or "Boss" is assigned by the Pentagon, and this video does not point out that the "Boss" of this team was removed because of safety violations. The other pilots didn't want to fly with him. The best Blue Angels video I have seen is "Blue Angels: Xtreme Close-Up" which aired on the Military Channel. It is pure flying. If you want lots of air show mixed with interesting behind the scenes then I recommend "Blue Angels: A Year In The Life". Just don't buy this one unless you want to fall asleep.   
 The bible was less preachy than the 252 pages of garbage this book manages to slap in your face.  The random self-important personal injections from the author only take away from any paper-thin foundation of fact that she tries to place on the subject.  I have seen more political impact from a Jerry Springer show than from the lackluster personal accounts contained inside this book.  Horrible! A complete nightmare to read. 
 I bought this unit on Ebay. So I don't really know how old the machine is. But only in couple of months I got this dreaded H02 error. From other posts it seems the usual way for this item to go. Would not buy another Panasonic DVD Player 
 There are "catholics" and CATHOLICS.These young ladies are in the first category, unfortunately. You cannot talk like that and say: "I am Catholic" because that's not true and the title of the book is really irresponsable. If you don't like being Catholic, or you don't want to, or you want to do with your body whatever you want to, that's fine, go ahead,  it's up to you, BUT please, dont make fun of being Catholic or don't ridiculize the teachings of the Church because out there are some people that really believes and lives these teachings. And there's something called RESPECT.  The Word of Jesus is life and whoever believes in this Word and also lives according to this Word, is going to live the real plenitude of life. This include all aspects in his/her life including sexuality. If you want to have a better understand of human sexuality and live it fully, I recommend you "Theology of the body for beginners" by Christopher West. This book has changed for better the lives of many, many people. You can get it here in Amazon for less than 10 bucks. Try it ! It's worth it!! 
 This book is ok.  It's very slow to get started, and the book spends more time with bizarre incidents then getting to the point as to why or how this resort become haunted.  I only have 50 pages left and I still don't know why this resort is haunted.  I wouldn't recommend it 
 Unless you have a new softball glove to break in, this product is not for you. Way, way too much oil.  Just nappy. I might as well have put mayo in my hair. 
 I thought it would be fun to see some interesting insights into why I collect books and like collecting in general. Nope. His insights are dry and old and no different than what drives any body to do anything. We all seek happiness because we are unhappy and there is always an underlying stress or anxiety about this. So why do some people collect? Or eat too much, or ski, or sky dive, or on an on and on. EVERYONE does SOMETHING to seek because they feel insecure and not sustained in the Universe. So collecting is not in the least unique.  It's the same reason Mr. Muensterberger wrote this book - he is seeking in his own way. It's as simple as that. I will be returning this boring book 
 Watching this film reminded me of how T-Rex swindled a bunch of screaming girls into believing he was the second coming of the Beatles. When in fact he was the inspiration for the Bay City Rollers and all the bad pop music that came after him. Interviews with producer Tony Visconti are so over the top it's pathetic. Visconti compares Bolan with Hendrix, the Beatles and has the audacity to say that he, Bowie and Thin Lizzy "wrote the book on British rock". Laughable.   For fun keep your eye on Bolan's guitar playing. His basic technique is playing an A7 chord incessantly and bursting into random three note lead runs that are comical. 
 Unless you live in Montana or are very familiar with the State, then this book will be of little use.  Get yourself a good guide book and a detailed map.  Montana is a beautiful state, but this book was not helpful on our recent trip.  And it's a very dull read, in my humble opinion.  Pass 
 I have always had first alert smoke alarms and they always worked great and lasted for what seems like forever, in fact, i have never had a smoke alarm die, until now.  When I moved into my aparment 10 years ago, my first alert smoke alarm was there already and to this day, it still works.  I only changed the alarm because of new laws. A year after I started using this one, it died on me.  I was very disappointed in the longevity of the product 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 My daughter rented this video from our local library, hoping it was an animated version of a story from her favorite author.  We were both sorely disappointed at the result.  This video covers three books by Dr. Suess; The Cat in the Hat Comes Back, Fox in Socks and There's a Wocket in my Pocket.  The video does not present animated versions of the books.  The camera shows stills from the books while off-screen actors read the text.  In a sense it is like the video reads the book to the children, except there are no words to actually be seen.  Overall this video serves little purpose.  Animated verisons of Dr. Suess's stories present dynamic and engaging visuals, and generally try to give a visual exploration of the text of the story.  As there is no true animation here there is no engagement that would no be obtained from reading the book.  At least the actors remain true to the original text, and we are not subjected to nauseating "improvements" of Dr. Suess's work, as in certain recent live action films.  Where the video really fails though is the loss of the visual text.  These books were written to be read to children to first of all introduce them to the concept of printed words having meaning, and second of all to inspire children to want to learn to read.  This video presents books with no words, and thus fails its target audience on both counts.    My personal conclusion is this; I cannot recommend this video to parents or educators.  It doesn't engage the viewer like an animated feature, nor will it inspire a love of reading.  I would recommend instead that people get the books and read them to their children.  Doing this will provide the children with benfits that this dreary video could never hope to achieve 
 I am surprised by the glowing reviews posted because I found the book shallow, incomplete and devoid of any useful detail.  Of course the price is very low, but paying anything for something that has no value is no bargain.  It was probably worth the $4 I paid for it, but that may be debatable 
 It's been said that the difference between a mediocre author and a good one is a good editor, and the same goes for the difference between good and great and great and outstanding.  In all cases, the editor has to be the better of the two. In Kenneth C. Davis' case, a mediocre author had a mediocre editor.  He's good at collecting facts, but not so good at verifying them.  One that really bugged me was on page 314:  "Invisible to the naked eye, Uranus was not discovered until 1781, the first planet to be observed by telescope."  Yet, in the period 1609-1613, Galileo observed the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn (though he could not recognize the rings for what they were).  Davis' editor should have had him say that Uranus was the first planet to be DISCOVERED (not OBSERVED) by telescope.  This is but one of many similar annoyances.  The author seems to be better at copyrighting a title and carving a niche than carefully choosing his words and checking his facts 
 I have only one question about this movie. And that is, Why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book?   If you haven't read the book than you don't know what I'm talking about. But if you have, then you do.  I can't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would've been if it had been adapted correctly. Half the time while watching this, I felt as if I was watching Teletubies or something, the colors were so bright.  If this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes, locations, characters, and details from the story,then EVERYONE would love it. Not just 5 year olds.   It makes me so angry when I watch this movie. Yes, its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing. Everytime I loan someone the book, I have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all. In fact, it is a hundred times better. More even.   I am really disappointed. I just don't get how Gail Carson Levine would agree to all the changes that were made. If someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie, than I suggest they do it right. And if they do, then I'll be very thankful.  I just don't get it. The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. You wouldn't believe how much better it is.   I am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book. Next time, please, please, do it right 
 This book is not up to the quality of How the Irish Saved Civilization.  Too much of his writing is merely quoting sources.  Actually it is rather boring 
 Season three of Enterprise is one of the primary reasons the show was cancelled.  Ratings dropped during this season and the announcement of the show's cancellation came before the superior season 4 could save it.  The problem with season three is that nearly every episode deals directly with the Xindi threat.  Long story arcs have happened in Star Trek before, such as the Dominion Wars in DS9.  The problem with the Xindi arc is that there are too few "change of pace" episodes.  Having three out of every four episodes about the same stroyline is boring.  There was not enough variety in this season.  It became quite redundant and I was quite happy when it ended.  Plus, there was no real suspense.  It was obvious that Earth was not going to be destroyed, so the outcome was not enough to keep one on the seat of his/her pants.  Season 4 was much better, but unfortunately couldn't save the show.  The idea of shorter story arcs was excellent, given the poor ratings they got in the previous season.  These mini-arcs were somewhat unique in the world of Star Trek, but worked much better than the mega-arc that was season 3 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I use to Love Maxtor. Still Have one from 1999. so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers. Well, The darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone. I did have a lot of it backed up but still, what a pain. Now that Seagate owns them, spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive. OR get a couple of these and RAID them. but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping 
 Information you already know, mixed with the same retro style as a dozen other books you can buy more cheaply. YAWN 
 I bought this thinking that it would work better than scooping kitty litter into a small trash bag and tying it off and then placing it in the trash.  I was WRONG.  This does not hold much waste and takes up un-necessary space.  If you want to buy something for your soiled kitty litter get a diaper genie and throw your trash bags of waste in that.  I have three cats and have to empty this Litter keeper at least every other day.  I wish I never bought it 
 I purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th Grade. I am very glad that I read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it. This book is about gang violence (although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders.)  The book is also about angry, jaded, hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes.   The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)   Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.   The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is. Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)  I knew that it was questionable whether or not I would allow my son to read this book.  I read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book.  There isn't.   This is the first book that I have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else. Save your money.  I don't care how many awards this book received.  It is pure trash 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I had to struggle to get through this one.  The plot was terribly predictable and all the mythology references got tiring quickly. The plot seemed to be just one cliche after another...it didn't really offer anything unique.  I guess I just expected more from Prescott after reading 'In Dark Places', where the last 200 pages of that book was some of the best reading I have ever done.  The premise for 'Comes the Dark' was really good...I just don't feel he tried hard enough to give us a compelling storyline.  I would recommend 'In Dark Places' over this one 
 I expected this book to be about PARENTING an only child per its title and was disappointed. Susan Newman did touch on some important issues such as teaching sharing and respectfulness and avoiding loneliness, although there wasn't a lot of meat to the chapters on these subjects. She also discussed being careful not to have excessive expectations of an only child, which I found interesting. However, a great deal of this book was devoted to justifying the decision to have an only child. If you're struggling with your family planning choices and would like someone to tell you repeatedly you're doing the right thing, you may enjoy this book. At this point, I don't need justification, I need information on addressing relevant issues so that I can be the best possible parent to my child. I also do not need reasons why my decision to have an only child is "superior" to the paths other families choose and was a little disturbed by the author's tone. Bottom line: this book effectively identifies some concerns of parents of only children, but I will be looking elsewhere for more substantial parenting support 
 Grandma bought the Curious George "DVD" for my 2 children and their cousin.  We popped it in to our DVD player and tried using our DVD remote and it didn't work.  I read the package and the box and nowhere does it tell you "Only for use with the Read With Me Controller".  Even at the Fisher Price website it is not explained very articulately.  Apparently you need to purchase a $25 "system" (aka-special remote control) that you program to interface with your own home DVD remote control and DVD player.  
 This text is required for a course in Cross Cultural Counseling for a Masters Program at NYU.  I find it deeply disturbing that a book filled with stereotypes of all races, ethnicities and cultures is being used to allegedly foster a deeper consideration of culture in counseling situations.  The only positive thing I can say is that it is equally offensive to everyone - no race or culture is spared.  The "culturally incompetent white counselor", the "powerless" african american, the "family-oriented (and always late) Puerto Rican, the "confused" multiracial, the "collectivist" Asian American... the list goes on and on.  Many of the studies cited are dated, while others are recitations of other work done by - you guessed it - Sue and Sue.  I urge anyone who is required to use this textbook to challenge their professors - it may lead to some productive dialogue about race, ethnicity, culture and counseling.  Otherwise, this text is an insulting waste of time 
 The reviews all sounded so good I couldn't resist. I was hoping for another "Memoirs of a Geisha" but boy, was I disappointed. The story bounces all over the place, never seems to have a consistent theme and finally, turns out to be just plain boring. I'll give the author some credit; the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in Asia myself, I enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era. Unfortunately, the budding story of a war hero's longing for a very young girl (he refers to her as the "Changeling") made the guy come off looking like a pedophile. Seriously, pretentious readers will love this drivel; too bad I can't recover the hours I wasted on this schlock.  With any luck, it'll be another 20 years before 'ol Shirley picks up her pen again. 
 This book was an anthology of 19 stories. I didn't like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head. I had to read almost every paragraph over. I could not comprehend at all 
 It's a great idea poorly executed. I've set up LOTS of wireless networks and devices. I know what I'm doing and I'm telling you that the WMB54G Music Bridge is NOT ready for mass consumption. You can follow the directions on the CD over and over and it will complete and tell you that you've successfully configured the Bridge and then... nothing. It doesn't connect to your wireless network. Try it again. Success! Then No connection. Reconfigure your DHCP and your router and your modem. Reset everything to factory defaults. Turn off all firewalls.  Nothing works. So RTFM and find out it is written by an ESL. OEMing hardware is expected. OEMing documentation is a mistake. I expect better from Linksys/Cisco.  Other reviewers have said they've got it working after 10 hours of putzing. I've got better things to do with my free time. I hope you do too. Skip the Music Bridge.  Follow up  OK, so I did find 3 hours this morning to work with the WMB54G. Google told me that lots of people have the same problem with this unit. Before you buy it google "wmb54g ip". This device reminds me of when I worked for a computer company that I'll call Gatebay 2000. As the company began to really fail they started branding any piece of crud they could find just to make the sell. The New Products group had already been laid off.   My point is that maybe Linksys is having trouble and they can't take the time for QA. I am returning my WMB54G today and I'll try something else.  And lastly, my call to the "24/7" Linksys support line left me on hold for 44:29. Forty four minutes. Obviously hangtime is not one of their CS metrics 
 I am disgusted that you would even think to ask me what my thoughts are. I emailed you with a complaint that the copy I bought was listed as new. I complained that the page edges gave the appearance they had been torn using a ruler rather than guillatined. I was very disapointed with the book and even moreso that you failed to reply to my email - I have bought a few books fom you and intended to buy more but your professionalism is so lacking that I think from now on I'll shop elsewhere.

 The original Eloise was a sustained thrill. I have avoided all sequels until now for fear of just this sort of crashing disappointment. Think of the difference between Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, then multiply by ten. It is a bore. It is an embarassment. It is rawther godawful 
 Our family has greatly enjoyed the Scholastic Children's Dictionary, so it made sense to also get the Scholastic Children's Thesaurus.  What a disappointment!  Nearly every word my fourth grader looks up (for school work) is not in this book. It is pretty much useless for her school work.  Don't bother with it 
 I was extremely disappointed with this title in the sense that it is a one way only answer.  They do admit that the book is a great read but apparently everything Mr. Brown wrote is fiction based on his own delusions.  They also seem to point to Mr. Brown as the only person to ever make claims like the ones in his book.  I am an open-minded person and will gladly look into new ideas and possibilities.  This dvd made me feel like a fool to do so.  On the other hand, if you don't beleive anything in the book, then this dvd is for you.  It might also help to let everyone know that at the end of the presentation, the narrator tells you that if you want to know the whole truth, you should seek your answers in a book you probably already have at home... the bible.

 I am sorry that this book does not seem very useful to me.  This text is highly recommended by noted authorities in woodworking.  Much of the information seems very dated.  Other areas, such as descriptions of joints and specific types of dovetails seem to be too limited to be of use to a novice like myself.  I feel I wasted money on this purchase and I wish I could see the value that much better craftsman than myself place on it 
 I am a student majoring in Business Administration who recently used this text in an upper-level management course.  The book's writing is utterly superfluous.  Boredom was frequently my sentiment as I weeded through unnecessarily labyrinthine sentences.  The ideas in the book were occasionally interesting, but were usually ideas I had already developed on my own via simple intuition.  Perhaps the most valuable part of the text is the section of case studies.  This closing segment of the book contains many great ideas for student projects.  Overall, this text disappoints me as a studen 
 This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of "Oprah Book Club" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak.   
 very bad metal quality. Easy oxidize with white patina after every wash. First few grounded peaces always have black color.  Not worth buying 
 I went through three lessons before canning this CD.  The lessons were terrible!  Sometimes they stated the French word before the English word and sometimes afterward, which meant you could be learning the wrong word!  The pronounciations were nowhere near the way the French speak; they were like what a HS French teacher who'd learned from a book and never been to France would speak

 Jung is loopy. Jungian psychology is loopy. Jungian psychologists are  loopy. It surprises me that people take this stuff as seriously as they do.  Maybe there's a good Jungian explanation for that too. That said, Jung was,  in my opinion, the Wagner of early psychology, and, like Wagnerian opera,  there's a lot to be learned by mulling over some of the ideas presented  therein. But remember, Jung was more of a Romantic philosopher than a  psychologist. Colorful stuff. Just don't take it too seriously 
 Please tell me what's happened to this once glorious artist. Its been 13 yrs since Dionne released an album of new material, and this is what she has to offer. We don't need fresh versions of the songs presented here, they have been done to death, and I for one am sick and tired of hearing them.  If Dionne can't get it together to offer new material, what about at least covering some of the lesser known songs in the bacharach/david canon: "I just have to Breathe", "The Balance of Nature," "Whoever you are, I love you," "Forever my Love," "Be Aware." These are just a few of the hidden gems in the bacharach songbook, and in so many ways superior to the greatest hits Dionne contines to recylcle.  All I can say is, shame on you Dionne. You have one of the finest catalogues in pop music, and you continue to waste it on walk on by 
 We received our Kinyo UV-230C 2-way VHS rewinder/cleaner yesterday and tried it out today. The very first tape that we rewound (a much-loved Disney video) slammed against the beginning of the tape so hard that when we pulled the tape out it was hanging out of the cassette housing, crinkled. I'm afraid that repeated rewindings of a given tape could break the tape.  I had a blank T-120 tape so I put that in and fast-forwarded to the other end to see if it would happen in that direction. It did. I rewound that tape to the beginning and this time it ended properly, so this problem is not consistent.   The tape that was rewound initially was not a full 120-minute tape (the movie is 77 minutes long). I suspect that the sensors on the unit are calibrated for 120-minute tapes and will not necessarily treat shorter tapes as gently. (More tape = more weight = slower overall motor speed?) But I'm not going to experiment with tapes we want to keep! This unit will be returned ASAP. I may exchange it for another in hopes that this particular unit is out of whack. 
 I was looking for a Audio program that I could listen to in the car while commuting to wrok each day. This program is design to be listened to at the same time your reading the book. Regardless, I listened to the CDs without the book and noticed that a lot of the words I wished to learn (basics) were not covered. I ended up buying a reference dictionary and another audio program. 
 "For example, I feel that polygyny is morally wrong, but I recognize that a sizable fraction of the world's current population...would disagree with me.  While my own views are strongly held, I would be disinclined to try to impose my aversion to polygyny on peoples for whom it is a time-honored and respected practice."  At that point, I stopped reading this book further.  If the author can't 'impose' his views on others regarding multiple marriages, I wondered if he would have ever imposed his views on the those leading Enron, Tyco or Worldcom if they had sought his counsel?  Even up to this point in the book, I felt that the author's views were not applicable to the business world where we often don't have the luxury of time and distance that the author does in formulating his opinions.  I'm also disappointed in Warren Bennis' advocacy for this book as I'm a big fan of Bennis' books and have read most of them.  Now, I will have to be more careful about books Mr. Bennis recommends.  There are far better leadership books in the market than this one.  My copy is going straight in the trash 
 Only 38 pages into this book, I've had to put it down in sheer awe of how utterly inaccurate this book is.   From the questions it suggests you ask a prospective pediatrician to the AAP's "neutral" view on circumcision, this book is obviously written in a very biased undertone.   Thankfully, I got this from the library. All I have to do is return it and try and forget the bad, bad information it provided.   Keep looking 
 I have never paid this much for a book with poor grammer and editing in nearly every page. Perhaps because the material is cutting edge they chose to rush this book to print. Not only is the copy bad, there are many places (like the entire appendix) where figures are referenced but do not exist. Despite this, the book contains some great information about the emerging security threats to web services and some measures you can take to preempt them. I applaud the author for his technical content, but the book itself needs a lot of work before you should pay this much for it 
 This could have been a fabulous story with interesting and compelling characters. Instead, we have another self-indulgent wallow in the world of fox-hunting and so-called gracious southern living. I gave up on Rita Mae Brown several years ago when she stopped writing inventive and intriguing novels and started writing stories about talking animals. Recently I picked up Hotspur hoping some of the old zing had come back into her writing. Sadly, it hasn't 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.  While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging.. 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 The major part of this book is made up of two page wide, single line entries for each fund. Entries consist of the usual stats available for free on-line. It would be worth the price to have this information neatly bound in a book - if the data was current, but it isn't. November 1998 mutual fund data is not much use in November 2001 (will this bull market ever end?). No fault of the authors - but not a good buy now 
 If your school uses this book, not only don't take this class, drop out of the school. If I could rate this with negative numbers I would. This is the worst textbook ever devised by man OR woman. If you are already a CPA looking for a review, it might be worth something, otherwise it teaches nothing. It presents examples without first explaining things then explains things using examples that have no bearing on what is being taught.  If you have to use this book, my sympathy for you. I can only hope the school will refund at least a portion of my money 
 This book isnt worth the money you pay for it. It's only the ladys negative opinions on EVERYTHING without any facts or real information. 
 What a lousy writer. If he didn't complain about everything and then get drunk and call himself a poet, we'd all call him an annoying, whiny drunk

 I am not a fan of this book. He begins by saying Do not use complicated words when a simple one will do. Then he continues by using complicated words throughout the entire book. He proceeds by telling the reader to do everything they were told not to do: use "I" and start sentences with "but." He is the only person I have heard of that is pro "I" and I refuse to do poorly on future essays because he likes it whereas no one else does. Much of his style is completely subjective--he doesn't explain well why he likes some phrases and dislikes others. One thing I'm sure of, no matter what I'd write, he'd hate it, including this review. In my opinion, the author can be described by words he uses frequently in the book: pompous and utterly (he'd say that word is unecessary but oh, I think it is) pretentious 
 Far from user-friendly, you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks, wondering "Why did I get this program again?" Its like reading another language after using previous editions of Word, which I was a big fan of. I guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it's a nuisance. I can't find anything on this toold bar that looks like an airplane cockpit. In the words of Thoreau "Simplify." Good luck sending files as attachments to colleagues-they won't be able to view the newere version. Get used to saving in "97-2003 Word Format."

 That's a direct quote from O'reilly. Instead he prefers to make inflammatory statements and and a lot of  misleading suggestions. It's hard to know what he actually likes, because he appears to make a living based on negativity and rage. (bad guys, ad nauseum). It's all tedious angry white male "daddy knows best" posturing. He wants his readers to see him as he sees himself: a tough oh-so-virile guy, who's true to his working class roots, despises privelege, and is grossly insulted by lables, e.g. "conservative."  When he dislikes, he rages, e.g. single mothers, George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Whitney Houston. He despises the Clintons, but he's hard pressed after all the revelations about the Arkansas Project to say why they are amoral so he just tells you they spend a lot of money, (which actually pales in comparison to Reagan and the noaccountability whopping spending of G.W., but he doesn't tell you that.) He dogs Bill Moyers ad nauseum.    Aside from rage, the book contains a lot of weird, frightening illogical stuff. He believes teenagers who were caught in the act should have been "publicly disciplined" (??) He believes Clinton's Torricelli deal led to 9/11 (&doesn't mention anything else that might have.) He tells Phil Donahue, that if he was in charge, he "would not target the civilians of Afghanistan, but bomb the infrastructure" of the country. (Huh? bombing the infrastructure does kill civilians.) He's obsessed with sex offenders and child abuse, which is weird given his own record. He's obsessed with "immorality" in the media & society, & its really disturbing the way the way he targets celebrities who are black as paragons of "immorality. " There is nothing enjoyable about this book. It's bleak. It's negative and twisted. The book is so grotesque, it's not even amusing to read as satire of a right wing ideologue 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 I usually only feel compelled to write reviews for books that move me. Well, this one certainly did--to the bathroom to THROW UP! This insultingly unintelligent book is chock-full of every cliche known to man (or should I say woman). From leg-humping dogs to French dreamboats, The Botox Diaries is about as cleverly written as a fart joke. As an avid reader, I try to finish a book even if I don't like it. Well, there is an exception to every rule! What a waste of time 
 You loved Ender's Game, right?  And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean.  Terrific.  Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.  It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books.  The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).  This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.  It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It hardly makes any sense at all.  Beware 
 This book looked adorable, so I borrowed it from our library and pre-read it, before sharing it with my 4 year old daughter.  Good thing I did!  At the end the little girls says she is allowed to say things she really doesn't mean (which is I am sorry) - what a horrible lesson to teach!!  "Remember kids, you can get out of anything if you fake remorse and lie to your loved ones!"  Parents be forewarned...it's not a book on morals and may even negate what you are trying to teach.  
 I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her.  I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth.  In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing.  To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing.  I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level.  There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one 
 I did not like this book because it had the most boring mysteries I have ever read.Like most boring books,the kids go somewhere, find what there looking for and, in the case of this book, fly back on a horse with wings.They say boring things along the lines of "how did you learn to read and write?My opinion is that it is a very boring book 
 The first Saw movie was like a breathe of fresh air to the genre.  It wasn't a PG-13 rated teen fest or a remake of a classic 70's horror film either, and while it wasn't perfect, it still managed to deliver the goods with a little bit of originality thrown in.  Saw II picks up where the first film left off, with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing another game with a group of people; among whom is survivor Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the son (Erik Knudsen) of crooked detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is forced to play along as well.  Replacing James Wan as director, Darren Lynn Bousman ups the ante in terms of grotesqueness and the design of Jigsaw's game, but the story (originally based on an older story by Bousman that was later transformed into Saw II) isn't close to being as engaging as it was the first time around, and besides Bell, Smith, and Wahlberg; the rest of the cast (including a returning Dina Meyer, along with Glen Plummer, 7th Heaven's Beverly Mitchell, Franky G, and Emmanuelle Vaugier) range from grating to awful.  There's some pretty good gore effects, and the scenarios offer some imagination, but Saw II is a far step down from the original.  All in all, Saw II isn't horrible, but it's definitely the worst entry in the series by far 
 The concept is nice ... 802.11g camera.  However there are some fundamental flaws with the design.  The streaming of the video is too heavy-weight for the 802.11g.  A simple ping shows hops in excess of 800ms.  As soon as I stop streaming, it is about 16ms ... which means the cams processor is overloaded.    The stream is very choppy.  As for pan / tilt ... only works 25% of the time.  The video always streams (which means there is connectivity), but when I issue pan/tilt commands, only 25% of the time does it respond to my commands.  I bought this as a toy ... to put in the front window to see who is there, while I am working in my home office.  I don't see how someone would / could use this for practical monitoring.  The picture is very choppy, not very clear, and doesn't respond to commands.  Considering Linksys is owned by Cisco ... this hit the market without any real quality assurance.  This is hardly useable.  2 thumbs down.  Come'on Cisco ... get your act together.  You are leaving room for someone to come in and do it better.  I will be returning this, and may buy the panasonic 
 I couldn't even finish this movie, it was just aweful, please avoid this.  I found myself skipping through the chapters waiting for things to happen.. 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 I ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters. I got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind, not at all like the ones shown. The shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going to pay to send them back. I never got an e-mail about the substituation or response to my calls or e-mail to the company. I will not buy any thing else from them 
 The cover is a great visual representation of progressions and the relationship between chords.    However the text is unclear GIBBERISH.    There are a few gems of information deeply buried beneath condescending inferences that you should ALREADY KNOW this, TRUST ME on that, or JUST TRY IT and it will work.  This book doesn't teach theory, it CONFUSES an average student  It would be better to have just the cover and a one page explanation of its usage on the back- that would be worth $5, but at this cost it is not worth it 
 The oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case. And the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil.   Maybe you'll find this product wonderful and a cost-effective alternative, what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine? A small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil. 
 This movie won the Razzie award for Worst Motion Picture of 1994. Oddly enough though, it didn't win in any of the other "worst of" categories. This really says something about the film. The fact is, it is just hard to point to any one or even combination of factors of why it is so bad. It's not that any one particular performance is bad or an actor or actress is miscast or that there is particularly cheesy dialogue as is so often the case in a "bad film".  It's just that the whole thing comes together to form a whole lot of nothing. It's more what isn't in the film than what is in it that makes it mediocre. Sure, the ending is unexpected, but it would also be unexpected if I found an extra broom when I was cleaning out my closet. That wouldn't make it remarkable, interesting, or even noteworthy. Because I never grew to care about the characters I couldn't be expected to care about the ending. The film is trying to be a psychological thriller with Willis as the protagonist trying to unravel the mystery. What comes out over the duration of the film are just many seemingly disjointed odd events meant to shock but just don't form any kind of cohesive plot. Instead we have what could have been a strong cast of characters in good performances spending the whole film trying to figure out exactly who they are supposed to be. The explicit love scenes between Willis and Jane March are just annoying more than anything as they seem to scream "This is a consolation prize to make up for the fact that you're sitting through such a bad film". 
 This book is filled with 4-letter words. The "f" word is used throughout.  The premise of the story is a teen girl turns into a fly, and goes into the boys locker room.  She describes in detail, boys' anatomy, and a large part of the book is spent describing boys' genitals, and how she feels upon seeing them. She also discusses how seeing the naked boys makes her want to pounce on them and stick her tongue down their throats.    My 12 year old daughter picked this book up out of the children's room in our local library.  It has a cheerful, little-girlish pink cover.  My daughter thought that it was going to be a fun adventure story of a girl who turns into a fly.  It is an adventure story, but an x-rated one.  Fortunately, my daughter stopped reading, and brought the book to me when she encountered the first 4-letter words on the first pages.  I highly object to this book being marketed to CHILDREN, when between the girly-pink cover it is undisguised, blatant pornography.  While I do not care what other adults read in the privacy of their own homes, to have this book being marketed for children is unethical, immoral by any standards, and should be illegal.    You have to be 18 to purchase pornography.  You should have to be 18 to purchase this book 
 	I did not enjoy reading this book.  I had to force myself to finish it and at the same time avoid ripping out my hair due to boredom.  The only character I liked was McMurphy.  It was interesting to see the way he was able to impact each character in the book with his antics and ideas.  Admittedly at some parts of the book I was uncomfortable reading about what went on in the asylum, and I think this was kind of the point, so the book was successful there.  To me, the most important aspect of the book was, as Medgar Evers once said, "You can kill a man but you can't kill an idea."  One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest demonstrates the power an idea can have over people, and how even if you cannot see the idea in action, once it has been introduced it will survive.  
 I was encouraged by friends to buy this because they said she was the greatest female singer on Broadway today. I was very disappointed. She is mostly on a Harold arlen kick and she is definitely not the right singer for that material. After hearing Streisand  (and only in her early 20's at the time) cover most of this material you will understand why. There is no comparison. While Audra has a great voice on her own - she is not a good pop singer and comes across as emotionless and cold.  
 Investment Biker: 1-1/2 stars, just barely escapes the lowest possible rating.  This is a book about what a Tom Wolfe-style Master of the Universe does on holiday. It's nearly impossible to have an "adventure" when you are carrying 10(!) platinum credit cards. He got cold and wet a few times, worried about finding gas, didn't always have hotel rooms up to his standards, and had delays at some borders, yawn.  The adventure must have been resisting the urge to buy an airline ticket back to New York using one of his many Visa cards.  I rode a bicycle around the world for 19 months at about the same time Mr. Rogers was having his "adventure." I am stunned that he perceived so little in his long travels.  I don't know how someone could travel in foreign countries that extensively and end up completely unchanged by the experience.  However, this fits perfectly with his huge arrogance, which is truly the theme of the book.  He already knows it all and will tell you all about it.  Which makes one wonder:  why did he bother to leave NY City in the first place?  I guess it was a good opportunity to pose with and boink the attractive and young (naive and pliable? -- certainly lubricious) daughter of one of his clients.  And a good opportunity to pump himself up by feeling superior to all those "brown faces" he's driving through.  The arrogance, the arrogance!  Typical privileged, right-wing know-it-all.  I'd like to see him try to survive in the Peruvian highlands without all his money and fancy equipment.  This is not a travel book: Mr. Rogers uses his trip as a way to sell a long economic rant. You can save yourself a lot of time by just reading his final chapter, "Afterword." I will summarize his position: governments are bad; smart, rich guys like me are good (remember October 1929?). Many of his predictions are laughably wrong. He advocated selling the US economy short in 1993.  Look at the US stock market performance from 1993 through 2000 ...  Gosh!  Idiot!  Some reviews are touting his prescience on markets.  Hello?  How about his predictions on the biggest economy in the world?  Mr. Rogers' writing is very poor and it's loaded with cliche's. He and Tabitha are always zooming on "powerful steeds" into "gorgeous scenery", or "steep, craggy mountains" into "glitzy, glamorous hotspots" or "delightful, cozy hostels", or across "hot, empty, flat deserts" into "dumps" that are not up to American standards. He'll "describe" one of the greatest mountain chains on earth, the Andes, as "the top of the world" (p. 315) for five short sentences and then move on to more important matters like further adventures with border guards and investing.  Great writing?  Rubbish!  I think he used a computer program to come up with his "descriptions" of the places he went.  Mr. Rogers is woefully ignorant about the places he goes - and he doesn't learn anything along the way. He views the world exclusively through the keyhole of economics. Most of the "interesting facts" he mentions about theses places are just wrong. One indicative example: He describes the Moreno Glacier in Argentina as, "one of the few in the world still moving." (p. 294) I found myself laughing out loud many times at his "facts" and descriptions.  If you want to understand the distribution of goods in the world, read "Guns, Germs, and Steel," by Jared Diamond. If you want to read about a real motorcycle trip, read Ted Simon's "Jupiter's Travels," or Robert Fulton's, "One-Man Caravan."  For good travel books, try:  "Seven Years in Tibet" (Harrer), "News from Tartary" (Fleming), "Arabian Sands" (Thesiger), "Gypsy Moth Circles the World" (Chichester), "Sailing Around the World" (Slocum), "Motoring With Mohammed" (Hanson), "Full Tilt" (Murphy), "A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush" (Newby), or "Eastern Approaches" (MacLean) "My Life with the Eskimo" (Stefansson), "Endurance" (Lansing).  I could go on and on.  "Investment Biker" is poorly-written drivel compared to all these and so many more.  "Investment Biker," a classic? That's ridiculous.  From another review:  "Greatest Book on Finance, Business, Travels Ever"  That comment almost leaves me speechless.  Obviously written by someone who has read very few travel books indeed 
 After "Lazarus Long" I had high expectations for this audio book.  It seems, however, that Heinlein "lost it" between 1946 and 1961!  The book starts out interestingly enough but once VMS goes out on his own, it becomes a joke!  Heinlein's endless anti-religion, diatribes, voiced through the mouths of VMS and the insufferable "Jubal Hershaw" made me want to chew my leg off, just to get away!  (Apologies to "Hitchiker's Guide!")  I stuck it out though, hoping for a "second wind," but there was no wind, just a SUCKING sound! Jubal is basically Marvin the Robot on downers! Any real person with his outlook would've eaten a gun LONG ago.  VMS is an "Ubermench" strung out on Qualludes!  "I grock this...I grock that...I grock grocking..." Blah Blah Blah.  I didn't grock this book at all! The final scene wherein VMS allows himself to be vivisected reminded me of the "Black Knight" scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail"..."It's only a flesh wound!" Oh, and lastly, what's with Foster and Digby and VMS himself in some sort of weird afterlife "adjusting their halos!?"  Methinks Heinlein may have discovered Acid in his later life. Bottom line, a waste of 16 hours of my time...thank God (yes, THAT God!) I didn't have to pay for it

 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 As a feminist, I hate movies that portray women as victims who struggle futile against the big bad evil MAN.  There are no good men in this movie.  There are no evil women.   Such portrayals of women are demeaning.  We are human beings, just like men.  We are capable of evil.  Men are capable of good.  Yes, some men would turn their wives into robots if they could, but so would some women!  And I find it ridiculous that not one man stood up for his beloved partner.  I find it ridiculous that not one woman was capable of true evil.  Are we puppets?  It also bothers me that if these women are so strong and powerful, that they are helpless against the big bad men.  The message seems to be that we can't save ourselves.  We are just doomed to be what men want us to be.  I hate this attitude.  Men are not all powerful.  Women are human beings, not saints.    Two stars, though, for capturing the fears of women everywhere 
 I have read many books on WWII from many perspectives and have been to visit the D-Day beaches four times. I cannot visit the American graves in Normandy without being moved. Twice I have had the experience of hearing taps played near Omaha Beach. I have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died. I had high expectations for the book. My problem is that the book never finds its voice. At times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men. I wanted to hear more from this man. Just as he starts to share, the general leaps in and throws off the narrative. Let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different. (A few photos and maps would be nice). If the general needs to talk, give him a separate chapter at the end of the book. We hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels. Their voices could add to the history. I wish the colonel would have spoken for them 
 I bought the book, based on previous positive critics here (Amazon).  The implication was that this book covers the new features of SQL Server 2005.  Well, the first one that I was looking for, the PIVOT (crosstab) is not even mentioned, let alone covered even briefly.  I did not search all the new features, but if you want a book that cover both old and new features, this one is certainly NOT the one that you should look for. The publisher rep tried to tell me that no one book could cover all subjects.  This is true, but for a book that specialize in T-SQL and T-SQL only, the features should have been covered, or, at least mentioned briefly. I've found books that cover the new features only, or the old features only.  The quest is not over for me, yet. Z 
 Many of the books are old and out of date editions. some of the info is useful but a more current set of manuals would have been nice. I will absorb what is useful and forget the rest. 
 Ms. Hawke creates an interesting 'live' vampire here, but he is the only good thing about this book. The author's use of descriptors [spec. colors] with EVERYTHING do not seem that of a professional writer.   As for being erotic, well the few love scenes were slightly steamy but nothing to write home about.   This is obviously a planned series as there are so many loose strings left at the end its a wonder my book didn't unravel. Read it in one sitting and donated it to the library the next day. Maybe I can save someone from wasting their money on it... 
 I really wanted to like this book. I bought it to read with my 9-year old because she and I are so interested in Pirate stories. I am also a fan of Dave Barry and so thought this would be fun for both her and I.   However, like many parents, I decided to read some of it alone to make sure that it was appropriate for her age and her sensibility. My husband and I are not prudish by any means. But we do feel a need to preserve childhood for our kids as much as possible and shelter them from that which they do not know or need to know at such young ages.   And I am so glad that I read a few chapters before sharing this book with her as it is HIGHLY inappropriate.   For example, there is a Captain Slank in this book that at one point is flirting with a governess named Mrs. Bumbrake. It is innocent enough at first. He meerly gets excited at seeing a flash of her naked ankle. But later Peter (Pan) hears the two engaged in the following:     "Oh, Mr. Slank!" she was saying. "You are the devil!" "That I am, Mrs. Bumbrake!" boomed Slank. "And you know what they say!" "WHat do they say, Mr.Slank?" "They say," roared Slank, "the devil take the hindmost!" Then Peter heard Mrs. Bumbrake emit a very un-governess-like squeal, followed by what sounded like a slap, followed by some thumping, then more squealing, then more thumping, and then much laughing. From the sound of it, Peter figured they wouldn't be breaking up the party any time soon.  OH MY! I don't think they were playing checkers! And I am certainly not going to put myself in a position of having to explain this to a 9-year old ...(which is the suggested audience age for this book, by the way)... nor do I think it is appropriate or necessary for a book like this. It is published by Disney for crying out loud!  So, for parents who are pro-active in securing a nurturing, peaceful, unsexualized childhood for your kids, stay clear of this book. It was only on page 55 that I found this inappropriate scene. I imagine there are more 
 This author must think all Americans have nothing better to do but read the gossip columns or watch soap operas and want the French vocabulary to go with such behaviors.  A major portion of this book covers romance-horoscopes and other vapid matters. The author insults my intelligence with her choice of topics.  In addition, Ms. Heminway uses vocabulary in her pieces not defined in the book's glossary or pages of text which further frustrates the reader.  A wonderfully, unusable text!  
 Hard as it is to do, this film manages to make Jet Li look very, very bad. I kept having Karate Kid flashbacks! The story is the same old, same old, American martial arts move cliches, fighting for honor and all...in a place that is obviously NOT Los Angeles. The real disappointment is that the martial artists( in come cases obviously just local students for God sake!) are sub par and the choreography suffers for it. The action sequences are slow and awkward. Pass on this one guys 
 After clicking 1 click order i found out that this cartridge was not shipped from Amazon [ I was going to order both black and color ]. I immediatly e-mailed the shipper to cancel the order [ inside 1 hour], I received a e-mail in return that the item was already scanned and could not be canceled. I kept the ink cartridge and went to Staples and bought the black cart. The same color cart was available at a cheaper price less than Amazon's private vendor. I probably will not use 1 click shopping again 
 I recently received this as a Christmas gift, and it didn't work from the start. After much time wasted with their "tech support" the device was deemed defective. Their tech support is very poor - all they could say, "try another Xd card". The device kept freezing my system, the driver that came with the software didn't work, a very frustrating experience. If the tech support was more informative or supportive, Lexar might have redeemed itself. I recently purchased the Sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm, right from the start. Their quick start guide is much more detailed, and their software works! Save yourself a headache and buy Sandisk 
 I am giving Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock a single star because it has been revered as "the" book on this master director for way too long.   I first read this book years ago as a new student of film and Hitchcock.  Since that time I have read lots more about Hitchcock and with each new piece of the puzzle, have determined after re-reading it recently that there is little that is new or exclusive to this book.  Hitchcock often told the same stories elsewhere, both before and after publication of this book some thirty plus years ago.  The books sole value is as an entertainment, or as a Hitchcock-primer.  This book merely provides what Hitchcock wanted to say of himself, the packaged image, just like his famous caricature.  There are many other books to choose from which offer a more complete portrait.  Seek them out .. 
 An insight for anyone who hasn't read this book:  In one sentence, Ed is praising a police officer for being honest and hard working.  On the very next page, Ed is stealing people's brand new harleys which probably took them their whole lives to save up for. Make your own judgement... Ed, you are one messed up man 
 I've enjoyed other works by this artist, so I purchased "Christmas and Sante Fe" without listening to it first.  What a mistake.  It's what I call motivational music.  It makes me want to do something else 
 While living in Rio I once asked my Marine Corps buddy Paul Y- why he thought Brazil never could get ahead.  He pondered for a moment then said: "Brazil is the only country that respects sociologists."  I didn't fully appreciate what he meant until I saw Bus 174, a film loaded with the blatherings of sociologists and social workers explaining the root causes of why a glue-sniffing, cocaine-snorting, fugitive thief named Sandro shot and killed an innocent girl on a Rio bus in a botched holdup.  Then I understood.  When you've got a Constitution that says no one under 18 can be held criminally liable for anything (Article 228), you come to realize that you're in the grips of a sociological experiment gone horribly, horribly awry, that you're living in a nightmare of supremely stupid paternalistic sixties' utopianism, in a society with prescriptions for social problems wholly unconnected to reality or actual human behavior.  Watch this film and you'll see this ethos in its full twisted glory, from a bogus examination of root causes, to dimestore Freudian psychology, to neo-Marxist analysis.  Ironically, it's that last analysis that really has any traction.  Poor kids got to eat too, and if they steal to get food, it's at least understandable (c.f. Prov. 6:30).  When you steal to buy cocaine, however, then my compassion ends, as does the compassion of most people who are grounded in reality and common sense.  In short, look for a lot of handwringing about why a young man would go nuts and kill a hostage, interspersed with victim, relative and police testimonials that are interesting and sometimes informative.  The incompetence of the police in the situation is staggering.  They must have had 50 chances for a perfect head shot and never took it.  What a disgrace for all concerned.  As for the fact that the cops who suffocated Sandro beat the rap, well that's why jury nullification was invented.  Since we're on this same general subject, may I share a true confession with you?  First, some background.  I was an observer to the precursor to the Candelaria Massacre.  Because I didn't have a car at the time, twice a week I walked from Ilha das Cobras through Praca Pio X (where the Candelaria Church is located) to get to the...well, to get to a building located on Av. Presidente Roosevelt.  On July 23, 1993, I happened to be walking through Pio X in the afternoon and saw the commotion as the cops rounded up a bunch of kids while others taunted the cops and threw rocks at the patty wagon.  That of course was the genesis of the cops' determination for payback later that night.  My confession: before the massacre walking through Pio X scared the hell out of me because of all the street kids, one of whom I once saw stealing an old man's watch off his wrist.  Walking through Pio X after the massacre, I never feared for my safety again.  Infer from my confession what you will. 
   I bought this watch about 7 months ago and had all the issues listed to some degree or anouther but all in all it was still a good watch for the price.  That is untill 5 days ago when all the digital functions on the watch quit and then a day later went blank leaving me with a standard watch. But I guess you get what you pay for 
 Ok- so I can see there are some die-hard Julia Roberts fans out there.  Too bad.  Just raving about her will never improve her acting skills (an oxymoron). Actually, the poor quality of this movie is astounding, considering its director, the cast (excepting our girl Julia) and the book upon which it was based. Though he's done some much better work, when Pakula threw this film together he was clearly thinking of only one thing:  "Hmm, 'Presumed Innocent' was a winner. Let's follow that same formula and do another one. It'll sell." Unfortunately, by the time the story from the book by John Grisham got to the screen, it lacked any of its original punch.  As for Denzel, he should be ashamed of himself. He's about as enthusiastic in this as a turtle heading for the beach. I guess he probably needed the cash for another house.  Then again, he's opposite Julia. No further comment needed  -other than, save your money 
 The book came as described in excellent shape and arrived quickly.  I hate the book though. The rhymes are not very good. Just a few variations of words but nothing to really jump rump for a long period of time to. I was hoping for some of the playground rhymes I can't remember from childhood. It seemed like somebody just wrote down some words that sorta rhymed but had no reason. 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 I don't so much mind the money I wasted on this book, it's the time that bothers me. Bill Rancic, you're fired 
 What's with all the titles using the word Fantastic?  Wow, that's so original!  Did you write that yourself?  Anyway, I was disappointed with this one, like many others here.  I thought it was a big waste of time and talent.  I would have liked to have more of a plot-line set up, and some type of comarardarie between the Fantastic Four.    But this slack was garbage.    I would not rent or purchase this movie.  MC White said:  Not F.... darn it, I almost did the same thing 
 And I thought I WAS a die-hard Conrad fan!  He's one of those writers by whom I must read a book every two or three years -- but this one I did not like at all.  Despite the usual brilliant prose, much of it as good as  anything Conrad has done, "Tether" is a let-down -- astoundingly  depressing!  Most Conrad work posits a world that is inimical and uncaring,  yet holds out hope that courage and integrity will serve to help us endure  it all; "Tether" holds out no such hope.  It concerns a captain  who continues to pilot his ship even though he is legally blind, doing so  in order to provide for his family.  Nothing turns out okay, and no one  ends up happy.  I don't ask for a lot of hope from the books I read -- but  at least a little 
 Giroux's book restates much of what he says in his other books (only with a few Disney anecdotes added). It took him two pages to say what could have been said in two sentences, and I found those same two pages popping up over and over again. I grew tired as I read, I was looking for substance. By the time I was half way through, I was skimming looking for him to say something new (he didn't)  If you're looking for dirt on Disney, read Schweizer's "Disney: The mouse betrayed" Schweizer's book includes documentation of a pedophile problem at Disney, lack of safety at Disneyworld, Eisner dirt, criminal activity, Disney's link to porn.. 
 The reviews posted on the site are longer than the book. It is less than 100 pages long and about 1/4" thick. I know it is a "value" book but it's a tiny, quick read that would be more suitable to a Good Housekeeping magazine (granted not PG rated!) than a book 
 Here is another example of a good Commodities writer attempting to write about Day Trading Stocks. No only does he fail in this attempt but he has the nerve to criticize other writers. It is clear from the time periods of the charts (ten minuets) and the lack of discussion of NASDAQ level 2 that Jake is way out of his field. When will the pure commodity writers learn not to try and cash in on the interest in stocks? Fools rush in. Save your money.I returned the book 
 This book sounded wonderful from the 4 reviews I read, but I checked the Nefeli website, & discovered before & after pix from this book.  I was dismayed to see the dramatic difference in those pix are results of lighting conditions.    Most of the "before" shots show obvious shadows behind & slightly below each person's head, or under their chin--compared to the "after" shot where the light is totally different. You can easily see the difference in light placement by noticing the reflection in the eyes.  Manipulating lighting creates dramatic differences in shadows cast on the face, resulting in aging affects.  Ever notice the poor lighting in retail stores? It's the same effect when you're in their dressing rooms, or look in retail store mirrors.   The most flattering lighting is horizontally level with your mid-face, whereas overhead lighting casts unflattering shadows, accentuating lines & sagging.    It's a shame they had to resort to lighting "tricks" to sell this book. I can't help thinking of Dr. Perricone's books, I thought his program was wonderful--his skin looked terrific!  Then I read about his having had a FACE LIFT!  Buyer beware. 
 Why was this ever made? Just to make fans of the original mad? Rod Serling is rolling over in his grave. When I originally saw this in Burbank, CA, we were screaming and groaning at the screen 
 I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky.  This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere.  Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows.  This is my last Cromwell 
 The album is rushed, being produced just in 8 days.  It did not showcase Casey's talent and sales charts speak even louder. Poor Casey. She deserves a better album than this 
 This is more of a gift book.  It is gaggy.  It is cute enough, but it certainly can't repair a relationship 
 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 The cover of this book declares that you'll learn "Ten Simple Truths That Lead To an Amazing Life."  If your idea of an amazing life can be distilled to "eat, drink, and be merry," then perhaps you'll see value in the sophomoric platitudes that abound in this book.  Alfred E. Neuman, of Mad Magazine, with his declaration of "What, me? Worry?" provides a pithier statement of the philosophy proposed by Ms. LaRoche.  If you're looking for some deeper meaning to life, to success, to accomplishment, you'd be much better served by reading Napoleon Hill, Anthony Robbins, Dr. Covey, Denis Waitley, or Brian Tracey.  
 I don't even know where to start with this, and I have to admit that despite several attempts, I only made it through 110 pages and couldn't stomach any more. Based on the first 110 pages, one of the main characters, Augusta, is so snide and rude and intolerant of anyone who believes or thinks differently than she does, that she seems more like a 13-year-old brat than an adult woman. The author clearly has issues with religion and makes every religious person in the book a caricature and portrays the people who are basing their lives on the occult as the "wise" ones. And even given that conservative-bashing and Christian-bashing is what all the "popular kids" are doing in our society, I will say that even the author's characterization of Augusta is extreme. This novel just didn't appeal to me at all 
 Guerrilla Warfare: Che Guevara by Ernesto Guevara  Warning this book seems intended to make martyrs  Over the years this book has proved far more useful to mislead potential guerrillas than to educate them.  The handmade weaponry described are ineffective and or failed tools of war. The tactics suggested have led to defeat in the Americas and in Africa. The cause described has never helped the poor and down trodden.  One could readily ponder if the real intent was to make martyrs for the cause of mythical communist paradise. One wonders  how many, aside from the author, died violently because of all the above.          
 I haven't read many books written by Patterson but I liked The Notebook so I thought I would read some of his other publications.  I didn't find much to like about At First Sight.  The story is totally unbelievable and the characters one-dimensional. It is a boiler plate romance novel. The couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart. A wave of a wand and they both know they love each other. The happy couple then find and overcome adversity.   Patterson is not a bad writer. If you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read, you won't be disappointed.  If you want a realistic story and believeable characters, then At First Sight isn't for you 
 Sorry to say I'm not a huge fan of Tanghetto even after seening them play live at La Viruta last month. Few of the tracks are just undanceable and the music gets pretty boring after a while. I say if you want neuvo tango try Narcotango or Otro Aires. 
 I thought the plot was ok and I personally like Mina but I had trouble getting through the book because it is full of typos. Very dissapointing quality, editing wise 
 This book was a load of crap. It was nothing but a bunch of boring common knowledge. They name a subject then give you 1/4 of the info on it. And there was only a couple pics of the bond actors except for Pierce who there was a lot of pics of. I think the author is gay for Pierce. The book was written like someone watched the movies once and wrote down a few facts here and there. I love the bond films but I wouldn't pay a dollar for this book 
 2 1/2 Stars.  There is nothing original in this story about a young man who is a disappointment to his father, has a problem with authority figures, and has yet to find his place in the world.  The plot is predictable from beginning to end and so cliche-ridden it will make your teeth ache.  James Franco has good screen presence and he can act, although he is limited.  Tyrese Gibson on the other hand is totally unbelievable in his role as Franco's antagonist.  He simply always looks like he's acting the entire time.  His character isn't even defined well and his reasons for going after Franco's character lacks sincerity and believability.  The direction and writing is just all over the place in this film that isn't sure what it want to be, so it tries very hard to be everything.  It wants to be a basic training kind of film a la "G.I. Jane" while also trying to be a sports film with its boxing substory.  It wants to introduce us to the world of a first class naval academy while also trying to tell us how naval vessels are built.  It throws in everything else from race relations to father and son psycho-babble.  I was waiting for the kitchen sink to be thrown in for good measure.  The film was okay overall when all was said and done.  I had some fun with it and Franco is fun to watch.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, but it was glaringly not as good as it could have been.  While viewing this film one is liable to keep saying, "if they only did this" or "if they had only done that."  That leaves a bad taste in one's mouth 
 Anytime the Christian Right has a chance to undermine women,it will take that chance and run with it.Please read "The Myth Of Gender" by Fausto- Sterling.Your eyes will be open to new possiblities for your life and family.The whole point of Dobson's book is to controll people so they fall into a limited mindset - male or female,with no room for the individual.The individual is reality not this sexist nonsense.I have always found it more easy to be out in the world and explore.Dobson makes women sound like natural cowards and fools.Very insulting 
 The information on Bond in this book is second to none.  The only problem is the social and political commentary littered throughout the book. The authors are obviously trying to push their world view through a book about James Bond.  In the end it appears the authors would rather have Bond working for the Soviets than for the good guys 
   A trouble some pooch who has reaccuring dreams of being something else, something far greater.... A man. After a series of silly events he begins to take these dreams seriously and goes off on an adventure to find his family and his old life before..... HE DIED.   While the story is very touching and has a very good moral too it it was far too too long for me and seemed kinda cheesy at some pionts they kept on reinfasizing reincarnation, reincarnation, reincarnation. It was interesting but at one piont it became very boring and I lost intrest. I have only been able to sit through it one time, because of this. It jusy seemed like the man was really in a coma and that at one piont that he was gonna wake up from this long boring nightmare but he never did.   A great move to show small children at bed time so they fall asleep and perhaps people with a long patience or perhaps people with  an intrest in animals and dogs would like to see it 
 The camera is decent. The fact that it doesn't come with the correct cable nor software to transfer video to a computer is unacceptable.  What do they expect 90% of consumers are going to do with it 
 I thought that she was going to explain to you how to invest in rental properties without going into deep debt for yourself. However, the truth is you need money to invest in real estate. So, there's really no way around it, which made her book redundant. She just gave examples of 3 people with 3 different investment strategies. In the end, the one with the most number of rental properties ended up with the largest profit growth. I really did not find the book useful for someone looking to invest in rental properties. 
 Pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought; he mistakes child abuse for some form of "real" child rearing.  I just read his interview in the Guardian UK.   Although it has been years since I have read this book, it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when I think about it.  I have read philosophy from classic to contemporary; I have lived in Japan and practiced Zen archery and Zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of Western AND Eastern philosophy yet Pirgsig, to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon. This is proof that Pirsig remains deranged.  Moreover, in the Guardian UK interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered; Pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son's murder. Pirsig is a perfect example of someone with Narcisstic Personality Disorder.  Pirsig's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother.   If you are one of the poor souls who finds something "deep" in this very large pile of verbal manure then I think therapy would be money well spent 
 "My Chain" is the worst song I have heard in a few years ... Go get Nas "Hip Hop Is Dead" instead of this garbage. 
 I put this cover on immediately after I opened my iPod after reading how easy they are to scratch.  I've never had my iPod without the cover on it and have had it 3 weeks.  I now have an iPod covered with distracting scratches on the screen.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  THIS CASE IS JUNK 
 This mat may have a design flow, or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up. Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll. In the process, the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat. I suppose it's still functional, but my brand new mat looks pretty awful 
 Matter of life and death is much better.  Brave new world is lame progressive rock NOT heavy metal.  They don't even do a good job at making progressive rock either.  Check out Therion, Iced Earth, or Dream Theater instead. 
 I bought this phone because i need my hands free as i roam around the building (small church).  I did much research on the web and in consumer reports to find a good portable phone w/out an answering machine for a good price.  Uniden is pretty good but it seems digital tech. in phones just isn't perfected yet...at least for the $30-40 shoppers.  The clarity was ok, some people still told me that i sounded like i was in a closet when speaking to them....but i use an over-the-ear piece so that may be the problem...not the phone.  One thing is clear though, it cut out when i went to our lower floor towards the two ends of the building.  Major static and the phone couldn't connect even after trying the connection again.  My old RadioShack 900 mhz worked fine, so i returned this, went back to Uniden products, bought a 900mhz from them, went downstairs with it, same problem.  Looks like i'll be returning that too.  Oh yeah, don't get a 2.4Ghz phones if you plan on talking while your microwave is going...it will most likely interfere with your 2.4 phone and the phone will only work if your about 50 or more feet from the microwave while it's operating.  I'm back to my 900mhz.  It may feel like a brick but it takes the calls...even outside in the parking lot!  Sorry Uniden. 
 James Patterson created a great character in Alex Cross and I have faithfully followed the series even though the last several have disapponted me.  The plot and character development have become weaker with each book. Yet I kept buying the books, even knowing that Patterson is more of a franchise that an author.   In CROSS Patterson has Alex wonder why his daughter wants to read the same book over and over.  When I read that line I realized that Patterson is making fun of his readers.  That's it for me. I'll not buy another 
 Dalma Heyn tries to make a case for women asserting themselves against patriarchy by having affairs. What she forgets, or ignores, is what these women do TO OTHER WOMEN when they engage in affairs with married men. As a  betrayed wife I know the pain of seeing another woman aid and abet my  husband's deception and betrayal of our marriage.What kind of feminism is  it that takes its power from ruining the lives of women and often children  who have no choice in the matter and often don't know what is going on  until it is all too late? Dalma Heyn sets women against each other,  applauding the women who take what they want and ignoring the plight of the  women who suffer for this. I hated this book, and I'll bet anything my  husband's mistress read it and felt justified by it 
 This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out.  Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky, and the fabric does not appear to breathe.  I'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this.  For cooler weather, I'd prefer something like a good pair of tights (Sugoi for example) 
 It just goes to show that you can have four Ivy League degrees, as Professor Woods says on the dust jacket, and still qualify to compete in Special Olympics.    I was prepared to like this book, but simply could not. Poorly researched, poorly written, and laden with specious conclusions.  The section on Galileo alone was full of enough lies, distortions and omissions of critical information to ruin the book for me.  How he could omit the burning at the stake of Giordano Bruno over his espousing a Copernican solar system?  The inquisitor at Bruno's trial, Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, was later made a saint.  Bellarmine was also the man who later, after examining Galileo's writings, recommended that Copernicanism officially be declared a heresy. Galileo had the Bruno bonfire before him as an example. He knew these people meant business and recanted. Woods says on page 69 the Copernican world view was not an issue until Galileo.  That must be some consolation to Bruno, God bless his charred remains.  Pope John Paul II addressed the issue of Bruno's torture and death a few years ago, it's too bad Professor Woods didn't get the news.  The problem with a book like this is that people without grounding in the history of Western Civilization will read it and not have the background to see the mistakes.     This man was so in love with his thesis, which I am not sure I necessarily disagree with , by the way, that he was blinded to any information that did not fit his purpose.  Very unprofessional.  I can't wait to read his "The Politically Incorrect History of the Soviet Gulags(not as bad as you think)" ,  as long as he is revising human suffering 
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 I have read every novel in the Sharon McCone series and have them all in my collection.  When I found this book at Barnes and Noble and read the description I was giddy with anticipation.  I wanted to read about the relationship between Sharon and Hy as man and wife.  I was very disappointed.  The plot line is basic and good.  A daughter wants to find her mother who disappeared over twenty years ago.  Closure is all she wants although her sister would just as soon let it be.  Thus begins the chase all around the northern California coast, ending in Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Whew!  So little time was spent in San Francisco that the office people who I have come to know and adore, were virtually non-existent.  Most of the conversation is stilted and the majority is done over the telephone.  The cell phone being turned off is a recurring distraction.  Is this supposed to have an allegorical meaning?  I don't know.  Sharon's adopted mother and biological mother rate a paragraph or two in the novel.  Hy appears once or twice and I highly doubt that a newly married man would allow his wife to be so distant from him.  Irregardless of their "evolved" relationship, I think it was cold on Sharon's part to proceed on her own when she has such available talent at the home office, just waiting for such an assignment.    My main complaint about this novel is there are two many one-dimensional characters.  I got so confused as to who was who and how they were relevant to the story.  I never got to "know" them and motivations were sometimes so closeted I was in the dark.  There was a very good potential plot in the Mark Aldin/Ricky relationship and yet it was briefly dealt with in sentences.  His death was related by phone call.  (again, the phone)    Hence the title of my review, the point vanished.  I was bored reading the book and just was not interested nor did I particularly care what happened to Laurel Greenwood.  I don't think she was intelligent enough to do what she did and I do not think she was an artist.  I will read the next book in the series and if it presents the same types of problems for me, I will probably give up reading them as I gave up on VI Warshawski years ago.  When you don't like the main character, no point in reading the novel 
 The book is not well organized even though the organization is very important for such a book with a lot of contents 
 Holly, you are the true jerk. This book is a PC sociology tome masquerading as a historical overview of Halloween. Alexander's okay, Holly; you're not.  
 The religion of peace is at it again!  In response to the popes words, muslims all over the world respond with violence, destruction, rage, hatred, burning down buildings, burning papal effigies, issuing fatwas against the pope, and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back.  Wow, such peace from a religion of "peace".  If Islam is a religion of peace, then all the guns in the world are pink flowers, and every nuclear bomb, a soft feathery pillow.  Violence for words.  Destruction for speech.  PLEASE!  This is a religion of war, and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like Noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age.  This old bag of a man gives Muslims free passes and blames America.    Question:  When will the world start holding to account the actions of Muslims, and stop blaming others, such as Bush, America, the Pope, or God knows who else? How many more innocent people will die at the hand of Muslims before the western world finally, and for the first time, holds the Muslims accountable for their own actions, rather than someone else?      Well Im sick of the left defending this vile cesspool of Islamofacism.  Im tired of the leftist media beating up on Israel and coming to the side of middle-eastern tyrants who shoot 70 year old nuns in the back in response to spoken words.  And then these radical leftists have the audacity blame the pope!  Can you believe it?!!  Yes, idiots all over the western world actually blame the pope for the mindless violence and destruction that followed from a spoken word.  Its unreal!  A grown man got a gun, deliberately aimed it at a 70 year old woman's backside, and deliberately pulled the trigger, purposefully killing her in cold blood....and yet according to socialist America-hating leftists, he couldn't help it.  Its not his fault...its the Pope's fault guys!    Respond to words with violence, and then blame the speaker, absolving the person who actually commits the violence of responsibility.  As absurd as that sounds, I'm sad to say there are actually people all over the world who think that.  And they are idiots (like Noam) 
 Richard is a funny guy. He never can overcome his SCIENTISM and naturalistic reductionism. I wish I could talk to him to help him out (if I were doctor). He needs (1) therapy and (2) to THINK a little more... Dawkins like to use straw-man arguments and does NOT know anything about Christian Theology. I'm truly Sorry for him when he embarases himself with poor representation of something he know nothing about (when talks about religious matters, or even science).  I have also read his article "Science is not a religion" (which is not very good article), and apparently FOR HIM science is a religion...  Usually religious experience involve (a) awareness of the Transcendent and (b) total commitment to It. Dawkins' Transcendant is "THE GREAT SCIENTISM". :D and of course he is commited to it. Not the science, but scientism... Otherwise why would he go around with his naturalistic dogmatism?  
 When this book arrived, it had obviously been handled very poorly during the packaging process. There were smudges and rips all over the cover, detracting from the book's appeal as a coffee table book. I returned it to a local Borders and requested they order a replacement, but I'm still waiting for the new book to come in. This has been very frustratin 
 Dr Laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment.  It is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs. If you dont believe in God and as Dr Laura, you can never be happy is the moral of her story. Laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare, modern child abandonment. She talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical. She moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons' or a year before being married. Actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage'. Is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready?  She would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice. Her rants and raves are actually entertaining, too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets.  I listened to the whole thing(audio book cd) and I couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title. I guess they are there and maybe under chapters 1-10 in the book. I could call out several stupid things but I didnt see 10 that stood out. Lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious.  It is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source. There are other better sources for relationship info. 
  It made my skin very dry and break out because of it. My floormate had the same reaction. We were both very disappointed.  I recommend going for VitaClear which i tried before this product and is less expensive than ProActiv although it is a little more expensive than this.  
 This is an ill-informed fan's one-sided look at the porn industry.  The  author was apparently so in awe of his subjects that he fearfully turned  down the opportunity to be present at the taping of a sex scene between two  porn actors.  In addition,  Mr. O'Toole inexplicably does not include the  details of the porn star Savannah's untimely suicide at the end of her  career.  He refers to her as having "died" after quoting her at  length on her financial success at the height of her career.  This passage  is intended to illustrate that many of the actresses working in adult films  are completely happy doing so. It is inexcusable for him not to mention  that she took her own life after being disfigured in a car accident. Pass  on it 
 Vandana Shiva writes on a worthwhile topic, namely the fact that the dominant economic and legal systems are totally unequipped to deal with environmental reality and have a wildly destructive tendency to impose themselves on the rest of the world. However, this book is sadly too incoherent and poorly written to properly convey the immediacy of this issue. Her arguments are totally lacking in structure and are prone to rediculous, hyperbolic rants about the colonization of the womb and other paranoid fantasies. She cites plenty of sound evidence throughout, but in an equally haphazard fashion. All in all, I guess it is worthwhile to read this book simply because there aren't really any others on the subject, but don't let the fact that Shiva writes like one of those borderline schizo activists turn you off to the importance of the issue of biopiracy 
 Where to start with this bad movie?  As if the plot matters (it doesn't), the movie is about a woman and her sister who use hubbie's computer to access chat rooms, etc, and witness online killings, and of course, see the killer in a sort of "Eyes of Laura Mars" style.  The two lead males are played by non-actor musicians Roger Daltrey and Huey Lewis. Lead females are played by former actresses Natassia Kinsky and Nicolette Sheridan. The killer is played by a still-unknown actor.  Major problems:  1. Talking computers ("electronic chronometer activated"). 2. People talking to computers as they type. 3. Never making a typo even when typing at an awkward angle and not looking at the keys (while talking to someone else). 4. Easy access to talking encrypted computer by using a microphone that you have to be an inch away from to use. And the computer selects only some of the words you say, as needed. 5. Really bad acting. 6. Un-sexy eroticism. 7. Over-technologized thoughout.  It might seem tempting to "save" 5 bucks, but you're wasting the other five dollars. 
 Okay I admit, they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends. Heres my problem, they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera, most of the scenes were blurry, every now and again the focus was clear, I mean c'mon, when I was fourteen I made a short stop motion animation film using an old Bell and Howell super 8 cam and even then I paid attention to the focusing.Okay enough of that, now for the pros of the film. The make-up fx were good and there is one scene that will make most MEN wince, the outdoor and some indoor settings had a NOTLD feel. Overall I recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds, at least you can say you saw it. Rent if you can, if not, buy used 
 An interesting but implausible tale to say the least. The author writes about the existence of stone "platforms" on Cape Breton Island (CBI) that he stumbled across a few years back. Curious, he tries to track down the builders of said platforms with the usual suspects being the French and the English. Going through the existing historical record reveals nothing about who the builders could be.  He then makes the jump to the idea that it must have been Chinese explorers/settlers who did the work during the heyday of Ming China's voyages of discovery. (I suspect that those voyages were more about tribute gathering and trade than about discovery.) Anyone familiar with Menzies' book 1421 will know his theory of how the Chinese sent expeditions circling around the globe yet mysteriously somehow missing Europe(!).  I'm extremely skeptical about Chiasson's theory that it was the Chinese who built the platforms for a couple of reasons. First of all, there is very little reason that I could see as to why anyone would want to build a settlement on Cape Breton Island unless there was something very valuable there. As Chiasson says, there is coal and there is gold. Unfortunately for the theory, China has lots of coal so it would not be economically viable to transport it all the way back to China from CBI and the gold deposits were not enough to sustain later European ventures. Again, China has closer sources of gold at hand and, even if they were to send out fleets of gold miners, there are closer sources along the way to CBI such as South Africa, West Africa, and Central America.  Second, Chiasson's talk of the Chinese using the Gulf Stream to mosey on up the Eastern Seaboard sounds plausible but he also fails to mention that this same current will eventually land you in Ireland and Scotland too!  There are also a couple of other bothersome points I'd like to bring up. First, Breton does not refer to the English but to the region of Brittany in France. And, second, the pictures of the Minority Peoples of China that he uses to posit a possible link between China and the local Micmac (sp) tribe is laughable. It's implausible to suppose that such people would be on board important Han Chinese voyages in sufficient numbers to make a cultural difference in a tribe thousands of miles away!  Like I said, interesting but implausible. I suspect that only actual archaeological digs will dispel the mystery of the platforms, if any 
 First off, I do not agree with Evolution, in any way, shape, or form.  However, I will say that Darwin, unlike most so called "scientists," esp. Evolutionists freely admitted that there was more to learn in the comming years, and that his theories, or hypothesis, might have to be seriously reconsidered if new scientific evidence was discovered that did not corroborate his views.    Most of what I see in scientific debates comes down to pure and simple prideful blustering, and hateful muddslinging!!!  It seems more favorable and a hec of alot easier to smear the opponant than to honestly, critically, and civily debate another person with whom you disagree.  Ego, Ego, Ego, and more Egomaniacal Monkeyshines!!!!!  I am new to this whole debate (Evolution vs. Creation / Intelligent Design), and I have alot to learn on both sides of the issue, but I can tell you this, I am honest, and civil enough to at least make an honest attempt at respecting the other side, as someone, who in my opinion, may be "wrong," but is also a human being deserving of proper respect, esp. if they have devoted years to honest scientific investigation.  All sides need to learn CIVILITY, and PROFESSIONAL RESPECT, WHICH IS SEVERELY LACKING IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TODAY, MORE THAN EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  This is a foundational work which started the whole Evolution landslide. Anyone who truly wishes to debate, refute, or otherwise understand the theory should read it carefully.  Just as one should read carefuly, and critically those foundational works on Creation Science (A real science) and Intelligent Design (A true Scientific Theory).   Be REAL SCIENTISTS AND INVESTIGATE FOR YOURSELVES WHAT YOU BELIEVE, OR DON'T BELIEVE.   I seriously doubt that Civility will ever come to the Scientific Community as a whole, as so few people are truly willing to lay down their Egos to search out truth, especially if the opposite of their own views is terrifying to them.   Yes, there is a God, and he is not you, Dr. Ego Monkeyshines 
 I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.    Don't waste you money on this one.  Get the "Mr. Show" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed.    
 We bought this for my 7yr old son, and in 2 days he had totally destroyed it. Thank goodness we had it on a tile floor. He kicked the bottom and it broke letting out all the water! What a mess. Not worth the money 
 Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story. 
 I started reading this book, skipping the introduction and then realized this isn't the Tao Te Ching at all. This is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said, and so he wrote his own version. It turns out the author admits this in the introduction. I wish I had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk. I guess I should have taken the hint with the "A New Version" doublespeak on the front cover. Sigh. I usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs.      
 I cannot imagine, being Shannon Tweeds and Gene Simmons children and picking up this book one day with the thoughts of maybe getting to know a different more in depth side of your mother. Most Biographies involve birth to the present and everything in between. I knew Shannon Tweed as an 80's movie D-Lister. She was basically in every single sitcom or drama back then as a guest star, or walk on. Her face is sort of recognizable, you might say "I know her from somewhere" but you can't place her.  She is beautiful, she is married to a rock star, and she of course is now in her own reality television show just like everyone else. This book, all 200 pages, lots of pictures, and large type is kind of pathetic. Not in a way that she herself is, but cmon, if you are going to write a "this is my story", spout some details, spill your emotions, give us something besides how you noticed your future husband was very aroused the first time you met him, and how many names you can drop. There are pictures of this woman, taken from playboy, that are full on nude Furry parts and all, I would be mortified if I was her children. There is a time and place for everything; a biography isn't one of them to show your naughty places. Tacky. I read this book, in ½ an hour, and I am not lying. It was that simple. Shannon, your shacking up with Gene Simmons, and your book is basically devoted to your boobs. 
 This watch is a good size, pretty comfortable, and nice looking for a sport watch. But resetting time or date, or figuring out how to turn off the alarm when you set it by mistake (when you were trying to figure out how to reset the time and date) is super frustrating. The buttons are impossible. I've had it with mine and will buy another product 
 If you need a guidebook that will help you plan an itinerary, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! This book, while chock-full of information, gives no practical tips whatsoever about how to arrange activities while touring. I read through it twice and came away with snippets of information but nothing that helped with actually planning how my family would spend each of our four days in the city. The index is incomplete and much of the information is sketchy at best. I would NOT recommend this as a resource, especially for first-time visitors 
 The temperature of the water in one which drowns is as insignificant as the depth of characters and plausibity of this hastily created novel. The biggest mystery one ponders from the bowels of this book; is why was it written, and where on vacation was the Publisher when this novel was approved for publication?  Don Winslow is a brilliant writer, if this were the first book of his that i read, it would be the last.  Fortunately he has accumulated a strong credit side of the ledger with other writings,  this is a heavy debit.........and significant waste 
 This movie made no sense to me whatsoever. it wasn't really funny and it wasn't scary. the only thing that i got was that he killed Zombies or "Returners" as he called theme. and was upssed with one. i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot. but that was the only good thing in the film. it was also boring. but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you 
 I just got and read this book because of some of the more recent and enthusiastic reader reviews. But I beg to differ with their assessment, since this is not the first book on the subject I have read. The author, a journalist, is over her head in this subject matter and apparently does not realize it. This becomes apparent in the context of other neuroscience literature.  Compared to serious works on the subject written by neuroscientists who actually do some of the research upon which their books are based, this is a quick read. I zipped through it in a few hours. By comparison, it takes me days to get through a work of the same length by Drs. LeDoux or Damasio, who are both absolute authorities. The quick overview can of course be most helpful, but be aware that the real scientists are harder to read for a reason. It's because they have very deep subject-matter knowledge coupled with fine sensitivity to what can be claimed without distortion. They know *all* of the pertinent studies on their topic, not just a small subset. They're cautious, and thorough in their explanations. The journalist tends to wish to make sweeping statements on the basis of insufficient knowledge, since she doesn't have years to master such a complex discipline and the summary style is more digestible for a broad audience. I am a scholar-researcher and academic journal editor myself, and have also done quite a bit of newspaper writing, so I know intimately both sides of the writing spectrum. In Ms. Carter's case, after not too many pages I began not to trust her pronouncements. Too many are simply too glib.  Carter treats too many aspects unevenly and incompletely. Music, for instance, gets only about two pages of text, over half of which is devoted to the tingle-thrill sensation, probably because the author found a catchy anecdote in an experiment about chickens and music. It's a cute story for a newspaper, but if you wish to understand music and the brain, this is not even a bare introduction. See instead any publication by Isabelle Peretz, a psychologist-neuroscientist specializing in music at the University of Montreal (she has lots of PDFs on her departmental website), who is very authoritative yet writes accessibly. Carter does not mention Peretz anywhere in the book.  I was surprised when Carter identified the amygdala as the "source of negative emotions of anger, fear and sadness" (p. 103). And she writes: "the amygdala, as we have seen, does not convey concepts, it simply creates emotional feelings." These are misleading formulations that you'd never read in anything written by Antonio Damasio. While it is strongly implicated in the fear reflex, I have not read elsewhere that the amygdala is so clearly involved in sadness or anger. And a neurologist would not say "creates emotional feelings" -- rather, it contributes to a piece of the process of feeling. In his books, Damasio is always careful to point out that any one small area of the brain is rarely completely responsible for anything. Rather, brain functions are typically distributed over networks of brain regions that work together in complex processes and pathways that are still mostly imperfectly understood. Damasio conscientiously presents his entire books as hypotheses in need of further research, whereas the journalist is not nearly so hesitant. The occupational hazard of every journalist is the impossible obligation to get up to speed on a new topic quickly, without any of the formal training that topic experts have, yet present a lucid and balanced explication to a wide readership. In this instance, as happens daily in the newspaper, the summary simplifies the story but often twists the facts and their implications.   On the plus side, the illustrations are numerous, pertinent, and quite helpful in assisting the reader to visualize many of the abstract and difficult concepts in this book. 
 I enjoyed the testimonials from actual business owners, but that's where the enjoyment stopped.   This book was filled with fluff. I had a hard time finding information that was able to be applied to my new business.   The majority of the "great advice" can be summed up in one statement, "Hire a professional."  This was the girls' advice on almost every subject.   Sure, "Write a business plan" is good advice, but I was looking for tips and tricks to make the process easier and more effective for lenders.   Readers looking for details and practical tips will be disappointed.  Might be good to get you thinking about the very beginning stages of planning. 
 "Cookie Mountain" is an all-around mediocre album that, despite obvious passion and earnestness from the band, will age pretty badly. Most songs have little to no vocal imagination, the lyrics are bland, clunky and rhythmically sterile. Like a lot of music nowadays, TVOTR fuse a wide variety of genres, etc., without coming up with any memorable sound of their own. As for the "genuine, anthemic songwriting" the Amazon writer has promised, there is none to be found. Most of the songs drone on without any worthwhile catharsis. That said, "Cookie Mountain" isn't a painful listening experience, it just has no personality--it's safe, it's fashionable, will make most of the "Best Of" lists of 2006 and in one year will be entirely forgotten. 
 I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars.  If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him 
 Actually I intended to order another book "Ramp Plans: Learn How to Build Vert Street Mini Launch and Bowls (2000 Edition)", but by mistake seem to have ordered this one instead without realising it before it arrived.  Must be my mistake where as I should have noticed this in the confirmation email I got. Still, better luck next time.. 
 With so many serious perspectives available on "peak oil", there is no reason to waste time on this screed, which only uses peak oil as a platform to cast aspersions on everything the author hates (and he hates, of course, all that which he does not understand).  He hates: the American south and its culture, Wal-Mart, interstates, strip malls, the Arab nations, and most of all, suburbs and the people who live in them. He loves: Israel, the liberal Northeast as it was fifty years ago, Israel, hateful rants, and Israel.  Peak oil lets him indulge in wishful thinking about how the Arab states will lose their power along with their oil, how the suburbs and Wal-Mart will collapse without cheap motoring, and the greatest reach of all: how the South and West will, for some reason, suffer more than the northern tier states in an energy scarce environment that he is certain is inevitable. Despite the fact that it is the northern tier states that are most dependent on cheap natural gas and heating oil, and have the least access to alternatives: solar, wind, biofuels. This last is thus little more than a transparent rationalization that allows him to imagine the reversal of the loss of economic and political clout of the north due to the inexorable flow of the American population from the dying Rust Belt cities to the more pleasant climes of the suburbs and the south.  Of course, he said all the same things before he ever heard of peak oil; back then he was making the same arguments about how Y2K was going to destroy all those things he despises. As were a lot of the other peak oilers.  Everywhere Kunstler goes, he sees only ugliness. This is to be expected. The ugliness lies within him, so he will never escape it.   Give this one a wide berth and learn something about Austrian economics. You'll be glad you did 
 Such beautiful pictures, and they are great inspiration. Makes you want to spend the day in the kitchen.  There it ends. I tried the white chocolate-candy cane recipe twice.  It just doesn't work.  We (I have a professional kitchen) added flour to make a manageable batter, but after baking could not get them off the baking sheet.  More adjustments, and finally succeeded in making a cookie that no one liked.  We also tried the two layer desert with brownie bottom.  Expensive mess.  The  beautiful photographs are worthy of framing or put the whole book on your coffee table. 
 Let me start off by saying that if you haven't read any of Gerritsen's books featuring her two main characters, don't even consider reading this book. So much about the characters deeply depends on your being familiar with their history. Even if you have read other books with these characters, The Mephisto Club, while starting off with a lot of suspense, is a disappointment. The plot drags and requires you to suspend belief way too much, there are too many subplots that are left dangling, and the ending -- what there is of one -- is weak and unsatisfying. All in all, I'd advise you to skip The Mephisto Club. Your time and money are too valuable to spend on a book that, at best, is mediocre 
 In reading Earth: An Intimate History, I gained much respect for the breadth of Richard Fortey's knowledge and his ability to connect disparate ideas together.  It would be an enjoyable read for someone with a good understanding of plate tectonics who wanted a few interesting case studies to explore.  However, for the general reader who is seeking a better understanding of the mechanisms and effects of plate tectonics, I advise looking elsewhere.  The book meanders, both in its general structure and within each chapter.  Returning to it, I wouldn't know which chapter to look at for particular topics.  Within each chapter, paragraphs on how plate tectonics actually works are interspersed within a travel narrative that I could have done without and bits of geological curiosity that are not really well connected to the general theme of the book.  These problems not only made the book less informative, it made it harder to read -- I never knew what was coming next or whether it would be a valuable contribution to my understanding of plate tectonics.  There are two aids to the reader that would help make this book more informative and readable:  More diagrams (in place of marginally helpful photographs), and more focused prose (with consistent use of topic sentences).  Absent these, I would recommend a pair of books that are much more successful at combining great prose with tons of information:  John McPhee's "Basin and Range" and "Assembling California. 
 Being that my husband is in the film industry, we have seen almost all of the hd dvd and blu ray movies. This one is simply one of the worst if not the worst I've seen. I wanted to see this and was really hoping for it to be great...well it wasn't, even with so many great actors. It was such a terrible plot, and it was ripping off so many other movies it truely made everyone watching it laugh outloud. It was struggling to be good, but it just never was. It could have been with a better script and better directing. The only part that was good was the acting (minus Josh Hartnetts. What a terrible choice with an otherwise good cast!!) Don't waste your time with this one. Also, speaking on the quality of the hd dvd, it was of average quality, not great and not terrible, but still not worth your time 
 Turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after I gave up on it. I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my  neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it. I wondered whether, if I took just a few pages a day, I could eat it and get rid of the evidence. I offered it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. I took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. And then, eventually, voila! The rattling door! What a fine tome T-o-C is. Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic 
 If you love the O'Malley Series, don't even pick this one up.  The depth, and character develpment so wonderfully dispalyed in the O'Malley Series in missing in this book.  It seems the author was rushed, and didn't get a complete story prior to publishing 
 I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic". 
 As it was stated by another reviewer, the Criterion transfer of "Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne" is quite disappointing. The film seems loose in the gate and therefore the picture is very instable; it's jumping a lot, which is very irritating. Also, there is some noise present in the background. So although Criterion did clean up the print quite much, this effort is in vain due to the imperfect transfer. I wonder why nobody has noticed this at Criterion? And its a problem which could have been corrected quite easily....  Considering the high price Criterion asks for this title: don't buy it 
 I can hardly eat this for all of the salt, it leaves you thirsty it's so bad. The ingredients list reads, literally, "100% organic sweet corn, sea salt, and nothing else". They need to make it "100% organic sweet corn and nothing else", and they'd probably have something really great. As it is I'm stuck with 23 1/2 bags of salty corn that I'll have to give away 
 Returns and exchanges are very slow - process has taken a month so far 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 The book was somewhat well-written, and parts were certainly enjoyable, but there is nothing that you can find here that you cannot find in greater detail and with more useful information somewhere else. The case notes were frequently short enough that you would have no real interest in the case, and it read more like a How-To book for someone interested in writing a medico-legal thriller, as long as the person writing that just wanted a lot of really general information without actually knowing enough of what they are talking about. If you really want a good general interest forensics book, check out What The Corpse Revealed by Hugh Miller. In short, the book had a lot of information in it, but none of it was unavailable or more useful here than other sources 
 Some decent stuff, but he barely mentions ETFs, which are becoming a bigger piece of the asset puzzle. And his cavalier negativity of index funds (also mentioned in his prior books) is incorrect.  He needs to read the Arnott study in the Journal of Portfolio Management (26, no. 4, 2000). However, his points on diversification and rebalancing are on target 
 You may ask yourself immediately into The Black Dahlia, why you are watching an intense promotional boxing match, that goes on for several minutes, between two L.A. police officers. What does it possibly have to do with the real-life murder of a young Hollywood hopeful in the 1940's? Well, nothing really. The movie is overloaded with information, the least of which is sometimes the murder of Elizabeth Short, whose mutilated body was found like a decrepit piece of sculptured artwork in Los Angeles in 1947. The filmmakers deny it in the bonus features, but it's film noir, with shadowy lighting, intriguing characters, and haunting jazz trumpet score, and on this level, it's an almost restful and enjoyable film to watch, as characters clearly pay homage to the tough talking guys and alluring exotic femme fatales of '40's film noir. It's central theme, however, something concerning Hollywood decadence, gets muddled in what seems a conventional and complicated police story, and the emergence of plot lines that rival the main story. It's pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey resolution is estranged, and it's multi-storylines collide more than they mesh. Director Brian De Palma's Hitchcockian style works well in seperate entities as opposed to the entirety of the film, and the cast, for the most part, are forever inviting you farther into the film with evolving characterizations, even when you can't possibly take on another police bulletin of worthless information. I was never bored for a moment, the film is that sensually stylized, but it is finally grossly unsatisfying, like a Playboy magazine without a centerfold, or indeed, an unsolved murder. 
 I was very disappointed to find that most of chapter 5 "Genetic Engineering" was incomplete. The chapter was cut off (on page 80) and was followed by a repetition of page 49-80. Chapter 6 "Why we should Worry" had been left out and the beginning of chapter 7 "Human Rights" (page 105-113) was missing as well. It was very important for me to work on precisely these (missing) chapters at exactly this moment in time, so I am of course quite dissatisfied with the quality of this particular product.  
 The production of the play was terrible.  The acting was even worse.  I was going to show it to my students, but I can't show them that performance.  It was pathetic.  Also, there is no closed captioning.  If you were thinking about getting this version, I highly recommend that you think again 
 I was a bit disapponted with many of the recipes in this book either because they seriously lacked flavor or just didn't turn out right.  Also, I agree with the title in the sense that the dishes described in it are healthy, but quite a few are far from being simple (or, conversely, they are so simple that they're boring).  On the bright side, I did enjoy many of his dessert recipes, particularly his fruit-based ones.  Also, Pepin's example menus are quite creative and helpful, provided that you can do something to dress up the flavor of the actual meals.  There is no question in my mind that Jacques Pepin is perhaps one of the most talented and respected chefs of our time, but this particular book just seems to fall short 
 Any band that releases an album with a song titled "Rock You Tonight" should be banned from ever recording ever again.  I wish that rule would have been in place during Firehouse's hayday.  Thank goodness people were sick of this stale brand of Rock and quickly switch to more substantial listening choices.  
 I read the first chapter of this book in the bookstore before buying it and thought it got off to a great start. But I soon found it went downhill from there. Jade is a likeable character, but Lucien is the same vampire I swear I've encountered in other author's books -- "Shades of Gray" by Amanda Ashley comes to mind (are they the same person??) and I can't recommend that one, either -- and he's just as one-dimensional. There are too many background throwaway characters and too much downtime. Whichever New York editors came up with the rule of assigning page counts to each sub-genre of romance should be taken outside and flogged. The places where the author padded the story to fulfill the page quota are painfully obvious -- such as when Jade has a party at her apartment and there is an introduction for EACH and EVERY person who comes to the door -- it goes on for pages! We get WAY too information about people we will in some cases never even see again. The one who sticks in my mind is the guy who went to medical school in Florida. I kept waiting for there to be SOME significance to this, but -- nope -- never mentioned again. There are also too many sentence fragments. I almost feel bad giving this book such a low rating -- the author can obviously write when she puts her mind to it -- but this book just fell flat. There are other authors of vampire romance out there I would heartily recommend over this book. 
 I have a Mac. I need an external hard drive where I can just drag my files on to the hard drive's icon, eject the icon, and be on my merry way.  This hard drive seems unable to do that, or, if it is, the help section is painfully bare.  Even if you're looking for a hard drive where you can set it up to automatically back up certain files with the touch of a button, I wouldn't recommend this hard drive to Mac users. I happen to dislike the way PCs are set up; I find the organization very anti-intutive, and that's a big part of my issue with this hard drive.  On my way out the door to return it right no 
 This book is only a shadow of what Bukowski can do. I was very dissapointed with his wife being so hell bent on releasing his unpublished work. These poems are all ones that he would have never released had he  been alive. They have no charm and show nothing of his talent. His wife I  guess thought they were good enough to be released. I beg to differ. If you  want a good collection of his poems from the last years of his life check  out Betting on the muse which is an amazing book 
 This is the first and only Denis Johnson book I've read, and it wasn't a good one. I'd heard such great things about the author that I was very very excited to start reading this book. I was more than let down by this book. I didn't even finish reading Angels, and that's rare for me. Don't get me wrong, the man's a talented writer, but a horrible storyteller, and if you don't have both you're worthless to me. I've been told that Denis Johnson's short stories and poems are better than his novels, so I plan on checking out Jesus' Son. If you want to learn how to write reading Denis Johnson would probably be helpful, but if you want to say something ignore this book. Read Ask the Dust by John Fante for great writing, and great storytelling 
 This is a great address book, but you should know that the price coming out of the factory is $9.95, not the higher prices cited in this listing 
 The title of this book should actually be "Speech making by Ronald Reagan" because only about 1/4 of the book deals with the battle for Pointe du Hoc. Most of the book champions the speechmaking ability of the former president. The battle description that it does have is pretty dry and lifeless. 
 I found this book insulting at times.  It is a poorly veiled attempt to get people to fork over the thousands of dollars for their mentorship program.  A lot of sections are told from the narrative of some "newbies" to the program and how the support they received from the conference calls get them going.  Almost nothing of substance on anything that the title suggests would be covered.  Dont waste your time on this one.  You will nothing new that you did not pick up from their first book "Buying Homes in Nice Areas", which I would recommend 
 I ended up returning this item as it didn't fit my needs.  I felt I could find the information in a basic corporate finance book or other books that I own and many of the question can be found in other less expensive books or on the internet. 
 I was very disappointed to find that the version of Penthouse and Pavement on this collection is the 4:04 edited single version with a horrible edit of the intro.  The original version is something like 6:00, so there's nearly two minutes missing from the song.  Otherwise, most of the must-have Heaven 17 songs are here, but all the shortest versions 
 First off, I'm not a zakk wylde fan, but my friend got the dvd so I gave it a try. I've always thought he's overated, but damn this dvd shows he pretty much just sucks. Let's see: can't sing, can't write a decent song, plays Tony Iommi riffs sped up for his "godlike" solos, and on top of that plays like a sloppy drunk for this show. Lets go into detail.  Singing: imagine lemmy kilmeister with a really bad cold and after he just smoked a couple packs of cigaretes and you have Zakk's singing down pat. Songs: It's funny he makes fun of Limp bizkit so much since he's songs are nearly as retarded as Limp bizkit songs. Slow, forgetable, and boring are the best way to describe these songs. It sounds like Zakks going for the whole pantara slow groove song but they just sound like slow muddy crap. Solos: Oh wow! he plays pentatonic solos  like pretty much every other rock guitarist of the past 30 years, but this time there really fast! Not faster then just about any decent thrash guitarist out there, but hey he has a cool beard 
 I saw the "Young" part.  I even saw the "Black" part.  But "Gifted"?  My God!  This was such a waste of time in my busy life.  I can't believe I was subjected to read such boring nonsense.  If you're thinking of reading this book, DO NOT.  You would have more fun  being dead 
 Book is very basic and the CD was not shipped with the book.  All the same books here localy have a practice CD included with the book.  So make sure you get what is offered.  Cheers Ji 
 These bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom.  The fold-down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff.  I lost three bags of milk due to leaks.  If you have to transport the bags anywhere, like back and forth to work like I do, I would avoid these bags.  They just leaked all over the place for me, even after I carefully re-sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions.  I would recommend the Lanisoh bags over these.  
 Most Canon photo paper is very high quality.  I print to the photo paper (glossy) and photo paper plus all the time and am very happy with the results.  So I was surprised that this paper is so dull.  It is hard to tell which side is the printable side and the printouts are 2-dimensional and not very bright 
 All the episodes are hacked to bits.  It's not worth the money.  I hope they release Season 1 episodes uncut.  It seems that many, like me were very disappointed with the release 
 I love Pete Hamill and was looking forward to reading another of his stories about New York at Christmas time.  This was a major disappointment 
 I really was looking forward to something that explored the emotional whirlwind that I have been going through.  This was certainly not it.  It touches on what I wanted and then veers off into mythologically-based new age nonsense (and I have nothing against new age stuff in general).  If you are looking for a treatment of what weddings and marriage mean in the modern world, I recommend Kamy Wicoff's I Do But I Don't.  I also hear that A Walk Down the Aisle is good.  I'm ordering it now, and we'll see 
 Okay...look at the cover...it should tell you one thing...take your time...as obvious as can be.  Corey, you do not have to turn your back on American Idol, we have turned our back on you.  Do not waste your money on this piece of trash.  It would be better to light a match to your money.  Weak attempt at fame and Corey's 15 minutes ran out years ago.  Did he ever really have 15 minutes 
 The best cuts on this album--Let it Snow!, Away in a Manger, and The Christmas Song--aren't nearly enough to reccommend it.  The so-called "pop" tunes marginalize the spirit of the holiday, and they're kind of stupid to boot.  "Reindeer Boogie" is an embarrassment.  Trisha has a great voice and is one of the great interpretive vocalists in any format.  This album came out several years before Martina McBride's evergreen collection and could have been moved by the same spirit that informed that holiday classic 
 i have not read this book...i would look at it if someone tossed it to me, but i will not go out of my way to look at it, nor would i purchase it...for the simple reason that the author, mr. barkun, appeared on c-span, and engaged in a tag-team attack on one of the subjects of his screed, alex jones, along with the host, brian lamb...ANDDDD more importantly, he refused to appear on Jones' show when Jones invited him to discuss what he'd written, and what he'd said...and he apparently did not even interview jones for his book, which is inexcusable negligence from someone who purports to be a scholar - or from any author for that matter.. 
 Some of the absolute worst, most pretentious, emptiest, and most ultimately worthless drivel I have ever read. Jorge Luis Borges, regardless of all the idolatry that's been heaped upon him, had a surprising number of misses, and maybe nothing much to say. But I'll grant that he had a few high spots. Not this guy. Very derivative and disappointing stuff...I'll go elsewhere for literary thrills 
   Let me start right off by saying that I love what Blackmore's Night is all about. They've made some of the coolest music I've heard in a long time. This current band lineup is excellent. What troubles me is that the material on this outing pales when compared to past efforts. A better title for the project would be "After the Magic Has Gone". While the CD is technically sound in musicianship and production, it appears that the creative well of Ritchie's songwriting is drying up and he's merely going thru the motions. Hey, it happens to even the best of them. If this is the case then it's been a great 10 year run. Just don't leave us with elevator music!!!  The warning signs of writer's block are all there....in the past 4 years we've gotten a compilation CD, a DVD, an Xmas CD and a sub-par studio release. What's next, another live album?   I must say that I will never likely be a fan of Candy's lyric writing. Only one word can describe it. Bad. Just plain bad. One only needs to listen to "Old Mill Inn" and cringe. Ouch! How contrived. I get doosh-chills every time I hear it.    The first thing a writer learns is to go out and "live the life" and then write about what you know. Than at some point in time, one hopefully makes the effort to perfect their craft. Nope. Not here. Sophomoric shlock. It's gone on now for too long. Candy, borrow 15 bucks from Ritchie and go out and buy "The Craft of Lyric Writing" by Sheila Davis. Next to marrying a millionaire rock star it'll be the best move you ever make.     I just pray it ain't too late. 
 I rented this film immediatley after seeing the first Bride with White Hair hoping for a fluid and entrancing continuation of the story.  There was a perfect setup for a sequel and I couldn't wait to watch it unfold.  After the first half an hour I knew that director Ronnie Yu had abandoned the feel of the first film and it seemed he didn't really give a damn about how interesting the story was.  Poor dialogue, inadequate story, there was nothing satisfying or even interesting in this film.  If you enjoyed the first BWWH you'll probably still be tempted to watch this movie just make sure you rent it before buying 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 Funny enough, I am Shine's target audience... a stay-at-home mom who believes my children come first, agrees that cultivating a healthy relationship with my husband is important, buys organic, does my best to take care of myself etc.  I thought I would love this book.  I WANTED to love this book.  I believe we should champion SAHPs more and I was thrilled to find a book that seemed to do just that.  But as I was reading I was stunned to find that while I agreed in principle with nearly everything Shine said, I couldn't get past her highly judgemental, snotty way of referring to those different than herself.   She chides the women's rights movement for not being more supportive of SAHMs (agreed) and declares she wishes we could all be sisters and supportive of one another.  Yet she is highly critical of these "sisters" whose choices differ from her own. My jaw dropped when she referred to an overweight woman in the grocery store a "fat a#$."  I don't remember ever calling my own sister a fat a#$!  Shine is not the voice of stay-at-home-moms I was looking for. 
 Cute dog. Obnoxius owners.  OK I am one of the few that did not enjoy the book let alone finish it. My hopes were to pass it on to mother-in-law, nephew, wife.  I did not care for, let alone expect,a description of the couples sex habits & birth control strategy. Mix that in with a smattering of needless cursing and no one gets this book, it is heading back to the used book store where I got it. 
 This review is for the MP3 audio cd.  Unless I received a faulty cd, this audio book was generated by an automated translation program. It's fraud. You don't pay to listen to a computer voice. I can't comment on the book 'Acres of Diamonds', which I was anxious to read/listen to, as this cd was so pathetic. [...]  
 Buy low and sell high. Keep stock for years and diversify your portfolio. Now you've already read the boo 
 First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.  Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now 
 I had respect for Prof. Wheeler, and so this book came as a tremendous disappointment. It does little but trot out all the latest fringe 'theories' about a woman who has already been the subject of numerous myths  and dubious theories already 
 I did not like the book Adam of the road because it tells you a whole bunch of stuff about the characters before it gets to the story and by the time you get to the story you forget about the characters. I also did not like the fact that the book talks weird and it says like thou father I shall bla bla bla 
 The woman who helped engineer the useless war against the Christians in the Balkans (to help Klinton distract us fro Monicagate), promoted our sales of technology to the Korean Dictator so he could threaten the world with his nukes, is now in a panic to justify her actions which so harmed America. I cannot read the reviews which praise her without wondering how she could be so misunderstood/identified.  She is a disgrace 
 I purchased and read this book based on its glowing reviews and my affinity for Mr. Stackpole's BattleTech books, which I enjoyed many years ago, and was very disappointed. I found myself reading over (skimming) much of the book in an ever accelerating rate to obtain the basic gist of the story and the plot resolution.  While the protagonist Neal, is a great character, I found that the heroine, antagonist wizard and other characters were shallow and predictable.  The plot is thin and revolves around magical items that must be recovered to break a feud between two families vying for the economic control of a small realm of the larger world in which the story takes place. This plot seemed reminiscent of a video game.  Another plot involves the forbidden romance between Neal and an Elf, which is more interesting than the main plot, but overall not enough to hold my interest.  While these plots could have been compelling, I felt uninvolved and unconcerned in the story's development and resolution.  In regard to the nooks and crannies of history and arcane technologies that attempt to create a believable world, I found them uninteresting and typical for this genrea.  Fantasy has the potential to take the reader on an escapist journey; this book did not accomplish that end at for me.  I would not recommend buying this out-of-print book. 
 Basically this book is an elaborate defense of promiscuity and hedonism.  I have liked his other books in the past (Skinny Legs and All is one of my all-time favorites) but this one didn't have enough insight to adequately place the elements of the story within a greater understanding of the world around us (usually one the greatest things about his writing. 
 I just got this figure in the mail and I have to say that it is really nice looking. I have it up on my mantle now and it looks a=even better out of it's packaging. It is a must have for Kings, Gretzky, and NHL fans. Id rate the pose a 10 out of 10, it was from when he got the points record in Edmonton. This figure would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the assembly. You have to put Wayne's legs on and normally the leg assembly is easy but thios was just horrific. It is possible, but I had to use tons of soap and water just to get the legs in, and then it wasn't easy. But I think that it is definately worth it. 
 This doesn't work. First time I tried it, it seemed as if my eye liner smudged more. So I tried it again...and again...and again....I've given up on it. It totally doesn't work 
 it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 I found this book to be disgusting, and lacking any redeeming qualities or messages.  I agree with the reader who stated the language is shocking, only for other reasons entirely.  If you don't like trash, you won't like this book 
 Not his best book,I Thought Waldo Lost in New York is more authoritive. I mean who honestly belives that someone who is always lost can be trusted to help other people become self reliant, when he can't even rely on himself 
 If I am not mistaken,this is Jonathan Kellerman's third book involving a suspect religious cult.  It gets a little tiresome.  The plot was not as suspenseful as his books usually are.  But it is easy reading, and the writing is entertaining enough to read if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan 
 Maybe I should read the description better, but I was disapointed to find out, when receiving it, that this is JUST a USB Key with a pen and anemic led light.  No "swiss army stuff". Not even a knife. I thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have, you know, a knife?   That said, the USB key is very tiny, almost too small on its own (detached from the swiss army non-knife housing), so it's good it has a "home" within the casing, otherwise it would probably go missing 
 I'm no prude, but some of the actions described in this book go beyond crude to disgusting and repulsive.  Who needs to waste time reading about such behavior?  Don't we see enough of the depths of human depravity on the news? I would have expected a huge protest from families of middle class black people, who are portayed with every variety of perversion and obsession...the only ones who are shown as decent human beings are strange in their own ways, nonformist to the extreme. 
 Katzenbach demonstrates ameture descriptive ability combined w/ a poor plot.   I put it down 5 times before page 40.  "Wrong Man" left my gut wrenching w/ memories of the $25 I paid for it.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! 
 Full of hatred as the first one, just the sources of this last one tell us everything about how the writer of that biography has written it : using tabloids and people magazines.... That's all, so no doubt about the poor accuracy of the content. Better buy other books on Mr Gibson 
 I really love Cat Stevens' early work such as Tea for the Tillerman and Catch Bull at Four.  When I found a Mona Bone Jackson LP in a yard sale I thought I was in for a real treat.  However when I listened to it for the first time I thought it was so bad that I immediately threw it into the garbage 
 This is an inspiring story about one of the TRUE heroes of the United States, honored (much too late) both at home and abroad.  That being said, Bantam Books should be ASHAMED of the absolutely SHODDY, INFERIOR quality of this paperback edition!  When I opened my NEW copy, the first page in the photograph section fell out, which led me to look more closely at that section.  The pictures are so poorly reproduced that many, if not most, of them are barely recognizable as photographs!  Bantam Books has given this Great American Hero, Mr. Vernon J. Baker, the same disgraceful treatment that the U.S. Army gave him for so many years.  Reprehensible and unconscionable 
 This book wasn't what I expected. It is small (4x6 maybe) and doesn't contain anything I didn't already know. A better book is "Great Braids" by Thomas Hardy, also available on Amazon 
 How can Stephen Mitchell even think of such an abberation - editing Walt Whitman's greatest poem? Sure, there are several versions of the Song of Myself, but if you want to read Whitman, read the original. The first version is the most powerful, and Whitman toned it down over the years, turning it into "poetry" rather than his initial burst of enthusiasm. There are several editions of the poem that will let you get the true texts: for example, the Library of America's complete Whitman has both the first version of Leaves of Grass and the "deathbed" version, which Whitman revised shortly before his death. There are other versions throughout Whitman's career, as he added poems to the Leaves, and tinkered with existing poems. But this book is a sham. Avoid it 
 This CD is a total misrepresentation.  MANY of the songs are VERY poorly done concert versions of songs.  They even use the exact same audience cheering track on several songs.  Buy it only if you are a fan looking to fill in missing songs in your collection.  Don't buy it thinking you are getting all the original hits.  14 songs are live.  One appears to be re-recorded.  The rest are the originals.  Also, on CD #2 many of the media tags are incorrect.  When you play "All I Really Need Is You" (Live) the title "Heartbreak Hotel" shows.  When you play "Headed for the Future" the song title "All I Really Need Is You" shows.  When you play "Heartbreak Hotel" the song title "Headed for the Future" shows.  Overall, a VERY sloppy project they obviously just rushed to market not caring about quality 
 I'll admit it, the title got me. I probably read two business books a year, and this one didn't offer anything new. Most of it was new twists on the same old rules. It was not inspiring, motivating, or compelling 
 I recently went to a cherokee reservation to a casino there, and saw no "genocide" going on.  Some years back, I bought cigarettes at a seminole reservation and they were really cheap, because the indians didn't have to pay taxes.  I didn't notice mounds of dead bodies or see any crematoriums emitting nerve gases.  Yet, these same voices screaming "genocide" are generally the same ones screaming "no WMDs in Iraq", all the while ignoring the masses of gassed Kurds.  Go figure 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 My aim was to buy a PSAT prep book that would prepare for the test.  I, knowing very little about the reputations of various SAT prep companies, ended up purchasing this book because it was the cheapest on the rack at Borders.  I was, however, immensely disappointed on the quality of instruction it offered.  The first sample test was utterly glutted with errors and mistakes.  I also heard later that the questions weren't even real PSAT questions.  Personally, I plan on contacting Barron's so I can receive a full refund 
 No wonder I loathe the majority of rap and hip-hop. It's because of no talent *ssclowns like D4L trying too hard to make music, but coming up with lyrics stolen from quality rap artists like Eazy-E and Dr. Dre and dumbing them down with something that a 12-year-old trendy would come up with.   I suggest that you DON'T buy this. Go for these if you want quality rap/hip-hop:  "Enter The Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers" by Wu-Tang Clan "Straight Outta Compton" by N.W.A. "Eazy-Duz It" by Eazy-E "The Chronic" by Dr. Dre "It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back" by Public Enemy  And this is speaking from a person who prefers technical death metal and grindcore over anything these days 
 Riedel's water glass and gourmet glass are both made in France of glass (not crystal).  The stem's too short for wine in my opinion, but you could always use them for water.  The water glasses are more suitable, though, as they have a wider mouth 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I bought this gift for my daughter for Christmas.  It does not work at all. It sounds like a cheap transistor radio when you attempt to adjust the knobs.  I'd like my money back 
 After reading an overview regarding the plot of this book, I decided to give Ed McBain's latest novel a whirl.  After 20 minutes into the book, I had the mystery figured out.  Okay, I was a little off on one of the characters (I surmised it was a girl in the Caribbean and actually it was a black girl who worked at the local ice cream depot, but still...).  I read the entire book in one day and while enjoyable, it is predictable even to the politically correct Bush bashing (bad economy and he stole the election from Gore, dag-nabbit) which has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot.  If you want a mindless, easy-to-put-down and finish quickly book, "Alice in Jeopardy" is for you.  If you want a novel full of surprises and twists, amazing characters and an author who leaves his personal politics out of the story, pick up a Harlan Coben novel 
 Not one of my favorite books...  It was not related to science in a meaningful way 
 I was expecting this to be a fantastic book after reading some of these reviews.  I found this book to be a real struggle to get through.  It started off quite well but soon became quite boring. There were still so many unresolved issues in Faith's life by the end of the book that it really left you hanging. It shocked me when she revealed that she had not told anyone about the Homecoming incident. I just don't think that is realistic after what she went through. I would not recommend this book 
 Man, oh man, I think this is one of the worst books I've ever read.  If I could give The Thanatos Syndrome negative stars, I would!  Seriously, half way through, I came to Amazon to see how bad other people thought it was.  Boy was I shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive!  I found the book bizarre, unfocused and poorly written.  The volcabulary repeatedly seems misused.  The plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that US funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation.  The physics, engineering, psychology, medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic.  Characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome, only to have them dissipate.  And so on.  The characters don't even seem like real people.  For example, the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain, and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are.  How could someone know a person that well, but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood?  Or:  one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them.  C'mon, if the guys a nut (and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking 'duck' to them is nuts!), write him as a nut the whole way through, don't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book's climax!  The book's title isn't even explained, for crying out loud.  Thanatos means death in Greek, I believe, but I could never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was dying.  I won't read this one again, nor will I look for anything else by Percy Walker.  
 I can't believe how many people think this movie is a masterpiece. I had such high expectations of it and was extremely disappointed. When the film began I was interested for about 20 minutes, but then as it went on I started to have doubts. After a while I was debating whether or not to turn it off, but towards the end I decided to leave it on just to see how bad it was actually going to get. And it really did get bad! The ending was so predictible and hackneyed. It was just another crappy cops and robbers story, but with a high budget and an all-star cast 
 I heard so many fabulous and positive things about this series that I bought two for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas.  BIG mistake.  This book was NOT the uplifting, spiritual guide that I was led to believe.  I had hoped that it would help solidify the values that my husband and I have taught her.  The book traumatized and frightened her so much that she was having stomach and headaches and couldn't sleep at night.  I couldn't get these two books out of my house fast enough 
 Once thought of as a women's health magazine, Cosmo has taken a twisted turn into pointless redundancy. At one point, Cosmo seemed to be a must-have, along with water and oxygen.  More and more lately, it seems that the magazine is posing the question "how can we survive on ONLY water and oxygen, and still be sexy while we do?" Ocassionally, a featured article faces the issues of things ranging from eating disorders to politics, but few and far between.  They don't seem to realize that on the other side of the page for the eating disorder article, is a woman who wears a size 0 and is still unsatisfied with herself, thinking that she must conform to some "heroin-chic" fad.  Fun Fearless Female - articles about real women who make a real difference - is great. It shines the spotlight on someone who not only is beautiful and successful, but has enough education and talent to succeed in the world, without needing a man. If the magazine featured more of these things, maybe it would be worth my subscription fee.  But tell me when the last time is that you saw a cover NOT featuring the phrases "mind-blowing sex", "how to satisfy (insert breathing life form here)", or "barely-there", which seems to refer to not just underwear anymore, but EVERYTHING.  This isn't a magazine about women's health anymore. It's all about how to keep your man happy, while still conforming to social standards in fashion, weight, and financial standings. I'm sorry, but the "girl on a budget" can't afford a $430 skirt, or uncomfortable shoes with the uncomfortable price of $300+.  Cater more to the real woman; not the one who only cares about her relationship status, pant size, and bank account 
 This is nothing compared to their EP, which was great by the way. Songs lack of inventive, arrangements and feeling... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued, but no more 
 The premise of the universe being nothing more than a giant computer is sexy and the author apparently has been very successful in milking every bit of it to advance his career and make some money selling books on the side. Sadly, the whole thesis is a tautology. It adds no real insight. It predicts nothing. It can neither be proven nor disproved. In short, it is just like String Theory. But considering that there are only a handful of quantum computer cosmologists while string theorists number in the tens of thousands, it is not a serious offense 
 I'm an (unemployed) agronomist, here in Brazil.I tried to read this bad book, available free on internet.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it. All bad things who are possible to exist in a book, this book has.This book is racist.This book, tries to cover this, but this book is so or more racist, then a KKK's book.If you try to read it, you will ever see that the "menaces" are EVER non arians:africans, asiatics, etc.This book claims that "Africa is overpopulated".In fact any african countries has even the half, of the population per square mile, as Belgium to exemple. This book has hundreds of bogus and false theories. This book has a lot of doomed and false prophecies, about future.All of then, a complete failure.To exemple, this book "predicts" that "hundreds of millions" of peoples will be exterminated by famine between 1970 and 1980.A fraud. (...)In fact, eugenics = neomalthusianism = ecology.In fact eugenics, neo-malthusianism, marxism (leninism, stalinism, hitlerism, fascism, maoism, etc.) , are all godless religions. The only good thing in Paul R. Ehrlich, is that he was born in USA.(... 
 It sucks big time!!!!!!! Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was "Today", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was "Disarm" which I hated from day one, and the same with "Cherub Rock". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is "Mayonaise" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's 
 If you think this will help you with using Exchange for web applications, think again. The first chapter that mentions the web is Chapter 12 on page 533. All the examples up til then are in VB. On the positive side the book gives a fairly detailed theoretical background to the Exchange 2000 development environment, but it still leaves me looking for a book on Exchange 2k web development 
 I had to quit reading after the third page. This woman thinks she's humorous, but it's at we clutters' expense. The put-downs just keep coming and coming, which is NOT the way to build a rapport with the reader who is  searching for advice. I give her 1 star for trying 
 You have to use the Speck USB cap if you use this skin, and it introduces noise to my iPod Shuffle, which I hate very much. It's good protection but you've got to give up some audio quality for it... 
 I recently purchased this book and was charge $65.00 total.  It was not worth nearly that much money.  I am very dissatisfied.  I will never purchase from this seller again 
 I'm a hardcore B.G. fan.  I'll copp anything from lil whoadie. Is this first cd of B.G. you are consdering buying?   STOP!!!  Go back to the previous cds...get "Checkmate" for your first B.G. purchase.  Then purchase backwards until u buy "True Story".  THEN get "Heart of the Streets".   Too many of the beats here suck.  Its just pitiful...maybe people in the N.O. like that BS.    At last B.G. is workin with Mannie fresh again...i'm waitin on that "It's All on U Vol.3 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 Some good pieces here, but several which are not good.  I am a fan of the composer, but I would recomend his other works to see him at his very best.  I was disappointed by this one 
 This book does not contain the gifts of the Catholic faith, but instead is a new age spiritual treatise of total, unqualified tolerance. What comes to mind is the old phrase "if it feels good, do it".This is exactly  what is wrong with society. Too much of doing one's "own thing".  Nothing about obedience and belief in what will strenghten us through mid  life is contained in the book. Do not read this book if you are looking for  the answer to your mid life crisis.One thing about reaching fifty is that  you can cut through the mustard and see a hidden agenda under a guise of  honesty.This book will not lead one to their home, but farther away into  confusion 
 I bought my X5 in early October of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems. In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company. When you read all the things the X5 can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great MP3 Player but it rarely works 
 Well....      I'm not happy with :(   The DVD's are cool indeed but the so cald H3D Viewing system   i don't like, why ?!   Sure i can see depth, sure i can see 3D with it,   But, NOT like in the pictures on the H3D Viewing System Box, nothing comes out of my TV or the so cald  come-off-the-screen effect, that's for sure...   And it's NOT that i plugged it wrong ! Or... i have bad eyes : 
 My 5 year old bought this toy with his birthday money.  The figures are great and the weapon and dragon are awesome, however, the ship will not stay together.  Every time my son plays with it, we have to rebuild it, making it not so much fun for any of us.  It probably is fine for an older child who can fix the ship on their own, but if you have a younger child you may want to pass on this one 
 If my eleventh grade son had written this book, I would have given it a D-.  When Rashid Khalidi write it, it gets a triple F.  The logic is not there, the facts are wrong.  Can't Palestinians do more than hate Israelis? 
 After a fairly good first outing with "Dark Harbor", Mr. Hosp fails with this book on every level.  The characters are cardboard cutouts, the dialog is wooden and predictable, the plot is paper thin.  In other words, everything about the book is a cliche, much like this last sentence.  Get the picture?  Others have gone into the story line, so I won't bother but suffice it to say I truly felt gyped out of the cover price of this book.  The only reason I finished it was because I kept thinking that surely it would get better.  Fooled again 
 The flow of writing in this book is dreadful.   I honestly don't understand how this was published.  I've read 40 pages into it and the book is mostly narrative dialogue.. but in the few instances where it's descriptive.. the writing style doesn't change.  No attempt is made at transitioning from event to event and it's very unrealistic at best.  It doesn't seem like a normal conversation with normal associated emotions.  Flat and unappealing.  I do not recommend this book whatsoever.  
 Abridgements of great works in and of themselves are not a bad thing.  As I read through this volume I could not but help noticing how poorly it reflected upon Freeman's original three volume work.    Douglas Southall Freeman's Magnum Opus is distorted quite significantly in this abridgement.  If you have not read his original work I suppose this volume will suffice.  But why settle?  I frequently come across the original volumes at used bookstores for around $50-$60.    Mr. Freeman's writing is good literature apart from being great history.  Though the original work is dated it still is a magnificient example of historical writing.  Mr. Freeman's work is what got me interested in Civil War history.     
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 This book was quite boring. Within the first few pages (when Ruby describes her own birth) hints were dropped about the ultimate "big secret" of the book. By the time I'd read a quarter of the book, there were so many hints it wasn't a secret any more. By the time I got to the end, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything more to the story than that. None of the characters were particularly likeable, nor were they bad enough to hate.  The book was billed as "darkly funny and satirical" in one review. I saw no humor except for the brief slapstick physical mishaps at a wedding reception late in the book. On reflection, I gained nothing from reading this book, and got about a half-minute of laughter from that one scene. It truly was a waste of my limited reading time 
 I seem to recall that the author of this "book" did a documentary that aired on PBS some years ago, which was not too bad. Not being able to find a video of the documentary, I looked forward to the 2nd edtion of the book. What a waste! Whoever indexed this thing must have been drunk at the time! Look up any entry in the index and almost none of the references are correct! e.g. "Swift, Wesley" refers you to pages 14, 15: but there's no mention of him on those two pages; "Rockwell, George Lincoln" refers you to page 21: no mention of Rockwell on that page, but there is a mention of Tom Metzger, whose listing in the index shows no reference to page 21!!! Beyond this, the book was written from the viewpoint of someone with the mindset of Hillary Clinton: not a very inviting alternative to individuals portrayed in the book 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 This is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child.  There are only two working buttons, one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker.  There is some padding on the top, but not enough.  The manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added.  Overall not a good value at all for the price.  
 If your goal is to beat a child into submission, to break them and make them hate you this is the book for you.  It is a manual on how to abuse a child from a vocal proponent of torturing children 
 This game is for people to play if they're drunk or mindless...or in some cases both....it's completely pointless and uninteresting...if ur just going to play bunco to see if u can get 21 snake eyes you either love to waste time or are just stupid...sorry but i mean think about it?...why PAY MONEY for this when i can JUST USE DICE from OTHER MORE INTERESTING board games I already own? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! ~*Even if you manage to make the game interesting by being creative and thinking a little...you still shouldn't buy it...b/c like i said before JUST USE DICE FROM OTHER BOARD GAMES YOU ALREADY OWN! 
 I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work 
 I love the Saitek 880 wired gamepad.  So I figured the wireless would be that much better.  Unfortunately, my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems.  There's nothing worse than the few times I really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out.  I bought this and the batteries died.  I sent Saitek an e-mail and they sent me two new ones.  Great, they worked!  Then they died soon after.  Hopefully their new wireless, which runs on one AA battery will not have any issues.  However, this one's a dud 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 I recently read Robert Monroe's first book, "Journeys Out of Body" and found it to be a disappointment - it was just weird. As I noted in my review of that book, I had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound, for which he is allegedly noted. As I purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read, I thought I'd give it a try.   The book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his "research" and I thought that, perhaps, this book might actually have some real substance. That belief; however, quickly disappeared. By the time I had reached the half-way point in the book, nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish. How does total garbage like this manage to get printed?!  There are those that claim that Monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain. If this book is any indication, one can't help but wonder if Monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! There is nothing logical or, for that matter, even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book. It would have been worthwhile if Monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner. Instead, he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own, personal, dream experiences: these wander so aimlessly, from paragraph to paragraph, that one can't help but wonder what real point, if any, he was trying to make.  The really sad thing is that I had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - I was actually quite interested in the topic. Having now been subjected to two of his useless books, I'm amazed that they're still in print. This is pseudo-science at its absolute worst. 
 In trying to counteract the perils of feminism in modern society without appearing too biased, Gilder goes ludicrously overboard by offering the "savage barbarian" thesis as an olive branch. In short, the all-consuming strength of the more societal and nurturing female is, according to Gilder, what 'straightens out' the otherwise savage and single human male. He offers as 'proof' such data as higher unemployment, mental illness, alcoholism, etc. among unmarried males. However, Gilder's claims---however beautifully written they may be---are not entirely accurate and are largely projections of his own philosophical agenda.    For example, unmarried people might have more of a tendency toward societal and/or psychological problems simply because their lack of socialization makes them more pre-disposed to such problems, not because they aren't married. You know, the fellow who doesn?t like people, who tends to be a loner, or who has never matured in maintaining *any* social relationship is not likely to get married let alone hold a job. In fact, Gilder fails to point out the epidemic of depression, alcoholism and other issues that can strike anyone----whether unmarried and ?barbaric?, or married with good jobs and nice families. Equally significant is the marked successes enjoyed by unmarried groups of males---countless hundreds of thousands who work as single professionals and choose bachelorhood for indefnite periods---perhaps as a ?trial? period to find a suitable mate, not to hunt for sexual prizes as predators. [Other successfull groups are liberated gay males who historically are among the more educated and higher achievers in society. I suppose that Gilder would respond by saying that gay men are less likely to be in the ?savage?category list and thus, more prone to toward culturization without the influence of wives. However, gay men are often just as sexually aggressive and masculine as their straight counterparts so where?s the inevitable barbarianism?] And what about the 50% infidelity rate among married men---many of whom have wonderful families and loving wives? Could it be that barbarianism never leaves the male, or that he is simply hardwired to always take part in the ?hunt?---despite the so-called powerful neutralizing influence of woman? Whatever the answers, Gilder?s grand over idealized scheme doesn?t seem to fit.    Another problem is Gilder?s notion that the primary subconscious motivation of intercourse is to bear children, not simply ?screw? around. But if true, then why do post-menopausal women enjoy sexual relations when they---and their body---know that children are not in the cards? Why do people often avoid, at all costs, the bearing of offspring via birth control and sometimes even abortion?     Gilder?s book is not without merit, as the idea of the nurturing female sensibilities counterbalancing the sometimes cruder and more aggressive male nature is probably somewhat accurate. And it?s also true that the push for women to act more like men has indeed made society a more crass and cruder place---but not necessarily because men are crass, but perhaps because women are acting less like women and losing the moral impetus of males to play more chivalrous and respectable mating roles? In conclusion, to simply assign all-consuming power to womanhood as the sole balancing act in society and to render, by default, males as pretty much hopeless brutes unable to change sans the influence of their counterparts *is* cynical, ridiculously sexist, and without any scientific basis whatsoever. [Imagine the reverse being written---that women would basically self-destruct without the presence of men?? A national outcry on Capital Hill would occur.] Perhaps Mr. Gilder might try a different tack that avoids trashing men, and sucking up to women as the master saviors of the human race 
 When I heard Kasabian's first single, "Club Foot", I was hooked. When I heard the rest of the album, I was disappointed, but still worth it. I recently downloaded their sophomore album, and I am horrified. It is very, very bad. It all sounds like a bad remix of their first album with new lyrics. Synth bass on every song, simple drums, synth guitar, uninspired lyrics, and guess what else, synthesizers. All there really is (on the majority of the album) is synth noise. Loud, synthesized noise with monotone lyrics. With most of the songs, I was ready to skip the track, but not because it's bad, but because it goes on too long. If you like it, that's fine, I'm just saying that it's just an expansion of their first album, but worse.  1.Empire: 4/10 Strings are nice, vocals are ok, but everything else is sub-par. 2. Shoot the Runner: 4/10 Good riff, bad vocals and lyrics. "I'm the king, and she's my queen, b****!" 3. Last Trip: 3/10 Tedious, goes on about a minute too long. 4. Me Plus One: 2/10 See above. But this song has strings!! 5. Sun/Rise/Light/Flies: 8/10 This is the only song really worth listening to. 6. Apneoea: -2/10 Loud, obnoxious, and at 1:45, it's still too long. "Aaaapneeooooea!!" 7. By My Side: 4/10 An up-to-par song ruined by both being too long, and by being repetitive. 8. Stuntman: 5/10 Good as background music, because there's nothing standing out. 9. Seek and Destroy: 1/10 Ugh. There is nothing to split it apart from all the other tracks. 10. British Legion: 1/10 Takes a minute and a half to almost get started, but when the rest of the band comes in, it gets worse. 11. The Doberman: 1/10 This song is not good. At all. It goes on two minutes longer than it should've. The ending is almost worth listening to, but the horns are stolen from Muse's "City of Delusion."  31/110=28%=Don't buy this album 
 should have known when dylan said what a great singer she was. will be selling this one used to the record store as soon as possible. surely not a hidden ge 
 Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud 
 Moorcock has definitely lost his edge. Why is it that the vast majority of artists and writers seem to produce their best work (Elric, in Moorcock's case) in the early days of their careers, and then after that it's all downhill? Moorcock is a fine example, Stephen King another. It seems they were great writers when they were young and lean and angry, but then once success hits they become soft-bellied and mellow and lose the restless soul that was the wellspring of their creativity. Finally, by the twilight of their careers they are doing nothing more than rehashing the same old plots and ideas over and over again (isn't anyone sick of this whole Multiverse/Eternal Champion stuff by now?), which could possibly be overlooked if their writing was still as compelling as it once was, but when you have a seriously watered-down Elric (who rightfully should have never been written about again after Stormbringer) and 12-year old English girls as major characters in your book, things are looking pretty grim. Please, kill Elric off once and for all and never write about him again. It definitely would have been better for him to burn out than fade away. You've cheapened him enough at this point. Just leave him with what little dignity he has left 
 Boring, tasteless and unoriginal. Photographer has an obvious fixation...which has kept him from paying attention in many cases to contrast, tone, and line. One star for the big you know what, the real model here. I'm sure book has its merits, but they aren't artistic. Putting my copy up for sale 
 I have purchase this product few months ago for my parents. They have high blood pressure problem.  We checked the product online and trust the product description. But when we start to use it, we found that the measured values are so much diffrent than actual pressure. We follow each and every step stated to get the accurate result, but for some reason this product fails to give correct readings.  This may create serious problem because my mother got very high blood pressure even if this machine shows below normal. Do not compromise with your health 
 While I rarely subscribe to magazines, I was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so I signed up for a one year subscription to Shape. Before and during college I was a ballet dancer, but after entering the real, 9-5 working world half a year ago, exercise time became more difficult to find. Unfortunately, I found that Shape magazine was not really about exercise at all. It was about beauty products, fancy new-age spas and resorts, and trendy workout accessories. I was also shocked by the models on the magazine's covers and pages. Not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing. I finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through, lacy top on the front of it, visible nipples and all. Workout wear? I think not! Trust me, the woman belonged in a porn magazine, not my exercise magazine 
 Very disappointing version of this story.  I was hoping to see the actual Horton, animation and all and this was a page turner with a voice attached.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Don't bother 
 Does not come with the CD as stated.  Emailed the manufacturer and never got a response back 
 I picked this book off the library shelf because I like a good mystery, but this seems to be a book about foxhunting with a sparse mystery story added as an afterthought.  It was disappointing in many respects:  hollow characters, poor writing, unrealistic dialogue.  I haven't read any other Rita Mae Brown, but I'm a little confused by her popularity.  If this is representative of her work, she's not a writer 
 According to Armstrong ADD is a conspiracy theory?  I just couldn't get past that!  I looked at a few of the 50 ways... Less TV?  Do you really need to include that?  Common sense!! 
 A complete waste of money, even at 1 cent. Once applied the screen is significantly less viewable. The "clear" shield is about 10% opaque! Avoid this one at all costs.  [later] It appears the shield I received wasn't a DioFilm but a cheapo one they give with eh DioSkinz. I've asked that they send me a DioFilm for review. We'll see 
 There are many different opinions about this book. I did read Hotel Paradise but don't remember reading Cold Flat Junction, so that may account for the reasons why I had a hard time getting into this book. I have read Grimes' other novels and numerous Jury books, and I like her style of writing. This book is just not up to par with the others 
 This is an okay product with many, many parts to clean.  The spout, the ring for the top of the cup, the handles, and the plastic "leak stopper", oh, and the cup!  All the parts fly around the dishwahser.  I've lost many stoppers so I've had to order through Avent.  The good thing is they don't leak.  
 I received a box of these cases and about 20 out of 100 were broken upon arrival because they are so fragile.  If they are handled carefully, they work well, but the hinges are easily broken. Unfortunately, not a lot of selection on Amazon for this type of clear CD case 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 Esto es un disco recopilatorio, no la partitura de Danny Elfman, que se la despachan con dos cortes. ¿Dónde está la original? ¿Ya está descatalogada? Entonces sólo queda una solución.. 
 This book contains 100 pages if you count blank pages (really 50) of 12 different patterns repeated 4 times on low grade paper.  As tiling patterns go these are somewhere well short of ultimate 
 Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL 
 About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, & I've used all of them, & had their (file removal) tech help give up.  In this day & age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself.  If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care.  How important are your pictures to you?   Frederic 
 Colson's version of what happened during Watergate is a self-serving, sanctimonious whitewash of what he did and what he was responsible for. As the self-syled " Go-to guy" when something needed to be done. As Howard Hunt's boss, it defies belief that he was ignorant of what went on. He managed to get away without any responsibility for what he was surely guilty of and plead guilty to a crime of his choosing, which he hoped not to serve any time for.Surely to be "Born Again" he needs to tell the whole truth rather than this sanitized version 
 I enjoyed the parts regarding the S.S. Valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for me. Except for Picard, who we of course know quite well from the series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. We never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. The whole "adversarial" situation with the 1st Officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for Picard 
 From what I can tell by the reviews on this page, all the proposals in this book are basically libertarian. It is thus highly misleading that the book calls itself centrist. The fact that only one person on this page has realized this, yet seems to think it's a good thing, is also rather disturbing.  The book seems like a thinly veiled attempt to move political dialogue rightward by making radical neoconservative proposals--many of which the Bush administration clearly supports--seem moderate.  Let's call a spade a spade 
 Winter's tale is a series of connected vignettes taking place in Manhattan and upper state New York, spanning more than a century. It is really an ode to a fictionalized version of New York City, from its slums to the homes of its movers and shakers. It is the tale of the search for the perfectly just golden city, that New York is (unbeknownst to most of its inhabitants) striving to become.    Winter's Tale is a maddening book. Helprin is an extremely gifted writer and individual passages are a delight to read. But the story meanders over its 600 pages. There is no coherent plotline. All I can say is that it took me 6 months to wade through it. It is long and it is dull 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 It's quite funny to see people rave about the beautiful "Hedwig's Theme" melody.  Yes, it was beautiful when Tchaikovsky composed it 150 years ago as the Andante from his ballet "Swan Lake."  Williams shamelessly copied the melody for his "Hedwig's Theme".  I'm a little astonished that the producers let this plagiarism slip by, but perhaps they're still waiting for spine donors.  Williams also steals other music from himself as well as classical composers for this score.  It's a shame that once he hit his sixties he can't be original anymore.  Or maybe it's Alzheimer's disease and he just can't remember that someone else wrote it first.. 
 I don't know what everyone else is listening to, but I listed to this album and it put me to sleep. For real. There's nothing new here and everything sounds the same. In other words: "Ghetto Classics" is boring. There's not even one song on here that could be a "ghetto classic." 
 Gods Old and Dark, the last novel in fantasy author Holly Lisle's acclaimed World Gates trilogy, wasn't just a book about a  colossal battle for the survival of Earth. It was a colossal struggle to finish, as well, as Lisle frantically tried to end the series before page 325.   The novel begins with the Sentinels of Cat Creek, a secret organization to save the world, discovering that Lauren Dane, her sister Molly, and some of their friends are using magic without their permission and drawing the attention of the evil Night Watch. They slowly get sucked into the war between Molly and the dark gods, with Thor (yes, that Thor) as an ally and a chance to become gods themselves. Sounds exciting, right? It's too bad that completing the series with the flair it started with seemed to be the farthest thing from Lisle's mind. From page one, Thor is a deus ex machina, sent to get the Sentinels out of a bind that Lisle hadn't thought through completely. While he does get a (very) little bit of character development, he also consistently saves the day for Lauren and her magic-wielding army, rendering the struggles faced by the characters of the first two novels pointless.   Lisle hurtles from battle to battle and scene to scene with a speed that gives the novel a rushed feel instead of a suspenseful tone, as though she wanted to move on to other, more important projects. Characters are made immortal, taking away suspense; if the reader doesn't fear for the death of a character, it takes half of the fun out of a book. The end, too, is unsatisfying. Loose ends are left behind with the FBI, two of the Sentinels, and the Night Watch, as though Lisle forgot that she wouldn't be returning to the series. The end feels like a sloppy attempt to end a series intended to go on for several more books.  The one major satisfaction in the novel is the redemption of Baanraak, one of the evil Night Watch. While even that is sloppy - Lisle uses a plot device rather than an honest character development - Baanraak and those involved in his part of the plot are the only compelling characters in the story. His eccentric romance with Molly is one of the few pleasures of Gods Old and Dark.  While Lisle's latest novel gives some closure to the World Gates trilogy, it does not live up to the stirring and multifaceted tale begun with The Memory of Fire, nor is it on par with Lisle's other work. The Chicago Sun-Times described Holly Lisle as "an author unlikely to write a sloppy or stupid book." It is this reviewer's hope that this remains Lisle's only attempt to prove them wrong 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 The title of the book is attractive. That's why I purchased a copy.  Other than that, the book could be easily summarized on one page with a couple good suggestions.  Otherwise, it feels like a con-job, and a waste of money 
 I heard good things about Pulp so I downloaded this album.  Maybe I should have downloaded This Is Hardcore, which I haven't listened to, since this didn't impress me.  In fact it bored me.  Its not that I don't like dreary music, I like The Cure and Joy Division.  Noting almost at all, beside Babies, is worth buying.  Babies is really a great track and I stick it on mixes I make relatively often.  But I found nothing else on this cd that made me want to listen to it.  But I did listen to it, two more times in fact.  And I still couldn't find even one more positive thing about it the next two times through.  Jarvis Cocker is a cool singer and lifts the album's lackluster songs a half a notch.  But singing is not a real big deal to me when I listen to music,  hardcore.  A good singer doesn't make a band good, although it doesn't hurt any.  The songs try to sound epic but they just come off sounding dull.  Like I said if you want a 'good' idea of what Pulp sound like on this album just download Babies and scrap the rest of the material because it would just be a waste of a good fifteen bucks 
 2/15/07 - Received coffee maker with minor outside box damage but eveything seemed intact. Made several pots of very good coffee and espresso but after 4 days the main switch and digital readout went crazy and the water heating element for the coffee side refused to turn off. I had to unplug the unit fearing a fire. I am returning the unit to Delonghi. I will review the new unit after I have had it for a while.  4/2/07 - I recieved the new unit in good condition and set it up with some trepidation (see earlier review). All the functions work fine and the coffee/espresso maker has been chugging along fine. It has made more than 50 pots of very good coffe and about 30 pots of espresso that even my Cuban colleagues enjoy. Based on my experience with the new unit so far, I would increase my rating to 4 stars, however Amazon will only allow one review per person. 
 nothing really extraordinary here.  lots of slandering dark-skinned peoples with the word "savages" thereby excusing genocidal and land-grabbing actions by the more "civilized" Xtian believing "aryans" who of course have evolved beyond all that superstition by emblazoning their one true god on their only appropriate place of worship--dollar bills 
 I swear, this is the worst book i have ever been forced to read. THE. WORST. I hated this book because: 1. The main character is a complete idiot. 2. The entire plot makes no sense. 3. It's historical fiction, which is known to be boring. 4. When I was reading it, I read 10 pages into the book and fell asleep.  I mean, why waste your time on writing this?  Okay. A summary:  So there's this guy named True Son, he's white but he lives with Native Americans, he's taken away from them, he runs away, he gets all flaky and stupid, he returns to his white family (so he says) and it sucks. A lot.  Don't waste your money, seriously 
 I have just put this book down, a little more than halfway through. The only other author I've ever done that for is Robert Ludlum. Like Ludlum, Hamilton has never met a word he didn't like. Every person place or thing has multiple modifiers and the action is explained, rather than allowed to unfold. Add some cliche characters (Dead-head style Techno Billionaire wandering through space, 'Right-Stuff' Space Captain, etc) include way too many side plots and story lines and this wandering, undisciplined tome is just too much work. Are there no editors? No red pencils or pens? If I knew his address I'd send Peter Hamilton a copy of Strunk & White. There are still some great Alien-Culture, Hyperspace-Travel genre sic-fi books out there. This isn't one of them  
 I have to agree with the other one-star reviewer Jim-Jim. Of all of my Jazz Books, and I have quite a few of them, I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would praise this book. There is nothing in it but disembodied scale fragments, patterns and note combinations (which the author calls "cells"), which are totally useless on their own melodically, and the author offers no suggestions for left hand voicings or detailed harmonizations under them. Oh yes, he also includes some bafflingly minuscule snippets on "theory" which don't come close to explaining in any organic way the mysteries and complexities of beautiful jazz understanding. Almost nothing in the book "sounds" good on its own, and I would never mistake any of these naked, unharmonized note combinations as "vocabulary" if I heard them in, say, a jazz club. The best I could do with this book is play the pages as exercises, an experience which was joyless and mind-numbing. The title is completely misleading. P.S. I NEVER want to hear any of the people "play jazz" who have awarded this book with 5 stars if they have in any way used this book as a primary reference for their playing 
 Not sure as to WHERE these numerous upbeat reviews of this reissue came from.Question:did these fans even listen to this CD?I've been a HUGE Alice Cooper fan since his original band released 'Killer' and 'School's Out',but this 1983 release really bites!!Nice lp cover,though.Just two cuts here even make the CD semi-worth keeping the disc around,which are the title track "Dada" where it appears that Alice is sitting on a couch telling his problems to his psychologist and "Former Lee Warner" where he speaks about his deformed brother the family needs to keep hidden in the upstairs room.For die-hards ONLY 
 Started reading this book but quickly put it away. I wasn't really impressed with it so much. I have better ones that are so much better and more impressive 
 This movie was not Bill Murray's  best. I would not recommend it to anyone 
 Some books, in my opinion, are just plain overrated.  The characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting.  Likewise the tale.  The reader takes nothing from it. Put this in a list with Franzen's The Corrections and Frazier's Cold Mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades 
 I am taking a class in Dreamweaver and Flash.  One of my teachers has required that we purchase this book and the other teacher in my flash class has us purchasing a book by lynda.com. I hate this book because if you don't know what you are doing, don't buy this book.  They leave out a lot of important information.  I got so frustrated in trying to finish the exercises that I just would eventually stop.  Further in the book they might tell you what you needed to know back a few chapters ago.  Poorly written.  Not for beginners.  The other book was great.  Lynda.com books are more in detail and they are written correctly.   
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 This isn't a terrible album, but when you look at the work of Max's work with Sepultura, this just doesn't really hit a nerve. There are some very good tracks here, but some of the tracks are just plain awful, and Bleed would have been so much better without Fred Durst (hey I don't hate Limp Biskit, I do like a handful of songs, but Fred just doesn't belong with Soulfly) but there things do get better for Soulfly as their music gets better as the albums go on.. 
 I don't see what people like about this movie. I found it to be very boring. I liked Full Metal Jacket, Pearl Harbor, and Saving Private Ryan, a whole lot more than this dud 
 Excellent book on the life of Benjamin Franklin.  He certainly was a genius and full of surprizes 
 MOTORIN'... WHAT'S YOUR PRICE FOR FLIGHT!?!?  Or something.  These guys are as 80's as it gets.  More 80's than Nitro even!  I mean just LOOK at the guy at the bottom right!!!  Me and my roommate like to sit out back of our house and blast this album (on VINYL of course... what would 80's think if we did so on CD?).  Not only that but we also drink 8% beer.  Not only that but we sing along.  LOUD.  In fact every time Sister Christian comes on we crank the stereo to the max... or rather the maxx.  Because in the 80's you had to use additional x's for words of that sort.  We abuse our neighbours too often and the cops get called pretty much every other weekend.  Night Ranger has cost us hundreds of $$$ in fines.  In fact, the neighbours directly adjacent to us have moved out as of November 1st.  True story 
 If you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead.  If you want better exercises and articles look to Oxygen or Women's M& 
 Copyrighted in 2001, the Cisco CCNP library has already been rendered obsolete by Cisco themselves.  Not only exam revisions, but a fundamental structural change to the CCNP examination series has taken place in the short time since these books were put on the market.  Unfortunately, I can see no other benefit to these books beyond providing a revenue stream to Cisco.  There are better books available if one is looking for truly educational technical books rather than exam-specific guides 
 war books are not my favorite, but even so this book sucked. i will admit when i am wrong about a book but i was not wrong about this 1. from the moment my prof. assigned it, i knew it would be like pulling teeth to finish and it was! this is notttttttttttttttttttttt a classic or anything close to 1. spend ur ten dollars on a pillow cause you are going to need it 
 I worked hard on a VCD project for work using Photo Explosion. I didn't think it was that easy to use, but it was okay until I got ready to burn.  Got a little error message that said something along the lines of "You don't have Nero burners!" No kidding, but there are four other burn programs on my computer. Nothing but Nero would do.  NOWHERE on the box are you informed of this.  It says, and I quote, "Burn CD slideshows you can watch on tv!" Needing more software is never mentioned. As far as I'm concerned, this product makes fraudulent claims.  I will never buy another one of their products 
 It takes better than two hours to find out if the faux legendary pianist 1900 will go down with the Virginian when it is blown up at sea after being taken out of service.  And it is two completely wasted hours.  Hard to say what is most annoying -- the omnipresent voiceover, the philosophical twaddle that rationalizes why he never leaves the ship, the philosophical twaddle when he almost leaves the ship, the bad acting, the farcical piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton, the fleeting love story with a young passenger who looks like Amelia Earhart confused about why she's on a ship instead of her plane. The movie is splendidly photographed -- give it that much.  I watched it because of the director's earlier Cinema Paradiso.  He is a far better cinematic teller of memoirs than of fables.  
 I must admit I stopped reading this book after thirty pages. I read a few more pages here and there.   It's all the same - Blah. Blah. Blah. I'm fat. Blah. Blah. Blah. I hate myself.  There was an exciting moment - Blah. Blah. I had a friend. She was fat, too. Blah.  I just couldn't read this book. I wasn't engaged. I didn't care. Moore appears to have a bigger issue than weight. What that issue is, I'm not quite sure, but I don't care.  I never finished the book. Blah. Blah. Blah. 
 I am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject.  There was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title.  I read this book because it was the subject of an on-line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group. 
 While some "enlightened" souls are being "struck" by the "ignorance of many reviews" here, some of us are busy being glad we weren't literally in danger of being struck by Hooks herself, when we read lines like this:  "I am writing this essay sitting beside an anonymous white male that I long to murder."  This is the "strong language" we must look past.   This book is nothing more than yet another piece of dung on the pile of anti-White racism in this country. Had a white American written something similar about his discontent at living in a society which denies him jobs in favour of lesser qualified minorities, destroys his public schools with busing, denies him the right of free association, plagues him with the stupendously high crime rates of other non-white citizens (and yet others illegal aliens), he'd be vilified by the same self-hating Whites who dared post here to express their feeble-minded shock at all the "ignorance."  Hooks is a racist, and her book is racist filth. No amount of propaganda will ever change the fact, no matter how much the sheep ruffle their feathers over it 
 I certainly agree that Portis is a talented writer, but I just didn't find him all that funny.  Perhaps I'm missing something, but I thought that the characters were strange enough, not amusing, just strange.  I was frustrated by the characters and the world that they inhabited.  I forced myself to finish the book and I was rewarded by the one funny line in the whole book, which comes at the very end of the novel 
 I'll second Bargain Savvy Mom's review. I don't want a brush to vacuum large, flat, smooth surfaces. I can use a cloth to wipe dust off those kinds of surfaces. I want a brush to dust rough or textured surfaces, such as fabrics, speaker grills, textured walls, that sort of thing. This simply doesn't work for any of those. If you look closely at the picture you'll notice that the bristles on this brush flare out at a pretty wide angle. What you can't see is that the bristles are very stiff. As a result, if you are trying to dust anything other than a hard smooth surface the leading bristles constantly grab the surface you're dusting and you feel like you're fighting with it all the time. Softer bristles pointed more straight down would have been a lot better. I tried this on a few things but just found it to be useless for what I wanted to do with it. Your mileage may vary.  Oh, and $30 seems way overpriced for this light weight thing made from cheap plastic 
 I expected information about design, but this is just a self serving "I am good at what I do" book. I am sure he is good but there is little or no information about how to actually desigh furniture. No proportions, no instruction except make your mistakes on paper by sketching first. A waste of good money. 
 This book was recomended to me by a naturopath. It was easy enough to read in just one evening. The sections about how bones grow and what your risk factors are for getting osteoporosis were quite good. There is also good advice about what vitamins and minerals in addition to calcium to include in your diet, as well as the importance of vitamin D and sunshine, for calcium absorbtion. However, the food section is confusing. Nelson does not mention sea vegetables as the best food source of calcium and minerals to include in a healthy diet. And since she has the opinion that a person can get all the calcium they need from food sources, she should have included a more accurate calcium food chart in her book. For example, spinach, which tops the vegetable calcium secton, contains a lot of oxalic acid which interfers with calcium absorbtion. Nelson mentions the oxalic acid problem with some foods, but never mentions exactly which foods contain the highest amounts. Instead she says we should eat these foods for other reasons. So, why is spinach at the top of the calcium chart? Let's have a more accurate chart before telling people they can just add up what they are taking in with the chart she provides. Also, in her section on exercises she encourages women over 50 to jump vertically to retain calcium. A woman should gradually build up to 2 full minutes of jumping. What if a persons knees are not in alignment? Jumping is one of the most jarring and hardest things a person can do to their knee joints, especially if they are heavy on their feet. A woman who is over 50 and not used to exercising could easily get injured with this jumping program. I am over 50, and I already exercise 5 or 6 days a week, doing aerobics, running and weight training. I tried jumping vertically at a fitness center in front of a mirror to make sure I did it correctly. Then I went on to do a leg press, which I do on a regular basis, and my left knee hurt. My personal trainer said running would be much better for me than jumping. I do not have joint problems, yet, but I could after Neilson's exercise program. Also, the medication section encourages every woman to consider hormone replacement therapy. Does we all really need this therapy? I am discouraged that this book was rated so highly and recomended. It was mostly a waste of money. Only the first couple sections in the book were really worth reading. Check it out at the library or buy it used if you must 
 When I picked up this book I was delighted, especially if it were like the other 2 books - Undead and Unwed and Undead and Unemployed.  Oh, how I loved and adored Queen Betsy and found her ditzyness to be hilarious- in the other 2 books.    This book brought much disappointment to me - I felt that it did not have a real plot to the story and it was going no where fast.  The story of Betsy and her stepmother is getting old to me.  They fight - we get that!  They hate each other - we get that!  Lets get something else please - something totally unrelated to the stepmother.    While I would recommend Undead and Unwed - that one is hysterical!!  I would not waste my time again by reading this book.  It went no where fast and continued going no where.    Please go back to developing the characters and DIFFERENT situations that Betsy the vampire queen can get herself into trouble - I am really bored with the family drama - an "undead" girl should just be able to get over and move on with her undead life.  
 I ordered this for my 3 year old and while he likes putting the puzzle together the sounds are completely random and unreliable.  I've tried everything I can think of.  Sometimes it makes sounds and sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes it makes only one letter sound for all the letters.  Sometimes it makes some sounds but not others.  I've used new batteries etc.  But the puzzle is OK if you just remove the batteries.  Not worth the price tag though 
 I loved Gilad from watching him on ESPN and LOVE the beach scenes.  However, I felt like he went too fast; I was playing catch-up because he switched from one thing to another very quickly.  There weren't a lot of repeats before moving on to something new.  Maybe if I did it more and got used to it, I wouldn't mind.  However, I much prefer my Kathy Smith and Cathe videos.  This one is just collecting dust for me right now.  Maybe I'll give it a try another time, but I regret buying it 
 I usually enjoy her books but this one was truly disappointing. Such a silly plot. I finished it but kept saying to myself..."Why not just toss this one?" 
 This book is pure fiction.  Been trying to do what the book says for almost a year.  Have not been successful.  I guess if you are psychic than it works, but not for the rest of us untalented individuals.  What a total  let down.  Maybe her angels should have told her that the book wouldn't  work 
 I'm a pretty good piano player. But I had trouble playing the songs in this book. I think this book is only good for the lyrics but not for the music 
 I rated it one star because I couldn't go any lower 
 I wish there was a space for zero stars.  We bought this frame for my in-laws for Christmas and it worked for TEN MINUTES and then died.  It was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here, others have had a problem with it freezing.  Once it does that, there's no fixing it, apparently.  Do some research and buy another unit; that's what I'm going to do 
 Hi my name is Jillian and I didn't care for this book. I don't like working so my advice is to become a rockstar 
 This film was a little disappointing.  There was less humor and more attempts at simple shock value that seemed to mostly entertain the people making the film.  Please don't make a third film 
 This release should have been titled Michael Nyman: Gattaca Soundtrack, since that's all that it is. A collection of Nyman's tracks.   And yes, they are very good, no doubt about it, but where is Charlie Haden and Stan Getz's exquisite "First Song (for Ruth)", the wonderfully emotional smoky jazz number from the scene on the dancing floor? And what happened to Django Reinhardt's "Nuages" ?  If they included ALL THE ARTISTS' work on this cd, it would earn the right to be called "a soundtrack". Why did the producers emphasize only Nyman? Don't they want to make the best soundtrack compilation for us from the music pieces the movie provides? No, they don't. Including Nyman exclusively was a marketing decision, and not a move towards satisfying their listeners. For that - this cd gets one star. Since Nyman's work is so good, i'll give it two stars 
 I have to admit that I feel somewhat embarrassed at having bought this two-disk set, but I guess it serves as a testimonial to advertising. Had it not been for my 10-year old son seeing the television commercials for this collection and then asking me to buy it, you can be quite sure that I never would have seen the inside of this jewel box. Besides, I already owned a slew of early Chicago albums (the first up to Chicago IX) and I had not given them much attention in the past, oh, thirty years or so. There's a reason for that. The two-disk sets that they released habitually back in the early seventies were mostly bloated affairs, full of good playing but lousy music, with the exception of the radio-friendly hits that were interspersed throughout. I guess that it comes as no surprise, then, that this collection is also a two-CD set, but with precious little padding. Throughout the seventies, Chicago virtually defined pop radio. If you were to draw a timeline of their career, they could easily be fingered for abandoning FM for AM, thus sounding the impending death knell for progressive radio. For these and a few other reasons, these guys were never favorites of mine, so I hesitated to buy this for my son, until the discounted price reeled me in (I paid $18). For the money, this collection does a remarkable job of covering the band's hits, offering 39 songs, almost all of which were top 40 at one time or another. The question is, do you care any more than I do? Essentially, Chicago were/are two completely different bands. The `classic' Chicago is represented on disk one, with obvious hits like "Saturday in the Park", "Feelin' Stronger Every Day", "Colour My World", "25 or 6 to 4" (whatever that means - after three decades, I still don't know - or care) and "Make Me Smile". Arranged chronologically by chart appearance, some songs survive better than others; "Lowdown" still sounds pretty cool, and the new edit of Beginnings" balances out nicely. Dated as all hell, these songs at least work well as nostalgia. The real problem here is disk two. Some time in the late 70's, Chicago dropped their stylistic calling card and became one of the most flagrant abusers of compression in the business. By taking a mediocre melody and drenching it in studio bombast - echo, reverb, and that ridiculous cannon-shot snare drum - I can hardly tell any of these twenty songs apart. Nevertheless, somebody was buying this stuff, if chart position means anything ("Hard to Say I'm Sorry", "Hard Habit to Break", "You're the Inspiration" "Will You Still Love Me", "I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love" and "Look Away" were all top three singles). I don't care. I still think this stuff sucks, but hey, the disk is cheap. You could buy it, bring it home, break out the old photo album, and play disk one. You can use disk two as a coaster for your cocktail.		B-		Tom Rya 
 I believe that the title of this book is misleading and the content does not live up to expectations at all. If I could, I would demand my money back.   What I expected in light of the title and other reviews was a light-hearted, witty and clever, perhaps sometimes self-deprecating and mostly amusing look at women's lifes and how we often stand in our own way with our sense of ueber-perfectionism.   What I got was a tedious read, and if I were in a nasty mood, I would even go as far as to say it was badly written. Veronica Chambers is trying too hard to be funny, and trust me, it doesn't work. Both, her style and the content did nothing to even remotely endear her to me and most of the time I was simply bored.   Maybe it is my fault and I had the wrong expectations, but even bearing that possibility in mind, it still doesn't deliver on the promise in the title.   Maybe it wouldn't have been as bad had she given it a title that reflected more of what the book really is: a diary of a woman who doesn't really have an awfult lot to say.   Which in itself wouldn't even be that bad, seeing as I have read numerous accounts of women who didn't really have much to say either - but they did so in such a charming, clever, witty and sometimes ironic way that made it possible to connect, or at least be entertained.   This book unfortunately does neither 
 The book is almost nothing about the garage you already own.  It is about fancy buildings with garage doors to use as offices, dwellings, exhibit spaces, furniture factories, archtectural statements.  If you want to keep your car dry, you will need to build another real garage 
 Yes, free enterprise capitalism brings more economic benefits than socialism.  Reagan's tax cuts worked.  There is a great moral truth that people should retain their earnings rather than fork them over to the state bureaucracy.  Yet, the Reagan boom did not lift all boats.  The mediocre and the inept slipped backward in the 80s just as they have during the Clinton boom of the 90s.  The rise of the two wage-earner family, much of it forced on mothers due to economic circumstances (continued high taxes, the collapse of high wage, semi-skilled jobs) is a shame which neither Republican or Democrat or liberal or conservative have really attempted to tackle.  The press release, prevelant during the Clinton and Reagan booms, of "We've created ___ million jobs in __ years" is a lazy, stupid, dishonest sort of boast. The families of America would be better off with fewer but better paid jobs rather than a bunch of $8/hr. jobs. The New Class, either conservative or liberal, does not seem to understand it.  Mr. Bartley does not understand 
 I was very disapointed in Stepaniak's new book, being a big fan of several of her previous works.  There is very little really "new" here--and some old recipies repeated from previous books!  The recipes are  uninspired, and the work as a whole is not worth the money.  Come on,  Joanne, we know you can do better 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 You win some and you lose some. This purchase was a definite loss. What a dissapointment 
 I ordered this libretto with the purchase of possibly the very best recording of Carmen (Sir Thomas Beecham - Victoria de los Angeles) so that I could follow along with the Opera.  As I speak fluent French, I initially didn't even glance at the "translation" in the libretto, but once I did, I couldn't help but notice that there were translation errors on virtually every page.  I then started to focus on what was "translated" and found that there were additions made to what was actually being sung, omissions to what was being sung and variations of what was being sung.  The translation was apparently done by someone who took French 20 years ago in college.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
 If you're looking for an accurate hygrometer, this isn't it! it was 15 points off when I tested it for accuracy! Amazon is taking back as defective so, i'm glad I bought it at Amazon 
 This book is really a waste of time. Being an intelligent Christian, I loved Lee Strobel's book "The Case For Christ." I do not have blind faith, and in this spirit, I decided to see what Earl had to say about the book. It strengthened my faith in Jesus Christ by showing to just what lengths some people will go in their attempts to cast doubt on our Savior. He actually arrogantly taunted these incredible, well known scholars in this book that would intellectually tear him apart in person. I researched the author's credentials as well. They are not in the same league with those he "pretend" cross-examined in his book. The contents of the book and the manner in which the arguments are presented, reveal the author very well. I knew when I bought the book I would likely disagree with most of it, but I did not expect such an unprofessional approach. I read it from cover to cover, but this was painful at times with tangents that turned out irrelevant, in an attempt to make a counter argument.  I recommend that Earl read "The Case For A Creator," by Lee Strobel. IT TRULY DOES TAKE MORE FAITH to believe in naturalism, which he constantly referred to in "Challenging The Verdict" as a proof source for scientific backing for some of his theories. I would like to see him cross-examine some of the scientific experts in this book, who are recognized as some of the top scholars in their fields, and some who are former naturalists themselves. I am sure he would though (by book, but never in person) and I bet there are some people out there that are just nave enough to read it and listen to him.  Any author who tries to disprove our Creator, His written Word and our Savior Jesus Christ will always miss the boat on two things. 1) There is not an airtight case. If it were, then faith would not be required. It takes faith and study of the scriptures to reach a point where you are spiritually mature enough to really understand why. What I don't understand, I have faith that God will reveal in his own time and according to his own plan. 2) These scholarly attempts to disprove a Creator, or our risen, living Savior, sidetrack and cloud issues that in the end, just do not matter! What matters is JESUS! Once you have experienced Him, there is absolutely no argument sound enough to make a true Christian turn, because it is real 
 Once upon a time I was given a vanity-published book to review. It was an illogical mess, full of breathtaking non-sequiturs. While reading "Iron John," I couldn't help thinking of it. The vanity book, however, was at least entertaining.  John Eldredge refers to "Iron John" liberally in his book "Wild at Heart," and because I considered that a ringing endorsement, I purchased a copy. I can't tell you what a chore it has been to finally finish reading it. The hardest part was not flinging it away in disgust about 17 times.  It's one thing to write a rambling tome full of obscure references; it's another to publish it. That people can slog through it and call it "profound" and "important" is baffling; what's even more mind-boggling is that people claim that this book "spoke" to them. I think it's a case of "I'd better say I understand it, or people will think I'm not erudite." Well, let me be erudite about it: "Iron John" is a big, steaming pile of New Age crapola. Don't say I didn't warn you 
 I just finished this book and I must say I am glad I didn't invest in the author's previous effort on Cary Grant...  Let's start off with the pros:  The chapters on Stewart's service in World War II were quite good, and gave me a great deal of information I was unaware of.  The bibliography is quite extensive and gave me some ideas for follow-up reading, particularly film scholar/critic Andrew Sarris' work.  (Eliot studied under Sarris and quotes him extensively.)  One of the best threads that runs through the book concerns the lifellong friendship between Stewart and Henry Fonda, who were united by fundamental similarities in their characters and backgrounds, but divided, sometimes heatedly, by their politics and world views.  The obligatory while-making-the-film anecdotes are often entertaining.  And finally, the section on Stewart's later life, the death of his son in Viet Nam and his retirement from film is quite touching.  As far as film analysis goes, Eliot also does a fair job with the astonishing "Vertigo", adds depth to my reading of "The Man Who Knew Too Much", and takes a moment to appreciate a personal favorite, "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance."  Now for the cons:  Marc Eliot has apparently never met a convoluted sentence he did not use as-is.  Reading this book is an exercise in grammatical torture that absolutely cannot be blamed on printer's errors.  It is beyond shameful that his publisher let this book come out in its current state and his editor should be fired forthwith.  Every couple of pages the reader stumbles on a sentence in which the subject, verb and object seem to have been thrown in a blender with several commas and poured out like confetti.   Other reviewers have already mentioned factual errors, of which there are more than a few.  There is also a general feeling of sloppiness, as when "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" is called "Glory Hallelujah". (!!)  Then there is the lack of a consistent approach to the book, a theme to hang the story on.  Eliot simply cannot decide what kind of a biography he wants to write.  He frequently throws Stewart on the couch and gives him a thorough Freudian pummeling.  At other times he invokes film critics like Sarris to analyze Stewart's craft and the film landmarks he helped bring to life.  And then there are all the gossipy bits about Stewart and other stars.  All of these elements are to be expected in any artist's biography, but a good biographer picks one to give narrative structure, and lets the others add depth to the story.  Instead Eliot just veers wildly from one to the other, giving equal wieght to all.  And speaking of story, at times it seems that Eliot also can't decide whose wonderful life he's writing about.  Digressions abound, and are all given the same weight as the central story.  Frank Capra, Alfred Hitchcock, Anthony Mann, the Hollywood blacklist, Henry Fonda and other subjects are all important to Stewart's life.  Unfortunately they all are given equal billing.  Eliot devotes several pages to Frank Capra's life before Hollywood, to various aspects of the blacklist and to other topics, but often fails to show how this information relates to Stewart.  If a guy can't get top billing in his own biography.....  Oddly, the one person whose background story might have added to the narrative appears almost exclusively only in relation to Stewart.  Eliot makes a lot of Stewart's friendship with Henry Fonda, but never provides Fonda with much depth, and thus deprives both himself and the reader of yet another theme that could have enhanced our understanding of both of these complex, inner-directed, quintessentially American men.  In the end this biography fails becuase the reader is left not knowing much more about what Stewart thought or felt about his life or work than before reading the book.  In spite of the frequent appearance of the word "Oedipal" throughout, this is more of a map of a man's life than an actual visit to it.  I had high hopes for this book, as I am a huge fan of Stewart, whose most notable work has a breadth of characterization (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington to Vertigo to Harvey to Anthony Mann's psycho cowboys) and a nartualism that no one else has ever managed.  I hope someone will do him justice someday.  Until then, please rent the above-mentioned movies (and "The Philadelphia Story" , "Rear Window", "You Can't Take It With You" and, of course, "It's A Wonderful Life") and let the man speak for himself 
 Biggest waste of $35 I've ever seen ! This was a required text in school , and approximatly 25% of the formulas were completely unusable. It was if this character wrote these recipes off the top of his head without the  slightest concern for whether they worked or not.I shudder to think how  many copies of this waste of paper have been sold to culinary students and  the general public alike 
 What a lousy book.  I must have been daydreaming when I purchased it and missed the other review stating how utterly useless this book is.  Instruction like 'use a chain saw to notch the log so that it matches the other one' is not particularly inspiring or helpful for me.  And I too could have done without the government-bashing, build-a-cabin-in-the-woods-to-be-ready-for-WWIII message this person actually paid to publish.  I can't believe I spent any money on this thing 
 I purchased this commentary for an in-depth study that I was doing on Wednesday evenings.  I carefully checked a bunch of commentaries on Amazon, hoping to find the one that would help me with insights that I could share in the study.  Unfortunately, this volume hasn't lived up to my hopes.  I didn't need something that would offer the obvious points (I can do that myself).  I was hoping for something that would offer insights into some of the more difficult and confusing passages, including thoughts on how those passages apply to our lives today.  I've been disappointed.  I am now well into the study and rarely even check the book anymore as I'm gathering information.  I was between this one and the Carson commentary.  Obviously, I think I made the wrong decision.  (Not that there's anything theologically wrong in the text - it's just not what I was hoping for. 
 i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, "yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet" i just wished he'd flushed 
 I read Bergdorf Blondes earlier this summer and highly recommend it if you'd like to suspend reality for a few hours and get a girly, humorous dose of the high-maintenance lifestyle of a Manhattan socialite.  I certainly can't say the same for Debutante Divorcee - the story is far less engaging; the observations of manners, dress, and other details of society life are shallow and don't add much to the storytelling.  Worse, the characters evolve from boring to saccharine - and their respective stories are tied up at the end in a very unimaginative, deux ex machina sort of way that will leave you rolling your eyes.  Methinks PS could do better.  
 We bought a well-reviewed carpet vacuum from Amazon last year, and absolutely love it. After that positive experience, we were looking for something for our kitchen, bathroom and hallway floors and came upon this cleaner.  Starting with the dry vac part, that seems to get smallish pieces of dirt fine, but anything Cheerio sized or larger it pushes around on the floor unless you lean the vacuum back. Which would be fine, but if you lean it back too far, there is a suction filter thing (made for the wet vac part) that sticks and you have to turn off the vacuum and wait about 10 seconds for the suction to release that piece before you can continue. Anyway, the small dirt and dust are really picked up quite well, but if any of you have small children (we have 3 boys under 6), don't have any expectations of this getting up mealtime messes.  Now, onto the wet vac part, which was the main reason we got this. Very disappointing. We used the included cleaner, warm tap water, etc as the directions indicated, and both my wife and I swear the floor is no cleaner than when we started. It doesn't look cleaner, shine more or even have a nice smell that we could even close our eyes and pretend it was clean. Spills or stains that normally take 1-3 passes with a mop are taking 8-12 passes with this machine. We bought this to save time and/or get cleaner floors, and I can honestly say that this machine did not do either.  As briefly noted above, if you have children, do not expect clean floors out of this, and I can't recommend this at all. This product may be suitable for people who have no children, no pets and only small dust particles and light traffic; I just know this isn't our house 
 I've been confused by Michael Medved's position on film ever sinse he posed a question in the wall Street Journal asking "What happened to the missing moviegoers?".  He was speaking about the end of the Production Code (censorship) in Hollywood, and how that coincided with a drop off in movie attendance.    Yes--movies seriously changed in the late 60s, as filmmakers were allowed to depict subject matter previously forbidden.  I'm not sure what he is trying to prove here.  Everyone stopped going to the movies because of this?  So, it had nothing to do with attendance dropping since the mid-50s, with Vietnam, with the death of urban movie palaces and the total change of the movie going experience, the public's boredom with overblown "roadshow attractions" , with television?    No, actually, because in Mr. Medved's world you can trace anything and everything to a lack of morals.  He points out that the "Sound of Music" won best Picture in 1965, and then "Midnight Cowboy" (about a male hustler) won Best picture in 1969, thereby proving the decline and fall of western civilization.    So, I guess nevermind how many "family" movies of this time period ("Hello Dolly," "Doctor Dolittle", "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang," "Greatest Story Ever Told") were total and complete bombs at the box office.    He states that removal of the production code (remember, the decline and fall of western civilization) "hurt the bottom line." And apparently movies have just been utter "filth" ever since?  So, Christians would be hypocritical to own DVDs of the films that came out just after the removal of the Code, that could not have been made before it: "The Wild Bunch," "The Grauduate," "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," "The Producers," "Rosemary's Baby," "Midnight Cowboy," "Bonnie and Clyde."    All of those movies did great at the box office, by the way.  So I'm lost as to how the removal of the Production Code wrecked "the bottom line" in Hollywood.   Oh yes, one other thing:  Michael Medved did the glowing introduction to DeMille's "The Ten Commandments" at the Conservative Film Festival (or whatever its called) in 2004.    DeMille's 1932 film "The Sign of The Cross," jam-packed with violence, sexual perversion, [...]), helped contribute to the Catholic revolt against films, and the enforcement of the Code itself.  Some "scholar" you guys got here.  
 I found the beginning of this book difficult to get through. The ideas  didn't seem well thought out at first. The recommendations for research  were ancient. Once the author got into the "meat" of selling, the  book was much better. It has very sound advice for beginning sales reps in  regard to customer handling, objection handling, and asking open-ended  questions. A seasoned sales rep would find this book a waste of time. A  much better read is "Stop Telling, Start Selling" by Linda  Richardson or the "Guerrilla Selling" series by Jay Conrad  Levinson 
 IT WAS FREE WITH A GREAT MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS TOPPER SO, WHY COMPLAIN? NOT THE BEST FOR MY HEAD, HOWEVER, I NEED TO ELEVATE ME FEET WHEN LYING DOWN SO IT'S A COMFORT FOR THAT 
 Okay, let me explain the title.  I call this review Happy Birthday Mom because in the middle of the movie i stopped the movie to call my mom and wish her a happy birthday.  The typical thought would be that I bought this dvd for my mother as a birthday gift, but I do like my mom, so I wouldn't do that to her.  Later in the movie I also stopped it to talk to my friend that lives in Canada.  Yeah, I stopped it to talk to a CANADIAN, thats bad....  Well he's just up there for school, so ya know.  Some of it was good, but it could have done better.  I have the seemingly harder to come by skill of seperating fiction (movie, game, tv) from real life, so I like the kind of shat that upsets fragile people without that skill.  I'm sure some of the violence in this movie made someone cry foul....    And its gets and extra half star simply because Kari Wuhrer is hot in this movie, like every movie she's in! 
 Jacobs must have an excellent publicist because this book was the talk of the knitting community before it was even printed!  The Friday Night Knitting Club is the story of a group of women who get together and knit, except they never really do much knitting at the club meetings, and I never felt like I really knew the characters.  The character development was lame.  I think if Jacobs had put more effort into it, these could have been characters that we care about.  A better choice for a can't-put-it-down read about knitting is Debbie Macomber's "A Good Yarn" and even the teen-lit "Chicks with Sticks" series is better than this.  
 I just want to say, this book is BAD.  The characters have no change and/or development that doesn't make them meaner, cruder people, and the whole book is FAR too shapeless and confusing.  The main character is a boy  that goes against his parents' wishes to go to church, who eventually  cusses and has few associates.  His remarks against girls were unpleasant  to me as a female reader, and his desciption of Preacher Man was of a guy  who sweated and had freaky eyes.  Talk about pointless.  This book is a  disgrace to literature 
 It depends on what you want out of a book. Insubstantial hip?  Shallow characters that never learn a thing about themselves from beginning to end? Name dropping and cool toys? 
 The three-primary theory that Wilcox maligns in the introduction has been discredited for a hundred years.  But the system he expouses has been around even longer.  Much of the theory in the book is simply wrong.  http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/book3.html#wilcox 
 If you are interested in the film, you may have heard of it in comparison to the suprerior Lady Snowblood featuring Meiko Kaji or worked backwards from Tarantino's Kill Bill.  The main problem with this film and many Toei films of the 1970s is that it never delivers what it promises, action! In comparison to many other films of the this genre, in particular the Meiko Kaji films, it scores high marks for its aesthetics, design and camera work for those who are 1970s cult film buffs.  This movie has an incredibiliy ludricris plot a good sword fighting scene in the beginning, gratuitious boring sex scenes (Toei trademark here), and bad acting by supposed British actors. To compare this to Lady Snowblood is ridiculous. Save your money and buy the Scorpion series featuring Meiji Kaji, Lady Snowblood, its sequel and the Lone Wolf and Cub series for more coherent plots that delivers what this genre is all about: blood! I'd never thought a Japanese cult film could be as bad as a Italian cult flick until I bought this. 
 I PURCHASED THE Z5 FOR A WEEKEND HOME SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. MACHINE IS HARDLY USED.  MADE LUKEWARM COFFEE AND SLIGHTLY WARM MILK AND GENERALLY WAS A LEMON.  FINALLY RETURNED MACHINE AT MY PACKING EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY WHO RETURNED IT IN 4 DIFFERENT PIECES.  IT WAS COMPLETELY BROKEN.  THE BEST THAT THEY WILL DO IS SEND ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S REFURBISHED MACHINE IN EXCHANGE FOR THEM BREAKING THE MACHINE.  THIS SITUATION IS SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT IT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE.  MANY PEOPLE PAY LESS THAN $3200. FOR AN AUTOMOBILE(USED) AND GET BETTER SERVICE.  BUYER BEWARE.  THEIR EXCUSE WAS THAT THE MACHINE WAS 6 MONTHS OLD(BUT USED ONLY 10 TIMES).  I AM COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED WITH THE MACHINE AND THE COMPANY.  THEY WERE VERY RUDE AS WELL. HOPEFULLY AMAZON WILL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING BUT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN TO THAT POINT 
 This hardcore conservative did not enjoy this book.  The book is filled with a wealth of eye-opening information on significant people that I did not know but should (like Hugo Chavez's new best friend, Noam Chomsky), but the reading is so laborious and draining that I cannot recommend it.  It has none of the light-hearted fun that we often get from Rush Limbaugh.  Rather, it brought to mind the dark experience of listening alone to Michael Savage in a bad mood after dark.  The cheeky title is misleading - this was a joyless book to read 
 The book is like a bible. Explanation is more than needed and you loose thread while reading it. Topics are not as consistent and organized as they should be, you have to move back and forth to get the whole picture. In my openion the author is not clear in conveying his point. A point can be explained within few lines but insted he use far too much text. Topics are much more understandable with the help of examples though. Honestly I get bored! Overall, it is a fair book and can be used as refrence material 
 When will MTV learn? and when will anyone ever come to reality? Who in the world told this child that she could sing? She can't! Yes I agree totally with someone on this review the girl is just as nasally as I am when my sinusis are backed up. My cat can sing better then that...  Heck why not let me do a reality show you don't have to know how to sing all you need is just a pretty face. And that sums her up in a shampoo bottle.  She's young, pretty, petite, and talentless.  I say CAN Cheyenne! 
 This is not a 2 quart sauce pan, it is 2.5 quarts, exactly the same as the one that comes with the se 
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 If recipes like Fillet of Beef in Tomato, Caper, and Anchovy Sauce; Wild Mushroom Polenta with Thyme and Aged Goat Cheese; Pan-Sauteed Swordfish with Anchovies, Garlic and Tomato Fondue and Cappellini with Pan-Seared Calamari, Tomatoes, and Lemon sound like spur of the moment then this is the book for you.  Very little in this book looked as though I could just go to the kitchen and whip something up.  I will be donating this book to charity 
 First off...be aware.  Even though it isn't stated anywhere explicitly on the page, this item is PAN & SCAN.  That's what an aspect ratio of 1.33/1 means.  I missed that.  Second, the print is total crap.  It's completely grainy, and it looks like it was transferred from VHS.  Stay away and look for another version of this DVD 
 Man this movie was a disappointment on every level possible.  For years I've read all kinds of reviews talking about how this was full of freaky sex scenes, etc.  So I get an unrated copy and yea there's about 40 or so sex moments (not scenes) but every single one was as cornball and goofy as you can get.  Wow, some hairy dude in a Zorro suit is snapping his whip in front of an old wrinkled lady who's talking even though her lips aren't moving.  That's hot.  Or how about a woman painting flowers all over a naked guy then placing flowers in his thick terrifying public hair.  "Your bush is a flower."  Ahhhh!  Ahhhh!  Ahhhhh!  I would tell you about the plot but honestly it really doesn't matter, it's all just a lame excuse to show a whole bunch of people (who shouldn't get naked) naked.  Laura Gemser does have a kinda hot body, kinda.    That wacky coffee table makes me glad I wasn't alive in the 70's.   
 This book was written in 1993. While reviewing it, I noticed just how wrong the details are. Compare the details in this book to some of the brand name products. MANY are lower in fat, or calories, etc.   Foods change over the years. Believe me when I say, you want the most current and comprehensive reference when it comes to a food almanac.   Do not bother with this. It is now a paper weight, nothing more. There are better choices. Go to a local book store, peruse the many selections and select a CURRENT and comprehensive guide. Do not go for the CARB hype books. You need to know all the basics at the very least...protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sodium, and a guide that breaks down the types of fat would be the best...as long as it is current!! 
   once again, chomsky shows he is one of the most brilliant men alive! It's all America's fault! - the evils of capitalism! long live socialism! yet the man is able to publish the same book every six months and charge $14.95 for it BRILLIANT! from marxist to capitalist in one easy printing!  
 The author seems to have the need to applogize for the things he did as a rookie cop.  Sounds like a corrupt jerk that did not have the balls to be what any good LA cop is, HONEST!  This book is an uneducated joke of a look at actual police work in LA.  If the author feels so bad about the things he did, he needs to go down to the DA's office and tell them about it, or did he write it when the statute of limitations ran out.  You tarnish the badge for every good LA cop out there, just another whiny jerk that did not have any real respect on the street and within the divisions, no one I know knows this guy.  Must have worked West Valley.  Shame on you!  
 With the announcement of the "My friends and me" project I could hardly wait to own a copy of the CD.  At first this was supposed to be a double CD project including both male and female artists.  I guess project plans change and that I accept.  I recently received a copy this CD via Amazon and am terribly disappointed by the quality of the baking.  As one reviewer rightfully stated "it sounds like a Karaoke backtrack".  I also get the impression that the production of this project was done on the cheap side given the quality of the backing.  Although Dionne put a lot of faith in her son producing this CD I'm of the opinion that a more experienced producer should have taken the lead.  A full orchestra as backing would also do more justice to Dionne's voice.  I think however that the personal attack by some reviewers on Dionne's vocal ability is a bit unfair.  Take the vocals and back it up with a proper orchestra and you will hear the difference.  Unfortunately the terrible backing is so overpowering that one cannot help but cringe when you listen to the CD.  Should I recommend this CD to other people?  Well...  1) To Dionne all fans: Buy the CD, its certainly one of Dionne's poorer projects, however, you will always wonder if you should have bought it or not.  2) To people who do not mind Dionne's music but do not label themselves as fans: Rather purchase recordings of Dionne that dates back to the 80's, 90's and early 00's.  You will begin to appreciate this TITANIC of a talent much more.  The "My friends and me" CD might just do damage to casual listeners perception of Dionne.  3) To the new generation wanting to purchase their first Dionne album:  See point number two.  I not only purchased a copy for me but another one for a good friend as a Christmas gift.  I'm a bit embarrassed to give him a CD of this quality as a gift and rather decided to buy him something else instead.  I hope that Concord will take cognisance of the reviews and make the necessary changes when they start working on "My friends and me" 2 & 3.  Take Care  Riaan - South Africa 
 I ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive 
 What a disastrously bad and unfunny novel.  The self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny, the "plot" is see-through and cliched, and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog.  When people criticize chick lit, this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about.  It's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously, or stretches for a literary flourish, it's absolutely cringe-worthy.  I find it hard to believe the people who've praised it here actually read the same book.  This was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement.  She said she didn't really like it but thought it would be "more my kind of thing."  Obviously not a person who knows me well.  Thankfully, it doesn't appear the author is terribly prolific, so readers don't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing.  I wouldn't say it's one of the worst books I've read, but it's certainly one of the most useless 
 I never write reviews, but this one is a stinker worth commenting on. First thing out of the box and out from under the slip of paper that says "Guaranteeed Region Free", it rejected a video as out of region. I called the company and was walked through a process to "reset" it. Then the screen went completely blank/dead after about 45 minutes watching the first video. The only good comment I can make is the poor soul who works the phones at Cyberhome is a nice, helpful guy who doesn't try to talk you out of getting your money back. I'm sure he gets lots of practice. Don't waste your time with shipping and returning. Just don't buy it 
 Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud 
 I too wish I had read past the first reviewer. Must have been a born optimist!! The best thing about this book, THE PRICE. What a total waste of my time. I learned stringing beads as a toddler! I was looking for a GLASS BEAD BOOK and how to MAKE THEM. Why not put this book with the stringers! Shame on you Amazon for leading us down the wrong path. No wonder this book did not have pictures of the inside. shame shame shame! 
 I was disappointed with this book. It presents general overview of linguistics and language development that one can find in multiple other sources. There is no practical advise on raising children bilingually. Case studies illustrating possible scenarios are for the most part inapplicable and lack detail to be useful in practice. There are very few books that should go straight into recycling bin - and this is one of them.  
 yo, this is garbage for now and forever. How can another weak muthaf@#ker diss another weak mf. No limit is garbage, yo hear that LIL p. See your face soon in the headlines "Garbage Reviewer Found Slain;Choked with a tank Chain". Get it straight homeboy, go buy Qb finest, Prodigy, CNN and Nature. Learn what this rap game is about 
 I used this company since it said that it will ship in 2 days.  14 business days later it finally arrived.  When ordering school books with a due date, I will not use this company because it agrees to ship within 2 days 
 This book is a major disappointment. It begins with a story about Harriet Tubman and then leaves the reader to wonder what has happened.  The rest of the book is filled with anecdotes from various sources and refutes the  contention that this is one of the first books written about the role of  Black women during the slavery period..The book's weakest point comes when  she states that "both the black female slave and the planter's wife  were equally oppressed because they knew little of birth control"   this is feminist wishful thinking at its best..Another reviewer wrote that  "white males and their heterosexual patriarchy are to blame for the  maltreatment of slave women in the south"  I would urge her and  other's to read what many Southern women thought about their slaves.  It is  not the Pollyanna world of Sistahood between slaves and their white female  owner's that the author tries to portray..A cute book at best...... 
 I made an unfortunate selection in purchasing this storybook before a similar review (H. Hudson Aug 14) was posted. Had I waited I could have benefited from that review. Instead I must post a similar review. The most disappointing thing about this storybook is the CD does not let the child know when to turn the page. We also expected to hear familiar voices for Pooh and the gang rather than just a full narration. At this price there are much better selections if you are going to be turning the pages yourself 
 Reading D Virue's dialog on Indigo children seems to have a lot of misunderstood premises on Ms. Virtue's part. She brings in much of her own biases and dogmatic belief systems. Read this with an open mind so to see through the heavy belief systems of Ms. Virtue, as it contains some poignant truths about Indigos 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 Reader be advised that the author owns a consulting firm that applies Woody's proprietary model in making market forecasts and, needless to say, he's not giving out anything ... Interestingly enough, the author criticizes the use of quantitative models, but later attempts to measure the "mood" of the market to use it in a quantitative model ... ? One more comment: the average reader of business publications expects to find some logic in the style; this is not fiction, and using a "keep the reader guessing what the author REALLY means" is no business reading.  Did you take English 101 like the rest of us 
 You can tell this movie was released in 1998 because you can still see New York's Twin Towers standing, and because of the groveling incantations of "Islam is a religion of peace," repeated often enough (along with casting a Good Guy Arab Cop, Tony Shalhoub) to offset any PC-incorrect image of portraying Islamofascist terrorism.     A measure of how silly this movie appears from the rearview mirror of 2006 and all the ghastly Islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 is the first terrorist scene in the movie, where Denzel Washington as FBI agent tries, via megaphone, to talk the terrorists down from a hostage situation. He succeeds in getting the terrorists to let children exit the bus. Jihadis with a conscience -- now where have we ever seen this actually happen - Beslan (186 children killed)? London? Madrid? Mumbai? Only as old people start to exit the bus on a second appeal by Denzel does the bus blow up.   After a series of bombings in New York's supermarkets, movie theaters, restaurants, etc., pressure builds to call in the U.S. Army under martial law. Bruce Willis, the Army commander who is to take on this task, warns time and again that this isn't the proper role of the Army, but then, as one of the President's advisors explains in the movie, as if this is just one of those political things, the "President wants to appear presidential." Remember, this is 1998, and though critics of the movie, such as the New Yorker, refer to Willis's character as a "fascist U.S. Army general", the decision to grant him martial law authority would have been, ahem, none other than Bill Clinton. The movie slides by that little detail, however, to make it look like Willis, all on his own, is rounding up all able-bodied men of the Muslim persuasion (less draconian, by the way, than the rounding up of all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast by FDR, where the threat was less real and imminent than in this movie, but let's not talk about that, either; we're still in 1998, after all).  Of course, the CIA comes in for its usual whipping by Hollywood, where CIA agent Annette Bening has kept crucial facts to herself because she has personal scores to settle -- you see, she is the one who trained and armed some of these terrorists who are now running amok. Oh, yeah, sure, women-hating Al-Qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty Annette to train them!   But the best nonsense comes at the end: Denzel Washington and a handful of FBI agents rush into Army combat HQ and somehow surround Bruce Willis and pull their guns, saying he is under arrest for "violating the Constitution" (hey, why aren't they arresting the guy who ordered the martial law, Bill Clinton?). The general's clueless security detail also draws its guns, and there's a Mexican standoff. Denzel, using the same powers of persuasion that freed at least the kiddies from Islamofascist murder on the bus, appears to be succeeding in talking the Army soldiers out of using their guns to protect Willis. So Willis accepts the situation, allows himself to be arrested, and as the credits roll we see all these Army vehicles leaving Brooklyn in shame -- all it took was to bust the "fascist" general. Ta-dah!  So the movie, with a heap of literary license, proves at least one point at the end: back in the 1990s, it didn't take much for Bill Clinton to wuss out and avoid taking on the terrorists.  Meanwhile, some day, sooner or later, the idea of pre-emptive internment of Jihad-age Muslim men as a defensive measure will indeed catch on, if not here, then perhaps in France, the Netherlands, Russia, Israel -- it will be interesting to see who goes first. Because it is not just the Newtonian laws of physics that decree that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When they do the sequel to this preposterous movie in New York sans the World Trade Center, Willis will play the part of the hero, and whoever gets stuck with the FBI agent role will be the fool.   I give the movie two stars instead of one, because I would hate to discourage the making of such a sequel, and two, because any movie with Annette Bening in it automatically gets an extra star in my book 
 I borrowed this DVD from my local library, I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD, it looks like a crap video that is a shambles, The audio is reasonable in 5.1 plus the Doco is just ok, but the concert must be the worst vision I have seen on a DVD, How can David Bowie be happy with this visual display of inferior quality?, I get cheesed off with having good AV gear to have to  run this type of crap, and that's what it is, CRAP!! I have videos that come up 100% better, Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology? it"s not the first and it won't be the last, DVD producers please don't bother putting visual crap out on DVD, your transfers are unworthy of modern technology, if the Masters don't scrub up for transfer forget it, although a lot of people cant see any difference, so be it.  
 To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this book...  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't interested in a kiss and tell look into her life, but I have a feeling Tweed is much more interesting and entertaining than what this book suggests.  Most of the book covers her live moving from Canada to LA boucing from boring boyfriend to even duller boyfriend.  She finally meets Gene Simmons and she tells us how good there life is etc.  But she is obviously a hard worker, a survivor in LA movies, mixes with interesting people and is part of an intriguing relationship with Simmons - but there is little detail.  I found the "Family Jewels" DVD series far more satisfying and complimentary about her life.  For fans only.. 
 Not intuitive, have to use the book to figure out how to set it. It worked for the weekly test fine for several months and then stopped working. Battery backup is misleading, the duracells we put in must have charged and leaked while it was plugged in and we had to reset the thing numerous times. For the price this is pathetic. This is going in the trash and I won't be buying another product from Oregon Scientific again 
 I borrowed this book from the library, as I have been very hesitant to spend the money on Cat Who books lately.  This one has set the seal on it, though...I don't even want to read them any more.  Even Koko and Yum Yum have been made totally uninteresting.  This is a series which should have retired on a positive note because so many people enjoyed it.  Instead, the publisher has run it into the ground through sheer incompetence.  I hope there is some poor lowly soul at Putnam whose job it is to read customer feedback and pass it on to the fools in charge...maybe they will finally let this series rest in piece 
 You take a plastic CD, that you spent a good $ 15 on...you're anxious to hear the brutality that your teammates brag of towards this album while hitting the showers.  The open riff is pumping your adrenaline because it sounds like chaos is set to erupt...but instead of hearing a ferocious scream to welcome the evil you get a wimpy sounding " Bring it on " " Yea Boy"!  Yet your amazed! The mainstream follower is shocked!  Why? I'll tell you.  Because they don't know squatt about metal.  It's preppy mainstream excrament!  You'll hear positive reactions from the crowd that think Linkin Park and breaking benjamins are the future of metal!  The people that thought Follow the Leader was the 1st Korn album!  The people that think Godsmack is the music to pump up to before a football game, getting in a fight, or better yet being in the NAVY!  The people who only know these Slipknot songs " wait and bleed ", " Duality " and " Vemillon Pt.1". The people that thought Papa Roach was mosh music!  These are the lifestyles of the upscale who only get influenced by what is broadcasted on modern radio and is too afraid to observe what lies in the underground! I'm talking about a money destroyer! I'll admit myself the music on this album is hard hitting and got some groove.  But that Fred Durst is ruins it!  3 Dollar Bill Y'all ( although a corny title ) was an excellent album for what it is....Significant Other was fair for that time being but the more I listened to it, the more I despised it!  The more Fred Durst opened his mouth, the more I wished for his demise! He is the true definition of a sellout, a joke, and above all a talentless destroyer ( Like Kid Rock ).  If you want to jam to something with a hard hitting heavy sound with hip hop influence?  Get these albums: Hed(p.e.)-Broke Limp Bizkit- Three Dollar Bill Y'all Reveille Darwins Waiting Room Snot- Get Some Slipknot- Self titled EP Anthrax/Public Enemy any Rage Against the Machine or perhaps some old school Beastie Boys! 
 This is a high level overview of renovation with almost no useful details.  The author tries to address too many things and in doing so never goes into depth anywhere.  I bought the book to learn his take on cost estimation.  He spends 1/2 page giving ballpark numbers for an "average-sized house" and it is too high level and he leaves a bunch of stuff out.  If you know absolutely nothing about renovation then this book is a quick read and it might give you an idea of SOME of what there is to learn elsewhere.  If you don't know anything about renovation before you read this book and all you do is read this book, HIRE A GENERAL CONTRACTOR AND DON'T ATTEMPT THIS YOURSELF 
 I've been to strip clubs a lot, and this video just doesn't do much for me. The girls on here are very pretty, yet most of them don't display a lot of creativity in their acts. They can dance well enough, but with few exceptions their overall acts are relatively bland and unerotic. I was especially surprised that most of the girls strip immediately without any buildup of suspense. It's as though the contest was very rushed, so you're left feeling like you've seen just short clips of strip-tease acts. Now, a video of good-looking women dancing nude can't be all bad, but it can be done a lot better than this. Also, I'm not sure why this sometimes is said to be a 2-DVD set, but mine had only one in it. My favorite strip-tease video is "Sinsational Strippers," which is done with a lot more finesse and variety. 
 When I read the Constance Garnett translation of this novel 15 years ago, it became on of my favorites. But when I was reading the Larissa Volokhonsky, Richard Pevear translation I had trouble staying with the book for any length of time. So I switched to the David McDuff translation and I really began to enjoy the book again. I just think that Volokhonsky and Pevear don't write english very well. Frankly, there are frequent times when their translations make no sense at all. There was a big marketing effort behind the publications of their translations, and I bought into it. I liked the blurbs on the back covers, and tried reading some of their russian translations. But once I got into the habit of comparing translations, I saw that McDuff, Jessie Coulson, and others write much more readable translations.  These books aren't easy to get through; and I would hate to see someone discouraged by a poor translation. I recommend comparing one paragraph in two translations if you can. You'll notice the difference, and be able to pick out the translation that's right for you 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 I got the pedometer and from the start it DOES NOT WORK!!  You have to physically shake it for it to count a step!   I'm returning right away 
 It seems like a majority of reviewers are correct about this album. Just plain wack and trashy snap music to try to sell records. Now some people think that I'm from the south, so I'm supposed to like this type of music. Wrong!! The same people who gave us that single "White Tees" managed to sign to So So Def (Jermaine Dupri what did you do, sell your soul?), and recorded a sophomore album.   I guess anybody likes this kind of music, such as the reviewer below me who ironically is a top 1000 reviewer and resides in the same city as me, who claims they're on top of their game, and gave this 4 stars.  Now the album is just plain wack for the most parts. Horrible lyrics like "Watch your face beat up my hand" from the somewhat hit song "Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It" and the un creative repetative chorus on "B**** Stop Callin Me". Mostly the subject matter on this album is about drugs, cars, and going to clubs. Whoop-dee-do. I can just go on and on about how horrible this album is.  The guest appearances are horrible also. "Oh I Think The Like Me (remix)" is just as wack as the origonal. This time they bring in the So So Def Allstars (Da Brat, Bow Wow, and Jermaine Dupri) to help add to horrible song. The only good guest appearance is the Three 6 Mafia assisted "Don't Play With Me", and that is one of the better songs on this album.   Overall this album fails big time. Dem Franchize Boys did show an improvement- techinically. Their self titled debut was just plain stupid. This here is a level higher, classifing it as wack. On Top Of Our Game is basically classified as 'been there, done that' only in a less creative way. If this is the "top of their game" their game must not be very big. They did go platnum...in cell phone ringtones, so there is money being made somewhere. Ususally I don't buy albums, if I've already downloaded already, or know that it is going to be wack. I never would have listened to this if my cousin didn't leave this at my house. Hardcore Southern listeners will not like this review, those are the people I can highly recommend this to.  Lyrics: F+ Production: F Guest Appearances: D+ (gives a half star because of Three 6 Mafia) Musical Vibes: F- Overall: F  Favorite Tracks: Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It, Don't Play With M 
 sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded  or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more. 
 Out of 36 songs in this collection, only 3 are original recordings. The rest are new studio recordings - aka: Garbage! Don't waste your money on this junk! What a disappointment 
 First off, I'll begin by proclamating myself as a halo junkwad. Now that is out of the way, let's get to the review. I was completely fascinated with the rich textural world that Eric Nylund had developed in the first Halo novel, The Fall of Reach. It was quite creative and really helped you understand how the Master Chief ended up on Halo. The work was a near masterpiece, seriously. Then as my excitemnet leaped for the next installment, The Flood, I was slowly letdown, as page after page flipped. Don't get me wrong, the writer is talented and some parts like the introduction of the elite assasin Zammamee is very intriguing, along with his cohort, Yayap. Their stories and a few creative gems do pop up. However, the book reads as if you were narrating to yourself while playing the game. Seriously, this is how it goes for 90% of the book: The Master Chief flies his jumbled Banshee through another cavernous valley. He quickly sets down the craft and pulls his shotgun on two unsuspecting grunt workers who were sleeping on watch duty. The Chief quickly cocks his gun and splatters both of the imbeciles into mush meat.  Now imagine reading that over and over (with varying adjectives such as incinerates instead of splatters) for 300 of the 340 pages of the book. That's The Flood novel. I don't even blame Dietz for the monotony of the work. I just wish they stayed away from the game and filled in the niches, more background, and inbetween stories instead 
 If you are looking for a "feel good" book about baby boomer retirement, this book may have some value for you. But if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to, this book isn't the answer. Each segment-work, dreams, travel-is short and doesn't address many relevant issues. For example, regarding the work chapter, the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap. Well, that is speculative with globalism. Those jobs may be outsourced. Most are low paying. Many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining. Yes, there may be Wal-Mart jobs but is this your retirement dream? The work chapter sounds a lot like most "Do what you love" books. But doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income. These and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed. I could pick apart other chapters in the same manner 
 the dvd didn't work and returning it couldn't be more awkward so just cut my losses not happy in the slightes 
 Like others said the microphone stand broke very easily and the whole toy is not durable at all.  The legs and the stool do not stay together whatsoever.  My son has to sit with it on his lap to play it.  I would not recommend this toy to anyone 
 It looks great but the lace in the back itches so bad that I cannot wear it 
 Mexican food is absolutely sacred to me, and this book is a profanation.  I bought it after spending a year in mexico and wanting to recapture some of the tastes i came to love so much.  it was a big dissapointment.  I can understand how it might be a neat story that she went there not knowing spanish but that she still learned how to cook some things... however, her "outsiders perspective" comes across as irritating ignorance.  her methods are anecdotal (as oppossed to researched) and in her recipes and stories she manages to miss both the grace of high class mexican cuisine and the flair of mexicos bountiful street food culture.  diana kennedy and rick bayless (to name the two most famous) both have books in english that are more thoughtful and authoritative.  even a quick glance at one of these far superior books will expose ortiz's attempt as the exercise in vain superfulousness that it is 
 By "Inner Asia" is meant the area corresponding roughly to modern Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the Chinese province of Xinjiang. The history of this region is fascinating, and little known in the West. There is a clear need for books about it. Unfortunately, "A History of Inner Asia" does not meet this need. It purports to cover nearly 1400 years, from the emergence of Islam to the present, but this coverage is very unbalanced - about a third of the book is devoted to the last 100 years. The challenge of a history covering such a diverse and complex region is to weave the threads into a coherent account. The author has not met this challenge. A lot of detail has been amassed between the covers of this book, but writing good history requires more than amassing detail. Consequently, the book does not engage the reader's interest. The author displays a surprising failure of scholarship in his treatment of Chinese names. Instead of adopting the standard Pinyin transliterations, he uses an arbitrary mixture of transliterations, apparently at random. Mixed with Pinyin (Beijing, Xian) we find old Wade-Giles spellings (Hsi-Hsia, Hsuan-Tsang) and old British spellings derived from Cantonese pronunciation (Sinkiang). Sometimes the same Chinese character is represented in different ways on the same page! (Peiting, Beijing - the first syllable of both place-names is the Chinese character for "north"). Bei Lu is in Pinyin on page 266, but spelt "Peilu" in the index. Some of the transliterations do not follow any system; for example in Appendix 2, where the Chinese for "autonomous region" (zizhi qu, in pinyin) is rendered as "zeji chu". The author seems to have made it up, or possibly transliterated into the Latin alphabet from some Cyrillic transliteration 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 This book was useless as it was way too short...don't bother... 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 Why? This is a total waste of time and money on Disney's part. They just don't have that "magic" that they had in the 90's. I hope something happens because some of the animated movies are losing credibility. JMHO  
 I can't figure out which was worse - the acting, the dialogue, the direction or the plot.  I rented the movie thinking...."OK, a post WW2 spy thriller with Nazi intrigue starring Michael Caine and directed by John F.  How could it be anything but spine-tingling?". Jeesh, what a mistake.  Believe or not, Caine is capable of giving a bad performance.  And this was it.  He just seems lost in this train wreck.  However, he was Olivier compared the rest of the cast.  Veronica Tennant shows why her career lasted months!  All the others were caricatures of stereotypes (that Orchestra Conductor better be slinging hash somewhere now, because acting was not his forte).   And the dialogue!  Caine is supposed to be a "foreign born American citizen".  He, of course, has as thick an English accent as in every other movie, indicating he was brought up on the Isle.  When Veronica Tennant tells him "the umbrella is in the boot", she has to explain that boot means trunk in England!  Gawd, are we all idiots?!?  The plot?!?  Don't even get me started...  It's absolutely asinine.  Our bumbling everyman is caught up in some meandering travelogue which is supposed to pass for international high-stakes intrigue.  What a snorefest.   What were they thinking?    Nah, they weren't.  Pass on this one folks 
 After her mother's mysterious death in India, Gemma Doyle is sent to a boarding school in England. Gemma is troubled by her mother's death and the strange visions that she is receiving. At Spence Academy, she feels like an outsider until her magical powers manifest themselves in the ability to travel to another realm. Things unravel as Gemma has to separate evil from good.  This book is written in as a first-person-present-tense narrative, which makes it very awkward to read. The point of a novel is to tell a story, not to think it. Besides--who thinks in coherent sentences? There are several inconsistencies in the writing tense which should have been caught by the editor.   The characters are at times inconsistent. They seem more like girls of the 21st century than the 19th. The girls can't seem to make up there minds whether to be 'blushing maidens' or not. One minute they are blushing at the mere mention of the word "chastity", and the next they are joking about sex over a bottle of whiskey. The general behavior of the characters would have been more realistic if the setting had been the 20th or 21st century rather than the late Victorian era.   A weak point with this book is the magic itself. The sources are never fully explained, and suddenly finding Gemma flying up a staircase was disorienting. The idea was good, but all explanations were vague and confusing.  The entire novel is inconsistent and sensationalized. I felt as if Ms. Bray had created this novel then thrown in some corsets and etiquette to create a sort of modern, Victorian-Gothic, melodrama. The overall effect is weak and unsatisfying.  
 The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.  So this is just a warning.  If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.  
 This book has a fairly annoying layout which refers back to information not previously mentioned.  The examples are also fairly overly complex, there are much simpler ways to solving the problems.  Regardless, it was a required book 
 has anyone else noticed that there isnt a single nirvana song? of all of the bands of the 90s, nirvana was undoubtedly one of the more luminary bands. and yet they appear nowhere on this compilation. instead, we are treated to the worst of the consumerist, disposable pop trash the 90s had to offer. a retrospective album should do more to cover the diverse styles of music that were prevalent at this time, but this album falls short in every aspect. 
 Patrick Henry never actually defines what an "Ironic Christian"  is, but it basically seems to be a Christian who happily lives in  ambiguity, somewhere in the nether region that exists between total  skepticism and absolute certainty. So far, so good. Not everything can be  tied up in a neat little package like a TV show that ties up all loose ends  in one hour's time. The Christian life (even a life lived outside  Christianity) is full of surprises and wonder, and the fact that Dr. Seuss  can speak to a life of faith every bit as much as, say, St. Augustine, is  nothing new or shocking to me. Much of what Henry has to say in this book  is valuable as far as re-thinking many of our assumptions. But his embrace  of philosophies that are detrimental to Christian faith, such as radical  feminism (as characterized by his defense of the reprehensible  "Re-Imaging Conference") and religious pluralism makes me  hesitate to give whole-hearted approval of this book. If I have to be on  the left wing of Christianity to be an "Ironic Christian", I  guess I'm not one 
 This collection of "poems" is embarrassingly bad from beginning to end. Little more than notes, the stuff would not be published if it weren't Snyder. He has done nothing since the Beats, and did very little back then. Why bother publishing him at all 
 There are a lot of really bad books on portrait painting, and this is definitely one of them.  If Amazon was giving this book away, I would not want one.  There is really no instruction to speak of in this book.  The style is also pretty boring, and lifeless.  The type of uninspired, realism, and bad painting so typical of American Artist magazine.   Instead buy any of the Charles Reid books, but his Natural way to paint is the best for portrait painting.   ...Okay, maybe I have been a little harsh.  If you took this book, and stacked it up with some other bad art books, you could angle your watercolor board, and paint in the style of Charles Reid.  So, I guess it isn't worthless, just not very good 
 The advice he gives men and women is ludicrious.There again  working off sterotypes.No one in this day and age should be  told it's ok to have random sex.Of course he aims this at the male because it his warped mind only men go on a ramage after  a bad relationship.Women do too but it's left out of the book because as we all know he believes women are love starved  junkies only craving romantic attention and romance.He also believes,wrongly,that women are the most hurt,oh yes,that  self worth and waves coming again at the woman.He views women as somehow half a person without a relationship while a man can build up himself financially and socially,if not sexually after a break up.Women are the downtrodden in his view,the victims. Save the poor little women from themselves is what I hear coming from him.When it comes to men,he is right there ready for an ego boost saying,you can do it.He comes across as an over protective father with the women.He has some need to see women as needy,pathetic love junkies 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 Disclaimer:  I have only been able to sample Professor Butz's work.  I looked at those portions of particular interest to me.  I read what he had to say about Jewish demographics, that is, the number of Jews in Europe before and after the Second World War.  I also looked at what he had to say about the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, at which the Germans, according to the standard historians, decided on the Holocaust. I was also interested to see how he evaluated the Nuremberg trials of the top Nazi leaders.    On population figures, Professor Butz will not accept any data from Jewish or "Communist" (i.,e. Soviet) sources, since, he says, such sources are tainted.  Jews and Communist lie, according to Professor Butz, so why listen to them.  On the Wannsee Conference, he quotes the Nazi sources that speak of Nazi plans to deport all of Europe's Jews and to enslave them.  But since these Nazis did not spell out an intention to kill all Jews in so many words, Professor Butz finds that, therefore,  this source is reliable evidence for his proposition that no such killings took place.  In Professor Butz's book, moreover,  whoever says that he has witnessed the Holocaust is a liar.    On the Nuremberg trials, he finds that any incriminating statements by Nazis to have been extorted by cruel and sadistic Allied guards.  Professor Butz's work gives evidence of great industriousness.  He has many footnotes and supplies many figures and pictures.  Such apparatus has been taken as a sign of deep scholarship by his friends and supporters.  But his analysis of all these data is simple:  whatever supports his thesis is accepted, whatever contradicts it is called a lie.  But unfortunately for Professor Butz,  it is quite impossible to accept his thesis without also accepting his notion of the Jews.  He sees Jews of all stripes -- from the most Zionist to folks like Noam Chomsky -- as united in a vast conspiracy to dupe the non-Jewish world.  Moreover, in order to accept Professor Butz's work, we must also accept that this Jewish conspiracy, this "Hoax" as he calls it, was also uncritically accepted by all the professional historians who have worked in this area.  Everyone is a dupe, everyone, that is, except he himself and his handful of friends.    Is that plausible ?  I don't think so.  
 it's a little confusing to use and it's very easy to stop the wrong timer running because it doesn't automatically switch to the time going off.  But the worst is it's whisper quiet.  I bought this item for a professional bakery and the noise level is high.  If your running your home mixer and the timer goes off unless your right by it you won't here a thing.     
 I actually saw the advert for this work on Sean Hannity's home page - "The Turth about Hillary" (sic). The spelling probably tells you all you need to know about Mr H and the book. If you seriously wish to learn about real politics, the issues or US political system, this book will not be of use. If you believe that Elvis is still alive, then it is possible you may think it a worthwhile read.  It does however show the appalling state to which US politics has fallen. Most debate is at playground level and this book shows that in clear detail. Free speech is a privilege, not a right, and I will defend Mr Klein's privilege; but that does not mean that I think he is accurate or that I agree with him. I would ask if he would allow me the same courtesy? He certainly would not allow it of Mrs C 
 Jody Stephens thought Ken Stringfellow and Jon Aur would be good for a Big Star reunion.  Bad idea!  The two guys from The Posies make Big Star sound like fluff.  Big Star In Space ruins the reputation and legend of Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens.  There are better choices for musicians to become part of a Big Star reunion.  Alex and Jody should give the two posies the boot and start from scratch.  There is still a masterpiece Big Star album waiting to be written, recorded and released.  In Space is an embarrassment compared to the songs and musicianship of # 1 Record and Radio City.  Save your money and order vinyl copies of Big Stars early albums from Acoustic Sounds.  I got Radio City and # 1 Record on vinyl and they sound incredible.  
 Office 2007 may seem ok at first.  The menus are all ok for me to use, so I don't have to build menus from scratch.  But after installing the trial, I found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if I had it.  1)  Word doesn't want to integrate with Outlook very well 2)  Everytime I want to send a mail message I accidentally click on 'Paste' 3)  The flags and categories for Outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than Outlook 2003 4)  Along with all of the other Microsoft products I've tried in the past month, it hangs, corrupts its own files, and generally takes up too much memory.  I'll stick with Office 2003, which doesn't have nearly as many flaws.  There is no reason for me to upgrade.  I'm also back to IE6, Money 2006, and will not upgrade to Vista.  I've lost volumes of emails because I can't downgrade my Outlook files.  Good Job in alienating your customers, Microsoft.  (so what's new? 
 If you are in the market for a romantic lesbian love story -this is not the movie to look to.  The movie is 1 hour and 34 minutes long and I couldn't wait for it to be over!  I love Lilly Taylor -she was amazing in Mystic Pizza, Who Shot Andy Warhol, Dog Fight, and most recently made a special run during the last days of Six Feet Under.  As a Lilly Taylor fan you will be sorely disappointed that she chose this role.  This story is about a woman who wants more out of life, but the script is so far fetched in how this transition unfolds.  She goes from minimal, menial high school drop out to physicist student extraordinaire in what seems like the span of a semester or two.  Granted, the time table could have been better in this film, but that's only a very small part of it.  Every single character in this movie is obnoxious and hard to like with the exception of Taylor.  Her husband starts off a sexist, chauvinist and ends the film in much the same way you would just like buy him a clue.  Her children are bratty and always shouting they can't leave the room or scene quick enough.  Her love interest is Courtney Love, and while I love her too -even of late with all of her bad press she's not likeable either.  Courtney Love is probably the worst of them all.  Her character is afraid of change, afraid of being true to herself, worries too much about what other people think of her, wants to be accepted at the cost of herself, and as a result runs back to what is familiar to her and in the end it's okay with her.  The only redeeming quality in the movie Julie Johnson is that Julie Johnson did not want to go back to the kind of woman she was before her awakening.  She never lost her girlish vulnerability throughout the movie, and although cautiously and at times timidly eventually embraced the changes of her new life with admirable, quiet strength.  
 The book started with a bang and ended with a whimper. It was tedious reading by and large, as the Park System is viewed by kind of the Willie Loman of Rangers. He also, as is common in this day, blames all the world's ills on America's and particularly George Bush's failure to get with the program and turn America into a socialist paradise. Like Cuba, I guess.   He spent twenty years with his co-workers, but has about as much insight, overt compassion, and intimacy with them as I have with the people I wait for the bus with. I'd really have to suggest skipping this depressing and needlessly politicized book; the ramblings of an embittered man. It reminded me of a poor-man's "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", only more pointless and far less well written 
 If you are not  an IT person you will need help setting  up .Using D-Link customer service is a chore due to language issues .I bought the video phone to contact my son in Taiwan and it never would connect ==D-Link HELP LINE ?? ==could not understand why and were  of no  help  what so ever .I could reach the test location but that was it .=Complete waste of money !! 
 I was reading about my son.  It all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense.  Really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. Then half way the book screeched in a new direction.  All of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view.  When it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to take that one back, which weakens the premise they present.  The authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position - which I would have respected, if not agreed with.  Then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes Christ into the conversation/solution.  If I knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system, I wouldn't have spent the $22.  I would have wanted to know that in advance.  Tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book.  Buyer Bewar 
 The last line of my review comes first:  If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.  And now the review:  I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time.  And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.  The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.  This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor.  The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel.  The characters are all church characters.  And the god is not so godly.  Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.  Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly: (last line of the review 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 I am not any kind of sanskrit scholar but I have enjoyed reading mythological literature for about ten years and I found Buck's Mahabharata to be a bore. I found it incomprehensible and disjointed. It was as if the author was trying really hard to create such an air of enchantment that he gave us something that sounded downright obscure and pretentious. At first I thought that maybe the original is this way, but then I came across R.K.Narayan's crystal clear version. After that I read Rajagopalachari's, which was beautiful. I recommend these versions much more 
  		Richard Pipes's Property and Freedom, offered by him as the work of a "dilettante", is professor emeritus of Russian and Soviet history at Harvard. He is the author of at least twelve other books, including A Concise History of the Russian Revolution (1995) and The Unknown Lenin (1996). His books are written in an agreeable prose, a passport across any boundary, but one. In conscience, Property and Freedom cannot be recommended except, perhaps, to someone who is dying of incurable boredom and needs a dose of it to go over the side, for rare is the person who can read this book without slumping over it, and wise is the person who does not read it in front of an open fire. As the great 19th century historian Jacob Burckhardt wrote, it is good for a specialist to be a dilettante in other fields, but he should be one "privately" (Burckhardt, Weltgeschichtliche Betrachtungen (Munich, 1978), 16). Pipes instead chose to write a book. 		Pipes wrote Poverty and Freedom to prove that liberty and the right to property are "connected", an idea that emerged in the seventeenth century and that no one contests. He claims, however, that though the idea is old, the historical evidence for this uncontested idea has not been gathered, and hence his book. It is doubtful that, after reading it, the reader will learn what he did not know at the beginning, and that is that rights have not "evolved" in a Darwinian garden, they are not sociobiological specimens, and they are not the result of theological epiphanies. They are powers that have been granted or seized because those who would deny them would suffer. All else - tracts, scrolls, philosophies, testaments, beliefs religious or pagan, all of the scenery and scripts that we call history, are as nothing compared with the central fact of power and its location. Magna Carta, for example, benefitted English barons, not Englishmen at large, and freedom of speech originated not in the mouth of an English divine or philosopher but in the grant of the English crown driven by the need of money to grant them to the House of Commons. 			For the history of the idea of property, Pipes recounts the thinking of Western philosophers, theologians, and political theorists. We are treated to the differing views of Plato and Aristotle, the influence of Stoicism on Christianity, the immense contribution of Roman jurists, the radical opinions of St Thomas Aquinas, the inspiriting of capitalism by Calvin, the derisable ideas of the "noble savage" and "Utopia", and on and on through the Law of Nature, Grotius, Hobbes, Harrington, Locke, Rousseau, and the calling in, of all people, Wordsworth and Coleridge, all of this and one has reached only page 49, with last-page 328 a rumored oasis in the distance, reachable after one has run barefoot over 907 footnotes in which one's closing eyes may find six languages to feast upon. If this book has one constant flaw, it is its daunting incantation of facts and opinions that fly by like freight trains, all to prove that the right to property is essential to liberty. The flaw may be forgivable on the ground that Pipes, a Polish Jew who fled Poland in 1940 at the age of ten, has for decades lived intellectually with the murderous sweep of Marxist Communism, fixed at 20,000,000 under Stalin, and 120,000,000 throughout the earth (See, Stephane Courtois et al., Le livre noir du communisme (Paris: Laffont, 1997)).  		For property as an institution, Pipes examines history, psychology, anthropology, and sociobiology, to prove to us, a people consecrated to materialism, that acquisitiveness is universal among humans as well as animals. He covers possessiveness in animals, including insects, from protozoa to primates, careful to include dragonflies and the beloved three-spined stickleback. At one point he writes, "Such examples can be multiplied ad infinitum", causing this reviewer to reflexively drop his book. Nor does the acquisitive behavior of children escape Pipes's cascade of what must be thousands of 4 by 6 index cards. Following children, presumably in logical progression, are "possession among primitive peoples" and "societies of hunters and gatherers". The myth of a primitive communism is bound and taken to the scaffold, while private property in antiquity, feudal and mediaeval times, is reported, together with the creation of the state as the guarantor of ownership. 		Pipe points to England as the classic illustration of how private wealth came to restrain public authority. Parliament, the servant of the crown from the 11th to the 15th century, then its partner from the 16th to the early 17th century, became the crown's master in the 1640's. The secret, described by Pipe in  habitual detail, was simple. The crown needed money. The "people" had it or controlled it and demanded freedoms and reforms for it. He traces English history from pre-Norman times through the development of the common law, the crucial history of English taxation, the history of the Tudors, Stuarts, the Commonwealth, and the Revolution of 1688.     		By way of comparison to England's history, the story of patrimonial Russia, including two and a half centuries of serfdom and seventy years of Communist rule during the latter of which Russians were deprived of liberties to a degree hitherto unknown on earth, is painstakingly set forth in proof of how the absence of the right of property makes tyrannical government possible. Like its predecessors, this chapter sorely needed surgery. It is overloaded with historical material that satisfies only a narrow scholarly interest. Still, there are matters that might engage the reader, particularly Pipes's development of the idea that Russians historically saw sovereign power as the source out of which property issued, and the fact that Russian liberals under the Tsar saw law as the cornerstone of liberty but did not see the connection between law and private property. 		In Pipes's last chapter, he tours our welfare capitalist state, complaining that entitlements create dependence, environmental laws are oppressive, minimum wage laws interfere with freedom of contract, banks are pressured into minority loans, rent control is bad economics, administrative agencies are governmental islands broken away from the continental shelf, taxation of personal income unjustly redistributes wealth, affirmative action in employment is the most egregious form of governmental interference, the government takes property by regulating its use, and so on, providing a communal table at which readers of this review  at this moment are selecting their favorite complaints. 	 Pipes's book invites criticism, but there is in this his last chapter a sudden, disarming admission.  A way, he writes, must be found to preserve property as a fundamental human right while, at the same time, "ensuring fundamental social justice". Had Pipes but written a slim, creative volume on social justice in a capitalist state, he might have given us something worth fifty books on the connection between property and freedom. The way to preserve the right to property and to assure social justice, he argues, is mainly "by attitudes which determine how laws and institutions are employed." This reviewer would put it another way. On the one hand, welfare capitalism offers the best opportunity for realizing freedom and achieving productivity while assuring minimum benefits to those least fortunate. On the other hand, working and middle class majorities may demand too much equality with the rich, thus impairing the prospect of long term economic productivity and giving too little equality to the underprivileged to satisfy their right to human development. Thus, the justice of welfare capitalism depends on the virtue of moderation by all classes for the sake of the common good. Imperfect as the analogy may be, it is somewhat like one ship towing another at sea. The knack is to keep both ships "in step" by using a tow line of such a length that the ships meet the waves and ride over them together, otherwise one vessel might be in a trough while the other is on a crest, causing the line to slacken and then tauten with sudden violence, doing neither much good. So too in welfare capitalism. The expectations of the classes must be such that one does not destroy the other, otherwise they will all go down. 			   
 Seeing what's become of the rock and roll legends I remember from when we were much younger, I found very depressing. I'd rather remember them the way they were 40 yrs ago. Even Jerry Lee looked like he was ready for the nursing home 
 This appeared verbatim in the magazine THUNDER PRESS.  BTW, Zimberoff's next book (out next spring), a continuation and sequel to ART OF THE CHOPPER is dedictaed to INDIAN LARRY and contains a full chapter of his work, a portrait and his biography plus every other major builder on the planet.  Reviewed by Terry Roorda  QUOTE  Dated photos gleaned from the collection of photographer Michael Lichter combine with perfunctory prose by writer Mike Seate to bring us "Choppers: Heavy Metal Art," a shameless effort to cash in on the current chopper craze by using the exact format found in the highly acclaimed and successful "Art of the Chopper" by Tom Zimberoff. That's it in nutshell, folks. The similarities in physical size, style and content between this work and Zimberoff's are striking to say the very least: A fat highly- produced coffee table book that examines a roster of custom bike builders through portraiture, some biographical verbiage and studio photos of some of their creations.  That's where the similarities end. In the execution of that formula, Zimberoff's "Art of the Chopper" is fresh and literate while "Choppers: Heavy Metal Art" is stale and sophomoric. Seate's writing is lackluster at its best and painfully awkward most of the time, reading like the first draft of a work being produced on contract and on deadline. In three of the early vignettes in the book we are informed that "Colorado's Arlin Fatland has what you might call a wicked sense of humor," and that "Pat Kennedy of Tombstone, Arizona, is what you might call seriously old school," and that "Nothing about Kodlin's motorcycles is what you might call tradition- al." These excerpts are what you might call bad writing; the type of tedious template prose so devoid of creativity and enthusiasm for the subject matter that any editor worth the name would kick it back in disgust and demand another go. That's assuming there was an editor involved at all, and judging from the wealth of typos and awkward usages found in this book, there's little reason to believe there was. A truly ironic typo comes early in the going when in Seate's acknowledgments he pens this gem: "to Almetta, for never letting us forget the value of the wirtten word." Yes, folks, it says "wirtten." How's that for value?  Here's some other stuff that made me wince: "Looking like a cross between a scene from a concert by gangsta rappers Insane Clown Posse and a Felliniesque circus nightmare, Johnson's paint schemes grab a viewer's attention and hold it rapt for hours." Hunh? Or how about this stinker: "These self-anointed keepers of the hardtail faith congregate in Internet chat rooms and in the letters pages of custom motorcycle-enthusiast magazines to heap dis and envy on builders who aren't afraid to move the art of the custom motorcycle into the twenty-first century." Ouch.  There's plenty more where those came from. And the tragic thing about it is that Mike Seate is usually a competent and entertaining writer-and probably the most prolific wordsmith in the genre. Therein may lie the problem. This volume represents Seate's fifth book with the word "chopper" in the title, and four of those, including this one, were published in the span of less than a year and a half. Who wouldn't get burned out? The upside of "Choppers: Heavy Metal Art" are the images furnished by renowned biker photographer Michael Lichter, a man with one of the most impressive resumés in the industry. As always, his photos are luminous, and anyone familiar with his work in Easyriders magazine over the past couple of decades will recognize his style, but there's a problem here as well. These photos apparently came straight out of his existing inventory of bike feature shots, and many were taken years ago, going back as far as 1992. When you're making the case for custom bike building being a vibrant and dynamic craft in an exciting period of change, growth and popularity, wouldn't you want the timeliest material you could bring to the premise? Other complaints in this regard are that the names of the featured bikes are not provided, though they're often referred to in the copy, and the sparse technical data given for each consists only of frame style (rigid; Softail- type) and engine style (Panhead; Evolution-type), which are obvious attributes to anyone the least bit familiar with the subject, and of little or no educational value to those who aren't. Those criticisms aside, we have to understand that doing this book right would have taken some time, and clearly the publisher wanted to get into the market before Christmas with a product that would hopefully piggy- back on the success of "Art of the Chopper." That's understandable, if not admirable, from a business stand- point. From a creative standpoint it's disastrous. END QUOT 
 come on jerry.. i am probably your biggest fan and even when i bitch about everything, i am not an iota bitter about your billion dollars but this book is just a print out from a few web pages pinned together 
 Unfortunately the DVD I received was a region 1 DVD, and could not be played i Denmark, which I informed you about, and after som exchanges of mail you very kindly arranged a refund to my account of the purchase price and I have bought the same DVD from another source, although I probably could have bought a usable DVD from Amazon in the UK, but this information was never relayed to me. I only have to live with the cost of importing the DVD into Denmark, about the purchase value of the DVD, but every experience costs money, normally. So thank you for your service in this matter. Best regards Peter Daugbjer 
 This book just drags on and on.  Buck's search for Chloe could have been handled in a fraction of the time.  One huge gripe, which represents incredibly poor writing, is the name changes used to refer to one character.  Ken Ritz is both referred to as Ken and Ritz, and not just in dialogue either.  One rule of good writing is to ALWAYS refer to your character by one name.  You wouldn't refer to a mother as Jane, mum, mother and ma in the one book.  Still, the book can be quite entertaining if you know what's coming next, which you would because it's been mentioned enough in the books.  One more thing that bothers me is recapping on past events-- the authors rehash the same old stuff 
 I have a working copy of this book that was given to me while taking the product design course at the University of Texas.  The book would probably be a lot better if it had a good index, but since it was thrown together to give the class something to read, it doesn't.  I didn't use the book much for class, but have used it some since then.  This book uses design tools that are good in theory, but sometimes take too long to actually be used in a real situation (i.e. QFD) 
 I did not enjoy or understand this strange tale. Perhaps a reader's guide should accompany it. I do, however, treasure The Collected Stories Of Eudora Welty 
 Like many readers, I adored Morvan Fitzwaryn in Ian & Reyna's book, but he turned out to be less than perfect here.  He was kind of jerk, actually.  My main problem with this book was that Morvan was not humble or appreciative of everything that just fell into his lap; it was more like - he wanted it, he should have it 
 Richard Haass attempts to distinguish himself from the neocons. Aside from form, however, the substance really isn't any different. Both begin with the assumption that American Imperium is a requirement for peace and prosperity and any real deviation means *global* catastrophe. Any suggestion that American Imperium itself is the problem is simply beyond the pale, and is dismissed by all sides of american foreign policy elite (neocons and neorealists) as "unserious" or worse. Neocons and neorealists are 2 sides of the same coin. The "argument" between them is kabuki theater. A pointless handwringing melodrama, signifying little and meaning even less. At their core, both are motivated by a proconsul's view of the world where the only future of humanity worth living is one where america's elite, and the children of america's elite, are the one's calling the shots.   It's not a view shared by the rest of the world 
 Suzanne Somers apparently has no use for modern medical science. Especially as a survivor of breast cancer (although of a very early stage) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones. Recent studies have shown that women who were taking HRT for protection from heart problems actually had MORE problems than normal menopausal women. This is an unbelievably destructive, horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously. Being skinny is NOT more important than being alive. If you want to get the real scoop on hormones, talk to a doctor at an academic medical center (in other words, one that isn't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain) and see what she or he has to say. Chances are excellent that you'll be told to avoid them at all cost. Look at it this way: are you going to put your very life in the hands of Suzanne Somers? I'm sure she's a very nice person; it's just that she has no medical training whatsoever. *** writing from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center** 
 Hey Noam, I was wondering if it worked the other way too?  If you tell enough lies about things, manufacture evidence, cite sources that are dubious at best and then sell them to your unwitting disciples do you manufacture dissent for the things that get in the way of your political ideology like truth, facts, common sense, and reality?   A falsehood well footnoted is still a falsehood.  Anyone that reads Noam Chomsky should also read the Anti-Chomsky Reader.  This man is an extremist political ideologue that is hell bent on spreading his anti-American and anti-Israeli hate messages.  Noam's motto is if you manufacture a lie and tell it in countless boring pseudo books enough times people will believe it.  Sorry Noam I took a pill called reality when I was growing up and it immunized me from the likes of you, Michael Moore and whoever else sells your drivel.  While you Rage against the Machine, I and others like me, Rage against the Morons.  For those of you that blindly utter that Chomsky is the most cited reference on the planet I counter that McDonalds is the worlds largest restaurant on the planet.  Over indulgence in one can lead to poor physical health, sampling at any level in the other leads to disastrous results in one's mental health.  Like smoking, there is no safe level of exposure to Noam.  At least McDonalds can claim that their products taste good.  Neither's claim is generally a good reflection on society as a whole.  I was just wondering about this statistic's validity.  Is this scientifically documented or is it pop myth like everything else Chomsky writes.  Does the statistic include Chomsky citing his own opinions from one book and then presenting them as established facts in another?  Noam would interview 1000 people that witnessed an event. If 999 said things happened one way with only one dissenter Noam would discount, ignore, or attack the 999 and present the 1 as the established version if it fit with Noam's agenda. 
 This is a compendium of several articles. Haught makes the same argument over and over again - that God loves the world so much that he is willing to leave it alone to determine it's own destiny. He offers little in the way of evidence of this assertion. It's an interesting idea, but it doesn't need an entire book - the first one or two chapters make the point 
 I love Journey, but only with Steve Perry!  Yes, Journey was around before Steve Perry but S.P. had that special magic and the band was a huge success.  Steve A. tries to sound like Perry but it can't be done.  They haven't made it really big with Steve A.  Van Halen had two different lead singers and they were both totally different from one another.  Their voices were different, their style of songs were different, their image was different and Van Halen was so popular with both lead singers. It is totally fine if a band wants to get another lead singer, just don't try to sound like the previous one by voice or style of music.  Steve Perry had the whole package.  His stage presence was awesome and his voice is the greatest.  You really don't hear about the (new) Journey with Steve A.  You don't really hear them on the radio, see them on t.v. or anything!! Steve Perry was the best and if he would ever go back with the band, they'd be a hit all over again.  I didn't like this CD at all.  None of the songs made an impact on me.  
 This cd is, without a doubt amazing.  Stars are lost because prior to recording, you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn NOISE GATE for his guitar rig.  His tone is crushing & sounds perfect, but the second he stops playing, every time SSSSQQQQQQUUUUEEEAAAALLLLL.  It's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once, because it is a chronic problem in every song. 
 ...to dieting and to writing. As a previous reviewer alluded to, this book would have been much better had Dr. Atkins been able to finish himself. However, what we are left with is a co-author MD who's personality is as cold as ice; not to mention condescending and disrespectful.  This shines through in the tone of the writing. Furthermore, how can we take diet advice from someone who is obese herself? There are plenty of other well-written low-carb diet books.  Try another 
 I had to read this book for school this week. The first 20 - 30 pages were very slow and boring. In the end, the book was a slight more interesting. I would not recommend this book to my peers. I did not enjoy reading A Gathering of Days.  Some of my ideas of how the author could have made this book less boring: 1. Added more suspenseful climaxes 2. Taken out unimportant information 3. Wrote this book in regular format, not journal format 4. Used better word choices throughout the context of the book 
 After a few chapters, it became a chore to finish this book.  I prefer hard sci fi novels, and I only found about a third of these short stories to be interesting. Many of the stories had too much fantasy for my tastes.  Of the few stories that I did enjoy such as those by Baxter and McAuley, they really were too short on details and elaboration, but I did get a taste of the authors' styles and I think it is worthwhile to see what other novels they may have written 
 I really enjoyed Bones of the Master, but I regret to say that this book is awful. It reads like a 16 year old's diary--unbearably self-centered and self-absorbed, given to inane philosophizing and adolescent romanticism. It is somewhat astonishing that a sixty-something year old man has managed to abide at such a stage of arrested development. He may have inadvertently succeeded in his quest for literary recognition by writing what will one day be considered the definitive document of baby boomer narcissism and selfishness. I suppose it was the presence of Tsung Tsai that made Bones of the Master engaging, because without it the author is adrift 
 For the few examples of exponential growth, most notably Moore's Law, there are 10 (battery life, transportation speed, food production per acre, life span, etc) of areas that we have devoted a great deal of effort towards improving without exponential returns.  While this book presents some interesting points it is little more than psuedo science.  Perhaps Kurzweil's most important conclusion, that we are nothing more than biological computers, is the most scary.  The conclusion of this, that he does not raise, is that there is no free will.  Maybe he is correct, I doubt it though 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL

 I bought this book hoping for clues to help my high school students.  It didn't happen. This book would be a good choice for college instructors.  
 These DVDs are "Laserlight" releases which mean that they have very poor quality picture and sound.Wait for the new Hitchcock Box sets which have clear picture and sound plus documentaries and other extras.The superb Criterion versions are also a good choice.If it's introduced by Tony Curtis,then it's Laserlight,avoid it 
 Took me forever to get through, slow and difficult to follo 
 The Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous.  The handle is much too small for this size mug.  If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware.  The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves.    Fiestaware really screwed up on this one, a shame given the beauty of the Scarlet Fiestaware 
 I was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack. They are rated at 2000 mAh, but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames. My 2 year old Panasonic 1600 mAh in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots. I tried these batteries in my MP3 player - and even there, it won't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback. It is not that the battery does not hold any charge - that it has. But it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices. It seems to be all right for use in a flashlight. A set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight (a bit dimly) for hours (yeah - I tested it). For the test, I had  charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration (it is not a charger issue). I plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but rip-offs. One last tip - nowadays, the best NiMH batteries are made by Sanyo. It is better to pay 2 - 4 times for them than for a Lenmar. Trust me 
 I went to the school in the Milwaukee that Sacred Hearts Holy Angels is based on. It is also the school that the author attended and while many of the things are true about the white dinner, partying, and though there were some of those sex driven gals there, there were many things that just didn't fit. Yes, this is fiction, but even being fiction, it was poorly written and mocks fine literature. I agree with another reviewer of this book... if she had only paid attention to Mr. Grandy's lectures!! 
 Goldwater's disastorous 1964 Presidential campaign is the vehicle for telling the book's real story: the rise of the ultra-conservative movement in American politics in the sixties. It is undoubtedly an important story, and one that Perlstein has researched considerably. However, Perlstein's work is undone not by his findings, or his damaging portrayal of the burgeoning right-wing movement -- I concur with him on these points -- but by very lazy presentation. Perlstein has obvioulsy drunk deep at the David Halberstam well. He can rattle off an anecdote, but he is dreadfully prolix. The book is at least two hundred pages too long. No reader opening a book on sixties politics needs an eight-hundred word summary of Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. Perlstein has also made a mess in organising his material; he leaps back and forth, from person to person, without ever stitching the requisite parts together. One moment Henry Cabot Lodge looks to be the certain favourite for the 1964 Republican nomination, and we are treated to fifteen pages on the organisation of his campaign; later we are told, almost as an aside, that he has withdrawn from the race, and Perlstein never explains why. Sam Tannehaus's 'Whittaker Chambers' is a much more assured analysis of the growth of anti-communist hysteria in the fifties and sixites, and is considerably shorter and better crafted than Perlstein's book. A more thorough editor and an author more intent on telling the story carefully and well would have made 'Before the Storm' a much better book than it is 
 I was 4 years old when this movie was released, but I vividly remember Irene Cara's smash song of the same name in 1980 (especially the chorus of, "Fame, I'm gonna live forever") and, after so many years, I was really looking forward to a great movie and boy was I disappointed.  I was thoroughly bored during the first half-hour.  The audition sequence should have been cut down by half the time because it got boring after 15 minutes.  After this painful sequence, the movie finally gets underway.  I tried to stick with the movie for the next hour and couldn't do it.  I appreciated what the teachers had to say about the performing arts (it IS hard work - everybody's an actor, dancer, and/or musician but only a very small percentage actually make a living doing it), and I definitely appreciated the part about having to keep up your academic studies while pursuing a career in entertainment, but the movie just didn't flow for me.  Perhaps it would have to do with the fact that I'm not one of those people who isn't proclaiming to anyone who'll listen that I'm an "actress" (and who rolls their eyes at those people who do).  Besides the slow pace of the story, "Fame" is very dated.  The off-the-shoulder top (that became the rage of the early-80s due to Cara's video) and the depressed backdrop of the decaying inner city that characterized that "wonderful" decade known as the 1980s gives a potential viewer the incentive to stay away from this movie.  I don't get the hype about this film at all.  - Donna Di Giacom 
 This is a fantastic book for those people who are slowly losing their grip on reality. While some of the basic underlying concepts are good I don't find myself practically applying the concept of psychic prisons to my organisation, nor do I view my staff as ameobas that make up a large organism. I have to admit though that I know of others who found the paradyme of organisations as instruments of domination highly arousing 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 I don't understand the motivation of authors that claim the USS Liberty attack was anything but accidental. Sure they'll get some sales from the neo-Nazi conspiracy nuts, but isn't being honest more important?  In short this book still can't answer the $64,000 question of why ISrael would purposely attack their ONLY ally in 1967.  If this friendly fire incident were something else, the US would not have begun giving military aid to Israel, (they started this policy in 1968) Israel and the United States are 2 of a kind, they have the courage to fight terrorism, and this book is simply making up a conspiracy that never happened.  Don't quit your day job Anthony Pearson, whatever it is 
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 There are much better books on management out there than this collection of unorganized work.  Don't read this book if you're looking for new insight on management techniques.  If you're already a seasoned manager, you'll find more value in your real work environment.  This was a text for one of my MBA courses, and the rest of my MBA team (which consists of seasoned management professionals) has the same sentiments.  Spend your time elsewhere. 
 Albeit the fact that Zig Ziglar's own MLM bit the dust, this book is great for those who would like to learn how to retail their MLM products.    Also this book does NOT cover much about the pitfalls one is bound to encounter in network marketing.

 I bought this movie for Casper Van Dien and Kim Cattrail and the hope that it would be a fun vampire movie. I fast forwarded through a lot of it due to the fact that it was not that interesting. I could not find one character in the movie to root for or care about. If you want a fun vamp show with a character to root for stick with Buffy 
 This intercooler WILL ruin your 360 with prolonged use. I was getting Error 68 codes and couldn't figure out why. Turns out it was the Intercooler sucking too much power from the 360. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT 
 I found the messages this book attempted to convey indulgent, sexist, and to quote Francine chauvinistic. The idea of people being locked in a gender for an eternity seems to me a bit restrictive not to mention the rather earthly marriage rituals (waiting for the men to initiate the process of eternal union). I am not even going to go into the counsel of elders comprised of only male spirits. And tough luck for you introverts, obviously you have not evolved to the level of your extroverted counterparts. While I like to read intelligently written books about dimensions other than the one we live in, I found that even for a fantasy book this was lacking imagination. Perhaps Francine would do well to stick to her parties, it seems that they very much color her worldview. This book made me feel sad, angry and gullible for buying it. It was my first book from this author and needless to say my last 
 There is nothing good I can say about this movie.  There is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining about it.  If the main-characters didn't go by the names of Mario & Luigi, you'd be lost.  Nothing here resembles the video-game it's based on, which isn't a bad thing neccessarily...  ...except that nothing here resembles any kind of story.  The acting is bad, perhaps on purpose...  ...but who cares? It's not amusing in the slightest.   The movie is boring. In 90 minutes, you'll want to gouge your eyes out.  "Super Mario Bros." -- the movie -- has been proven to damage brain-cells upon each viewing.  In a Koopa-shell, don't waste your time on this movie. Don't even look at the cover. Don't even read this review. Just try and pretend this "movie" doesn't exist

 I was very disappointed with this teaball. It is not readily apparent from the picture but this product is actually shaped like a small cylinder, 3cm high with ~ a 6cm diameter. The cylinder twists apart in the middle to open. The problem is that first of all it is not tall enough to grasp firmly and has no 'handle' points, and second the actual locking mechanism is simply based on a push and twist design, but the metal parts do not fit together properly and are very hard to twist. Wrenching the teaball seems a good way to get tea all over the floor.  In fact, this first day I received the teaball I practiced opening it several times and eventually it became stuck, I was unable to open it until the next morning. Even if my particular product was somehow bent I cannot see how this mechanism could hold up to repeated use.  Hopefully Amazon will have another teaball soon 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 Adrienne Rich has to be the most over-rated poet in history. Her work would be completely forgotten if it was judged as poetry, but because she has been adopted as the ideological idol of PC fanatics everywhere, she has become an untouchable icon of the present. Rich is best compared, intellectually, to the literary drudges of Soviet Russia, who extolled the glories of the people for the Communist Party. The diffrence, obviously, is that Rich is not embraced by the State, but by the buddy system that is academic feminism. This volume, complete with the breathless worship -- oh, sorry, critical scholarly attention -- of the editor, is a very fine presentation of what is, for all practical purposes, the work of a transient figure whose prominence is entirely dependent on the current PC state of the American academic establishment. If you wandered to this book because it claims to be poetry, why not skip it and try someone with some soul adn some real poetic talent 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 Possibly one of the worst movies ever made, Bo and John Derek managed to massacre the Tarzan legend while wreaking cinematic havoc with this unbelievably bad waste of celluloid. Where to begin....the lousy script, the poopy cinematography, the atrocious acting....I can't think of enough adjectives to describe how putrid this actually is. As for erotic - forget it. Jane should have boffed the ape instead. Jane and papa head through the jungle, delayed by her repeated falls into the river. Despite the time period, when women were supposed to be modest, Jane doesn't seem to know what underwear is. Yeesh. I can't believe people actually paid to see this tripe. If you must watch it, rent it and save some $. You'll be glad you di 
 I would love to read a neutral book on Barry Bonds, I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate one-sided ones as well. The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge (whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).  The book covers a wide variety of topics, some are puzzeling. While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an exotic dancer. I was pretty upset to read that, I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that.  This book came out right after (or because of) Game of Shadows. This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information, guess that backfired Pearlman. In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well.  The book uses many annoymous sources (there is a reference sheet in the back, most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources), so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay.  The book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people, they like to find good stories. That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it. Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now. Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that.  So once again, the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground. This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires, ran into the stands to attack people, slept with hookers, drank all the time, was mean to Lou Gherig, etc.  While that may be true it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste, just like this 
 I hate this music because it is boring, stupid, and downright weak. Let's go over the songs.  1. "The Tide Is High 0/10 I hate this song! Blondie is the worst group in music history.  2. "Dancing Queen" 0/10 I hate Abba to no end!  3. "I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself" 0/10 I hate Dusty Springfield until armageddon comes. I hate this album because it does not have any music of the macabre, sinister, and devilish. So if you want music then look somewhere else, otherwise, stay clear of this mess 
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 pretending that 3-6 never happened (don't we all wish that!) this flea bag starts with ms.curtis hiding out as the head mistress of a private school(with a false name what kind of back ground check did they use on her) and still living in fear of her brother michael. well as you can guess he's back and still a little pissed off that she became a star and he has had to do all these bad sequels.    nothing new here and nothing worth seeing (but at least we do get to see jamie and her late mother janet (playing her "pyscho" role once again) act together for what would be the last time).  just a waste of time but i hope it helped put ms. curtis's daughter in collage, as that is the only reason i can think of that would get her back into this mess 
 After hearing and reading a number of astonishing things about this book, I had to give it a read.  What I found was not exactly what I expected.  While some sources have described the Dru character as a "sinister dictator", the truth is not quite so interesting.  The book itself is nowhere near as interesting.  Upon opening the book to the table of contents, one can't help but take notice of the number of chapters in this book.  There are 53 chapters in just 173 pages!  For those of you who don't have a math minor, that's a little over 3 pages per chapter.  And for some reason, many of the chapters are explicit continuations of the chapter before.  What was the point of this?  Why not keep the two chapters a single chapter?   Needless to say, the writing here is atrocious.  The plot is paper-thin, the characters don't develop one iota, and a romance sub-plot rears its ugly head on the last two pages of the book!  How was this book published?  Why was it put into print?  Therein lies the intrigue.  While it was anonymously written at the time, it is today well-known that the author of this book was Colonel Edward Mandell House (he gives a little hint in the text when two characters meet at Mandell House [yeesh!]), who was the virtual co-president of the United States with Woodrow Wilson.  Wilson admitted time and again that House was his "alter ego", even to the point that House was given accomodations in the White House.  Why is all this important?  Philip Dru leads a revolution against the United States government.  Not a bad thing in and of itself, if the reasons had been more compelling.  What happens in the aftermath, however, brings shudders to students of history.  Philip Dru becomes dictator of the United States, without too much reservation.  He tosses out the national constitution, as well as the state constitutions, and has them rewritten.  He institutes a graduated income tax (which did not exist at that time in the U.S. because it was ruled unconstitutional;  however, with the "ratification" of the 16th amendment just a year or two after the publication of this book, we got one for the first time and have lived under it ever since), forces popular election of senators, nationalizes industry, and reorganizes the entire government at his whim.  And Dru is definitely portrayed as the friendly protagonist.  If the First Lady were to write a book calling for revolution, abolition of the constitution, and a unitary dictator, would we worry?  I sure hope so.    But more worrisome is the fact that all of these thing eventually did come to pass in this country.  (Sure, the constitution wasn't abolished and rewritten.  However, the New Deal Supremee Court made rulings that effectively gave Congress carte-blanche to pass ANY law it felt like, even those that explicitly violate the constitution [see USA PATRIOT Act]).  Was House prescient?  Did he simply see the tides of popular opinion swarming over the masses?  Or was he simply one of the many manipulating the domestic policy of our republic behind the scenes?  The structure and execution of this book are amateurish at best, more likened to the writing of a 10th grader than any kind of real author.  Perhaps that is the point.  This book was clearly aimed at the unwashed masses.  Every piece of dialog in this book espouses the benefits of socialism and evil of capitalism.  But this effort is so transparent that it leaves us with nothing of any literary merit, and in its place only political ramblings of a clear Fabian socialist.  These ramblings, of course, entail bringing up relevant issues and injustices (female suffrage, corporate exploitation) and packaging them with solutions that involve only the addition and centralization of power in the federal government.  While those who educate themselves will see this work for what it is, the many people who read this book (not today, since people don't read, but back then there were probably more than a few) would end up buying into bad solutions for exaggerated problems.  There is absolutely no reason to buy this book.  The price simply doesn't justify it.  A reader will gain no enjoyment from it.  This book only redeems itself in its historical context:  it was written by a man who pushed Woodrow Wilson to sign the Federal Reserve Act, which destroyed our economy and continues to devalue our money to this day;  to lead us into World War I, despite his campaign promises not to (the Lusitania was carrying English munitions and was a valid military target); and to attempt to sacrifice the sovereignty of our nation to a world governing body in the League of Nations, which our Congress rightly rejected 
 out of date with the latest versions of Adobe Premiere ver. 5.1 and subsequent versions.  Wait until the book is updated 
 I was so excited to try this product from all of the great reviews that I read on it- boy where they wrong. I used this product for 2 months and saw no difference in my skin at all. I have used a lot of products and would have to rate this down at the bottom of my list- especially for how much it cost 
 When the Zyliss arrived, I removed it from the shipping box.  I did not try to use the product until several weeks after receipt.    It has a slider button which does not slide.  Perhaps that is the problem.  I have not been able to chop anything with it.  If I am using it incorrectly, I am unable to figure it out.  Unfortunately, I discarded the shipping package which I recycled as usual.  If I can obtain packaging for this disappointing tool, I will return it post-haste to Amazon.  
 The authors use of words make the British Redcoat seem foolish and weak. If this book is meant to be about the battles of the revolution then why are all the American victories listed and yet not all of the British ones? Makes no sense to me seeing as the British won most of the battles.   If you want to read a 'false feel good propoganda' type of book then feel free to go for this one BUT take everything you read with  a massive pinch of salt. It's these type of books that have completely churned factual history into a euphoria of false patriotic rhetoric.  Rebels and Redcoats will provide you with a far more comprehensive and factual base from which to look at the war from.   
 Great price, poor product. They are beautiful upon arrival. I washed them according to manufacturer's instructions. You would not believe the copius amounts of lint that piled up in the lint catcher of my dryer (usually a sign of poor fabric quality). While folding them up, I discovered that most of the hems had unraveled and frayed. And I hadn't even used them yet! Unbelievable. I returned them for a full refund, including shipping (and I stupidly purchased 2 sets). Goes to show you get what you pay for. Never again 
 I saw this with an open mind, as some modern remakes have been pretty good.  This was not one of them.  Other than the title and number of children, this bore absolutely no resemblance to either the original with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball, or the book it was based on (Who Gets the Drumstick? -- Helen Beardsley).  The main theme of this movie seemed to be "how stupid can we make our parents look".  If you are going to remake a movie, try to make it better, rather than just trying to capitalize on the earlier movie's name and popularity 
 The assertion that ours is a "Christian nation" is an idea built on several misconceptions.  The first misconception is that there is no separation of church and state. It is clear, in a free country such as ours, that the church is not supposed to interfere in governmental affairs, and the government is not suposed to interfere in church affairs. That's a central tenet to our government that prevents both religious and governmental tyranny.  It does NOT mean that Christians can't be in government. There are many Christians in government today. It also does NOT mean that Christians can't vote. The concept of church and state separation is not meant to persecute but to protect - protect the government from infringment by the church, and the church from infringement by the government.  The second misconception is that separation of church and state is not in the Constitution. Maybe not the exact phrase, but there are lots of words not found in the Constitution that we use. Federalism is an example. The doctrine of the trinity, to which most Christians ascribe, is not in the Bible. Separation of church and state - the belief that the government should remain neutral to religion and that religion should not rule the government - is clearly the meaning of the First Amendment, which says that "Congress shall make no law RESPECTING AN ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIGION nor preventing the free exercise thereof". Respecting an establishment of religion means that the government should remain neutral towards all the religions in its country, so that one religion is not made to bow to the beliefs and whims of another.  Many enjoy throwing out random quotes, taken out of context, from our founding fathers and uses it to try to prove their assertions that there is no separation of church and state. Considering, however, that our founding fathers had come from a country that established a national religion, and that while non-members of the Church of England were not persecuted, they were likely treated differently - perhaps even ostracized for their rebellion - I believe that our founding fathers did believe that a certain religion should not have precedence over others.  We have modern examples that illustrate much better than words and rhetoric why church and state separation is a good idea. There are places in the world today where Christians are shot to death for even owning a Bible. Obviously, we don't want to see that type of oppression here in the United States. And even if we didn't have church and state separation, we likely wouldn't. Still, I believe that the separation of church and state prevents such events from ever happening.  One very common misconception is that kids are unable to pray and read their Bible in public schools. This is not true.  In 1962, the Supreme Court banned MANDATORY prayer. The problem is not that kids pray, but that they are forced to pray. I don't believe that anyone would like to be forced to pray; religious expression should be voluntary and natural, not foisted upon someone. I also don't believe that many parents would be happy if their children were required to pray to Buddha or Allah every morning.  The right to pray freely in public school is, happily, just as intact as it was prior to 1962. There are numerous examples of kids praying silently in school rooms every morning. Every September, kids in high schools gather together to participate in See You At The Pole.  The same is true about the Bible. There has not been any legislative act to ban the Bible from public school, and I believe that as long as there is a sizeable population of Americans who rightfully take their religion seriously, this will never happen.  Unfortunately, many teachers in public school have likely kept the kids in their care from reading the Bible, thinking that reading the Bible in school was illegal.  Another common misconception is that Christians are persecuted in America. Considering that Christians have the freedom to worship, to follow any set of beliefs that they choose, to pray, to gather together in a worship together, to gather together in conferences, to evangelize, to vote, to hold office, and to voice concerns about religious freedom, it is obvious that this is not true.  Personally, I don't agree with the ACLU's campaign to remove crosses from grave stones. That's an extreme position. At the same time, I do not believe that one religion should be given preference over others. There are many people in this country, and very likely just as many religious traditions. These people are probably just as serious about their religion as Christians. Should they not have the right to worship freely?  Nobody is out to "get" Christianity, and the separation of church and state is not a vehicle to this end. We only want to make sure that the government remains faithful to the Constitutional principle of religious freedom through neutrality. Upon closer examination, many people will likely agree that this is a central tenet of our country, and a principle that deserves to be upheld for our current generation, and for generations to come 
 The way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use.  I would get the Furminator instead, it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes!  This technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove 
 I was terribly disappointed with this King release.  Could a creative writing student done better?  Perhaps.   It was by far the worst published work I've ever read.  It was unreadable.  Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed.  The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere.  The book seemed to be published on his name alone.  I have been disappointed in S. King  for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch.  I am a long time fan, I began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book I read, written by him, was Hearts In Atlantis.  
 I'm appalled at this marketing.  I've read every book Mr. Woods has written and have enjoyed them all.  This type of marketing should not be allowed. It would have been simple to make the Cover obvious as to contents.  For those who have not read the novels it's a good deal, otherwise very disappointing advertising 
 Andrew Weill is perhaps the most well-known of these type of practioners.  Unfortunately, some of what he has to say has been clinical disproven. For example, in study after study, large amnounts of Vitamin C given orally do absolutely nothing more than a   placebo for cancer patient.  Yet he still preaches this.  Given intravenously, actually, there is some evidence that it may work for some people..but it does not work by stimulating your immune system..it works in a different way.  The book How To treat and Prevent Cancer with Natural Medicine is far superios in my opinion, even though it was written by four naturopaths in 2002.  Even then they admitted that clinical studies were showing that there was no advantage of taking Vitamin C orally over a placebo,  and the authors freely admitted it. But much of what the discussed in that book..Eight Magic supplements to take when you have cancer..has actually been proven. I am a cancer patient with myeloma.  Maitake D fraction, curcumin (it must be taken w/bioperine an hour before meals), selenium, and some other things they mention have all been proven in clinical studies or are being worked on.  They do not promise that they have a cure of anything..they only say it may help in the context of complimentary medicine. They do not claim an organic diet will cure cancer or that medical science would hide it if they have a cure.  The book by Quiallan I think claims that an organic diet will cure you, and there is post after post that this has actually worked.  Maybe it has..but as a myeloma patient..my immune system is overstimulated, so I cannot take most immune system supplements..and some like Vitamin C are actually antagonistic In Vitro to myeloma treatments..this usually translates to the same thing in the body..unlike positive in studies that often do not pan out.  Anyway, I am not saying Dr. Weill is all wrong, but do not pretend he has a cure.  I have known secondhand two people who have been cured by long fasts of only carrot juice, another two by healers (I  am not religious), and one who claims that barley juice and lowering his PH totally got rid of his cancer.  I believe these people all may have gotten rid of their LOCALIZED tumors this way. For blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloma (a cancer of blood produced in the marrow), we do not exactly have localized tumors.  But with the addition of supplements mentioned in Dr. Murray et al's book, my response to medications has been phenomenal and I have went into remission. Unfortunately, at this time, myeloma always comes back from remission. There is new understanding why this may be so..that just came out December 2005.  There is even a drug available..but it will not be available to myeloma patients for a long while 
 Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead 
   I like Machine Head a lot.  Many people disliked "The Burning Red" and called them sell-outs, but I appreciated the effort to make something different.  Then came "Supercharger".  I have listened to it a dozen times, looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it.  It never came.  This is a bad CD by a great band. 
 This is the first of Spider Robinson's books that I can honestly say sucked. Cal's Legacy wasn't real good, and I thought it time to retire Callahan's, but then Spider found the "key" and put out a fine installment. Yahoo, I bought his next book -- The Free Lunch -- in HC, and while not great, not bad, good enough to warrant shelling out for the HC of Cal's Con. Ohhh, if this were my intro to the wonderful world of Robinson, I would not return. If you haven't read, but are thinking of/wanting to, then may I suggest waiting for the SC; at least at ten bucks the disappointment won't be quite as monumental. Better idea, check it out from the library, cuz crap like it -- juevenile, illogical, and unimaginative -- should not be paid for. Bad enough it takes four hours to read. Heh Spider, I want a refund, or at least a discount on your next non-Callahan novel (I'm not giving up on him yet, but he's on, well, call it double-secret probation. 
 I have just finished the first two modules and let me tell you that if you are a pure beginner to HTML, DO NOT get this book.  Module two is very confusing with very few examples for the beginner.  I have been designing pretty decent web pages (www.pacificlittleleague.org) with MS Frontpage 2002 and wanted to learn HTML so I could advance to using javascript & flash.  This book was a mistake purchase.  It is not for the beginner.  I have read all of the other comments that convinced me to buy this book, and all I can say is that maybe this would be a good book if you have already dabbled in some HTML.  If you look at some of the test questions at the end of module 2, such as #9 which asks about the proper XHTML format for closing the hr tag, you will find that she hasn't even covered the tag hr yet.  In # 11 it asks to rewrite "the text below" so that it doesn't show up on a web page - and then there is no text shown that could be rewritten.  The author really needs to get in a frame of mind to that of a true beginner if she is going to sell this book as a beginner book 
 Jean Fritz' attempt to tell the story of Paul Revere's ride is an engaging tale, but it is riddled with the myths that have accumulated around this pivitol event in U.S. history. She does a good job giving Revere's personal history, and readers can get a good sense of the context in which he was working. Still, she refuses to let go of some myths that have long since been proven false. Of course, no historian still believes in the "one if by land, two if by sea" nonsense that Longfellow invented for his 19th century poem. But Fritz includes it here as if it is fact. And how's this for a misleading version of the reasons behind the revolution: "Now the English were causing trouble, telling the colonies they couldn't do this and couldn't do that, slapping on taxes, one after another." Hmm.  Well, what Fritz doesn't tell you is that the "this and that" the English were telling the colonists not to do consisted primarilly of burning native settlements and murdering the inhabitants. The English had a non-confrontational policy toward the natives along the colonial border, while the Americans wanted to move in and take the land, by force if necessary. This was one of the main disagreements between the colonies and the English, but Fritz hides this behind some silly word choices. She also neglects to tell readers that the taxes were being levied to pay for the defense of the colonies during the French-Indian War (quite a reasonable stance from their point of view). This book is OK on a very surface level, when read as a strict adventure tale. But don't make the mistake of thinking that this is very serious history 
 I read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that I was not in the right space to appreciate this book when I read it. This was the most boring piece of literature ever written. I know it was a period piece/coming of age story etc., but pages upon pages of people picking cotton, talking about cotton, and talking about picking cotton...zzzzzz....it took me forever to finish because I kept passing out and having nightmares of- yep, cotton 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 Tihs Album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day. I like all his other albums better I don't Know why he decided to release this crap.But the only song I really Like is hip hip qurtables 
 I do get annoyed when a book's title does not reflect what the book is about. The writer did not use his mathematics in any way so I find it misleading to say, a mathematician plays the stock market.   In this case this book is actually two separate books twisted into one.   The first book is of a guy moaning about his loss on the stock market and how unfair and dishonest the market can be. Annoyingly the figure that he lost is not specified, but I suspects its not that much!  It is quite clear that the writer did not  1) Ask any reputable person who had any experience in the share market  for advise 2) He did not read any book on the stock market to help him make his selection 3) He did no research on the company   The other book is a discussion of varies models of the stock market, some of which are mathematical in part. These models are reasonably well explained in a very simple way but if they don't fit into the writers preconceived ideal they are quickly eliminated. For example part of William Buffet success, the book claims is because people follow his lead.  Something that is quite difficult to do, as what Buffet's buys is not released. He has a special deal with the US goverment that allows him not to release the information. Peter Lynch's success is noted but no explanation is given, its just brushed aside.  Now let us say he had listened to some of these theories he so arrogantly rejected. Some that spring to mind are   1)The fundamental theories would have told him that WorldCOM was overpriced 2)The technical analysis theories would have told him that its going down. 3) Almost all books would have told him to diverse his stock and not stick to one share. I am sure there are more.  I have been involved in the stock market for many years and it is a subject that I know something about. In my experience stock market is risky. For every winner there is at least one loser. For every big winner generally there are a few losers.  The successful ones do study the stock market in detail and they depend upon substantial understanding of the share market system but knowledge is not enough, you need something else as well. If it was simply knowledge and easy, then arrogant inexperienced fools like this writer who are obviously extremely intelligent would have made money instead of losing it 
 I didnt really enjoy this book that much. It was kind of straight forward writing that definately did not grab me. Maybe because the story just wasnt that unusual or fascinating, i dont know.  Also the wife was kind of a slut so i had less sympathy for her than i had did for other victims in other crime books i have read.  If you like this kind of book, then read "She wanted it all". Now that was a great book, maybe because the mother was so dispicable 
 I've been a Sandra Brown fan for many years - and still am - however, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buy the hardback.  This was definitely not her best work.  Try your library first 
 With all the great revues on this frother, I thought I couldn't go wrong buying one.  Not so though!!  After following instructions in detail, the frother I received keeps getting stuck in the 'on' position and also seems to have 2 speeds.  Also, just to prove a point more to myself, I frequently have to take the top/cap off and press the button to get it to go fast (I don't actually use it to froth this way) ... or use 2 hands to hold it and press the button which is very awkward and then even that doesn't help sometimes.  The bottom line is that it will very seldom operate at it's normal speed or it gets stuck on!!  Clearly this frother isn't working the way it should and is somehow getting stuck or the button doesn't go down enough.  I was going to keep it anyway, but decided to return it as I seem to have no control over wheather it wants to go fast or slow.  I really like that it has it's own stand, so I'm very dissappointed that I can't get it to work properly.  This is a real shame as I was prepared to love this little frothing machine 
 Well he fixed all his bugs. He thinks he is in spiral model of life cycle publishing, Good Grief!  Added few more projects which are poorly written, especially project www redirection - chapter 19. When I am paying 60 bucks, I expect some quality content. Oho, well maybe my expectations are more because he is targettng the student community. They are not paying you to read your book but they will download of some p2p file sharing network. We pay so I think I have every right to demand. The difference is obvious when a book is written by academic professor versus a professional software developer with tons of experience.  I would suggest, stick to Richard Stevens, unless you are in that Texas school where he teaches 
 If you are an expert in XPath then this book might be worth having.  But if you only have a general knowledge of XPath this book is basically useless.  The author clearly has a solid knowledge of his topic.  But the ability to communicate it in a practical way is sorely lacking 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Actually I turned it off after the first 30 minutes because it was so dumb. My brother convinced me to finish it because he said it got better. Well it didn't, it got worse. Nothing but violence, sex, and drugs. All action and no plot. The sex scene in the middle of China Town with a bus load of kids watching was the stupidest thing they could of put in the movie. Don't waste your time watching this!! 
 While this book is a classic in American history it does not compare to modern histories. While Parkman selectively uses his evidence and omits key details the prose is very good. Overall though this book should not be used due to the inaccuracies.  He also omits the contributions of the Indians which was a decisive factor in the war. See either Crucible of War, Empires at war or The Scratch of a Pen.  
 Brigitte Sassen (ed.), in Kant's Early Critics: The Empiricist Critique of the Theoretical Philosophy, freshly translates and thematically organizes the reactions of Kant's contemporaries to the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1781) and, thus, renders a considerable service to students of European thought in the eighteenth century.  Using articles written between 1781 and 1789 by Jacobi, Feder, Tiedemann, and other eighteenth century commentators, Sassen (McMaster University) makes it rather easy to follow the complex polemics on space, time, logic, empiricism, idealism, and Kant's critical philosophy in general.   Although somewhat forgotten today, these debates and discussions are of great historical importance because they led directly to some of the crucial revisions in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason.   This collection of articles and essays forms a companion edition to the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Less advanced readers will be helped by biographical notes, a very simple German-English glossary, and a short but useful bibliography.  This book will be very useful to any reader interested in the ideas of the Enlightenment and encourage students and professors from many disciplines to revisit this important chapter in European intellectual history 
 While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point 
 I am a full-figured woman at 5'10.  I am always searching for books that will optimize my wardrobe and give me the best look possible in my clothes.  I recevied this book today and it is the WORST book I have read in this subject.  The 3 body types are very vague, not clear of what type of person fits each category (a silhouette picture would have been very helpful here). A Tankini, what is that? The same points are repeated throughout the book.  Finally, this book is written for women who see themselves as fat and need to learn how to put on clothes just to walk out of the house, not with any style or sense of self.  I will not even give this book away, it is horrible to give to someone else.  
 While reading this book I found the details of some cases to be unbelievable.  Also, the "photographs" of the murderers and detectives all looked fuzzy and more like drawings.  I've read a lot of true crime and never heard of catching a murderer because he breathed his asthma medication on the murder victim's hair.  Or because they chemically deduced which cologne he wore. And who leaves their backdoor open when they know a violent Doberman Pinscher has been getting through their backyard fence? Sure, just let that dog on in. And whose place of employment has a record of all employee's blood "groups" (not their TYPES, just their GROUPS), when the employee doesn't even know HIMSELF what group he is?  Then I read the introduction, which I always skip, and found out this book is FICTION, not true crime as the cover announced and in which section it was in in the book store.  As FICTION, it's okay, (I prefer Agatha Christie), but I don't believe the forensic work in this book is even based on any fact. So read it for entertainment, but don't be so gullible as to believe any of it 
 Major points of Webbs work Slaves, Women and Homosexuals a Cultural Analysis  Webb is exploring the hermeneutics of cultural analysis.  His desire is to be more culture oriented in our understanding of the biblical texts and more culture oriented in our 21st century application. His premise is that in the evangelical community there needs to be greater understanding of the Biblical documents in light of their real life application in their context.  Unless we do so we are at odds as to how to clearly interpret the scriptures and apply them in our day.  The Major features of his particular hermeneutic are to embrace a "redemptive movement hermeneutic".  This is '"Moving the contemporary appropriation of the text beyond its original application framing." " Sometimes doing the text "living out the Bible's literal words in our modern context fails to fulfill its redemptive spirit.""  For example if we were to live out the spoils of war ethic today we would fall far short of the redemptive element.  We are far beyond needing a spoils of war ethic in today's world.  "This movement is beyond the original application of the text in the ancient world."  We must distinguish between Kingdom values and Cultural values.   A redemptive movement hermeneutic has 5 components 1. Redemptive movement: Grants the principle that movement is what God initially wanted.  This movement is to bring a more just, more equitable, more loving form. Look at the text in its social context.  Is there movement? Example slaves are to be more fairly treated.  Is the movement preliminary or absolute?  Was fairer treatment of the slaves the end, which God had in mind or was actually the end of slavery what the ultimate ethic would lead us to? Without calling for the abolition of slavery the bible plants seeds which ultimately would bear fruit of its demise.  2. Multilevel ethic:  Moses gave the certificate of divorce but a higher ethic was a loving relationship between husbands and wives.  One ethic i.e. certificate of divorce was okay but one marriage with one husband and wife relationship was the higher and ultimate ethic.  3. Balanced perspective:  The balance is Original Culture/Biblical Instruction/Kingdom Ethic.  We are in process.  What changes in the culture is the text addressing?  "Don't beat your slaves."  Kingdom Ethic: slavery should be abolished, as there is no slavery in the Kingdom of God.  4. Cultural/transcultural assessment.  Is the Biblical text, dealing with cultural issues or transcultural issues?  Gen. 3 "your husband will rule over you."  Is this a cultural issue or one that transcends the culture.  1 Cor "women should cover their heads when praying".  Is this an issue that goes beyond 1st century culture?  5. Underlying spirit within the text.  What is the spirit internal to the text is it restrictive or is it pointing to more openess in the future?  Webb asserts the Bible is written in a pastoral manner.  Paul was addressing problems in his time and in his culture.  When studying 1 Corinthians 6-7 Paul is dealing with 2 different extremes," those who think that sex is as neutral as eating food and the other group who are ascetics."  Paul is not dealing with healthy sexual beings so he deals with the extremes.  The bible only wants to push the envelope as far as possible but no more as to be a burden on the hearers.  The underlying spirit of the text will lead us into greater application later.  The problems Paul dealt with in terms of slavery and women were to be more fully acted upon in the future.  Webb has constructed an elaborate system of 18 criteria by which to judge the major social questions of our day, the issue of women and their place in the church and homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. He approaches both questions and uses this grid to arrive at possible solutions.  It is quite an impressive but laborious methodology.  He basically takes Biblical texts and classifies them by asking questions and interpreting according to the grid.  Is the text providing movement in the culture?  Are there seed ideas in the text, which one could anticipate further development at a future time, which would bring more social change?  What is the basis for the need for some of these biblical instructions is it based in the creation narrative, is it based in the fall or curse narrative, really why is this spiritual condition addressed and what is its origin?   Is the condition cultural or transcultural?  The major text he deals with is 1 Tim 2:12-15.  He states that 2:13 may be transcultural and that 14 is definitely cultural.  It was not Adam who was deceived but Eve.  He sights modern evidences that woman are not more easily deceived then men.  The weight of his argument leads him to conclude that this passage is cultural.  For verse 13 he sights Luther, Calvin, Augustine, Wesley, Chrysostom, J.N.D. Kelley, Guthrie, and at least 10 more theologians who argue the traditional view that the verse is transcultural.  Webb concedes that the verse  "may" be transcultural.  He is willing to butt heads with some pretty big horns.  Verse 14 he again cites many examples of how the church interpreted that mans superiority over women is based on the fact that woman was deceived first.  He then cites scientific evidence to show that women are not any more susceptible to deception than men therefore he concludes that verse 14 is a cultural value in light that in Paul's culture women were less educated and less exposed to their culture because of male domination in society.  He concludes that Paul's reasoning in verse 14 is cultural and not a transcultural value.  After using his 18 criteria his bottom line assessment is that women should be allowed to teach in the church.  Most of the male domination in both the Old and New Testament is base on cultural values rather than transcultural values.  Concerning the issue of homosexuality he concludes that there is no redemptive hermeneutical movement, which would lead to an acceptance of homosexuality in the church.  Most of the passages on this issue tend to be restrictive and leave very little room for future openess.  This book reminds me of an alcoholic who expounds the benefits of drinking.  You want to believe him but the facts and evidence do not support his conclusions on the womens issue.  In addressing the womans issue my personal belief is that woman are equal to men as persons.  They are in no way inferior and personally woman tend to be superior to men in many respects.   That being said I have never really read a book that I felt was more "forced" in all my life.  Webb talks about finding the underlying spirit of the text.  I honestly don't think he does that at all. The underlying spirit of the text seems to be evident but the way Webb gets around it is that he tends to isolate every text like 1 Cor 11:2-16 or 1 Tim 2:13-15, or Gen 3, and attacks each one piecemeal without seeing the the weight of all those texts and many others together. But in many cases if you give Webb the perverbial inch and he takes a mile and actually he take much more than a mile.  I think he reads a lot more into the text than what God actually intended.   On the homosexual issue I believe that homosexuals are loved by the Lord as much as heterosexuals are. Webb basically agrees with traditional interpretation. I agree with him as well.  Even though I may not agree with the homosexual lifestyle as Christians we must love them unconditionally.    
  I have read five of the Elm Creek novels and enjoyed all for different reasons. This one I can't say was that great. The author kept repeating the facts over again with each character and it began to get very boring. I wanted to skip sections and move on. I would have prefered more quilting tips and information regarding quilts and less scandals 
 I'm a sicko of a Yes fan. I own all their albums on vinyl, bought them again on cassette in the 80s, and bought them again on CD in the 90s. But I've got to draw the line somewhere.  How many freakin times can a band re-release the same "greatest hits" with a different cover? When I was notified by Amazon of a new Yes album, I jumped all over it thinking, "the boys are back for the first time in 7 years!" But no, it's more like "the boys have released their 7th greatest hits CD in 7 years."  PLEASE DON'T ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR! Don't buy this album or it'll just make them do it again, and again, and again. If we all boycott future Yes greatest hits albums, then maybe they'll be forced to actually WORK for their money. I think we'd all enjoy that for a change. WHO'S WITH ME? 
 The ending was the same as so many other books along the same line that I was sorely disappointed. Especially because there were many opportunities for it to turn into something a little less predictable. A saving grace was CJ Critt's narration. )I listened to BOT). It almost made the characters interesting. This was my first Carlotta Carlyle mystery and probably my last 
 Unless you have a very small and old TV, don't buy it. The picture quality is very bad, no sharpness, blurred video. I don't know if it was just a dvd production problem affecting few copies or because this concert was recorded in Europe and there were problems in the PALM to NTSC translation, but even in the first case you still have a chance of getting a bad copy 
 Well, I just had to try another Dr. Phil book, since it has been a number of years since I read Life Strategies. To be honest, even though he can be a polarizing figure, I have nothing against him. I think his TV is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people.  This book however, was a real struggle to complete. It was not coherently structured, and the author kept saying things like "This book will show you...." all the way through the book. It felt like I never left the "Introduction" and he was continually trying to convince me (or himself) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound. Instead it really couldn't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader's attention.  Fret not! There are other books out there that tackle the same general issue, but are far better reads. I recommend:  1. Failing Forward, by John C. Maxwell 2. Today Matters, by John C. Maxwell  Again, I have no issue with the author, and applaud his efforts. However, in writing a review to my fellow Amazon customers, I must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre. Best of success to you in reaching your goals 
 This book is okay. It never really immerses you in the world--instead you just sort of skim along the top of it, half-caring about what happens next. Everyone feels like a stock characters: the "bad guys" are bumbling idiots, and the good guys (even Peter) are self-sacrificing and far-seeing. We barely even see the task force which calls itself the Starcatchers, and the book really could have survived without them. Tinkerbell doesn't show up till the last page or so (I spent most of the book wishing for the fairy to come breathe some complexity and life into the cast), and the croc never eats the clock.  As an avid Dave Barry fan, I could literally pick out which lines had been written by him. Not to say that the book was funny (because, unfortunately, it was not)--his style just flashes off the page in neon colors.  A few innuendoes will raise eyebrows--they really shouldn't have been in a book so geared toward children.  There are better books out there. Buy them instead 
 This shows what hype all this has become. SCRATCHING is beautiful but this movie sucks. It is a live performance w nothing new. No tricks, jazzy is using a laptop. Mixmaster mike bites z-trips routine. and the x-cutioners show off that they can do a whole lot of noise and make everything sound wack. Final rating WACK AS HELL. save your money for your groceries or for porn 
 This was a disappointment obviously generated to cash in on Franken's previous blockbuster on Fat Idiot and Notorious Bush Water Carrier Limbaugh. I struggled through about thirty pages before I started feeling scammed. Then again, the title hints at why this book is so spare and uninteresting 
 The key concept of this book is the existence of a new Creative Class. Richard throws into the Creative Class almost everybody and groups them in two categories: the Super Creative Core and the "creative professionals". These two groups include: scientists, professors, poets, novelists, artists, entertainers, actors, designers, architects, non-fiction writers, editors, cultural figures, researchers, analysts, programmers, engineers, filmmakers, financial services, legal and health care professionals, business management and the list goes on.  The problem is that the definition of this class is so loose. Even Richard admits that the definition is not really clear, but he goes on discarding the importance of rigour. A class must have political alignment as an expression of a common ground in the way wealth is created and distributed. It should be reflected in the way people vote; otherwise the class does not make sense. It is difficult to convince anyone that you can put these people in the same class: engineers and artists, accountants and actors.   The book uses shocking statistics and quotes and then follows through with flashy language to wrap up a nicely packaged chapter. The problem is that the book has enough time to loose the reader after seemingly never ending debates. This book has so much information and so little structure. All those tables are useless because they do not support a coherent system of principles or story. The writing is difficult to read and very repetitive. After the first fifty pages the same arguments are being rotated again and again: creativity is important, the time of agriculture has passed, the heavy industry is not important for global leadership, there is tension between individual freedom and corporation rigidity, etc.   In describing the new class, Richard Florida observes that "Fewer than one-quarter of all Americans (23.5 percent) accounted for by the 2000 Census lived in a 'conventional' nuclear family, down from 45 percent in 1960. This is social group is mentioned many times in the book. By contrast, the family social group is almost completely ignored. I have the impression that this is actually the creative class and all these indexes (Bohemian, Single, Gay, etc) match quite well the group's dynamics.   I gave this book a two stars rating purely on style and clarity and overall coherence of the book. I think that regardless of the political affiliation, the reader will have genuine difficulty in following the book from the beginning to the end. For instance, in discussing the transformations of every day life, in a polemic with other authors Richard says:   "Juxtaposed to this view are those who believe technology and unbridled market forces are making us work harder and faster, leaving us less time to enjoy each other and out interests, destroying human connections and damaging our neighbourhoods and communities. If the techno-utopians romanticize the future, these techno pessimists glorify the past. Unfettered hypercapitalism is leading to the end of work and the demise of high paying, secure jobs, according to social critics like Jeremy Rifkin. Worse yet, the elimination of such jobs destroy an important source of social stability, argues Richard Sennett, casting people adrift, corroding our collective character and damaging the very fibre of society. The workplace is evolving into an increasingly stressful and dehumanizing "white-collar sweatshop" in Fill Fraser's view, beset by long hours and chronic overwork. In the eyes of cultural critic Tom Frank, business has become an all-powerful and hegemonic cultural force, as entities like MTV and The Gap turn alternative-culture symbols into money making devices. Neighbourhoods, cities and society as a whole are losing the strong sense of community and civic-minded spirit that were the source of our prosperity, argues Robert Putnam. In his nostalgia for a bygone era of VFW halls, bowling leagues, Cub Scout troops and Little League, Putnam contends that the demise of these repositories of `social capital' is the source of virtually all of our woes..."  If you were able to read the text above without losing your concentration and you remembered what started it, then you might be able to read the book and even like it.  Otherwise you will probably find that after you read page after page you realise your thoughts were wondering somewhere else. You come back, re-read those pages, only to find you lost your thoughts again.  
 Like several other reviewers, I found this repetitive and rambling.  It is also very poorly edited, full of comma splices and run-on sentences - overall, extremely annoying.  She can be a good story teller, but over the last few years they are more and more poorly written.    The books read as if she just tells a story into a tape recorder, and no one cleans them up at all.  Second Chances was one of the worst, and this story wasn't good enough to distract from the poor sentence construction, etc.  The book seemed like just another she churned out to meet a publishing quota.    One more pet peeve:  I despise such long chapters with no breaks within them. Although I read a great deal - at least a dozen books a month - I seldom have time to read one of her whole chapters at one sitting, and I prefer having a real "stopping place". 
 I saw this item in Consumer Reports. Checked it out on Hoovers web-site and had to get it. self cleaning filter! bagless!lifetime belt! super cool handle that detatches and becomes wand!by far the best features of all vacuums.i read the reviews at Amazon about the messiness and more importantly the self cleaning filter breaking almost immediatly and i was concerned so I called a Hoover sales/service center. They assured me that that glitch was on earlier production models and had been corrected. i bought it and wow!! that baby could clean a carpet!! i loved all of the features! i even celebrated when the cleaning lady didn't show up so i could use the vacuum!! less than 1 week later the rotating filter started jamming---rendering the machine useless. couldn't get anyone at Hoover to pick up the phone. Returned to Amazon and am getting the Hoover electronic bagless canister that, at last count, had over 180 reviews--most of them positive. Shame on Hoover!!!!!! 
 The first unit's RPM meter did not work and it smelled like it was overheating.  The second unit's RPM meter did not work.  I ended up sending both units back.  I think I'll get stuck with shipping on both units.  This buying experience will probably cost me $40 to $60 in shipping 
 I have gone through 4 pairs in 4 months because they keep breaking, one thing after another.   Either one ear stops or they both stop in the same Hour!!!  I wouldn't dare unless you can return them easy 
 Eric Hobsbawm, dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of "scientific" Marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history, wields the critic's pen more like a butcher's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes, a la Don Quixote, he is thrusting. So it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as Hobsbawm's Sancho Panza. As such I appeal to you, Eric, not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian, for it is the most preposterous thing I have ever encountered. Perhaps you were intrigued with the Greeks' romantic, albeit "unscientific," appeal to the muse for inspiration? How else can we, your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth, justice and the human way in the study of history, explain this unhistorical incantation? Have courage, though! We know that your unwavering adherence to the "scientific" precepts of Marxism will excuse everything. In short, Eric, we know that you have been writing too much while watching Star Trek 
 I agree with many reviewers here that the book is great, but poorly organized and put too much on statistical methods. I have read through it from cover to cover for my exams.  Nevertheless, the first part discussion is very good, but you need to read other books before reading Rothman's book. Acutally, I really hate Greenland's writing, it is too obscure. I would not recommend this book to students 
 This movie was on TNT and the dvd will not make it any better. This might be worse then Viva Knievel from 1977. While I thought George Eads was a good choice I didn't think so after watching it. The book by Steve Mandich was great and very accurate but the movie suffers from a poor script . You never find out why Evel started to jump for a living. They never show the showman part of Evel. Instead they show really stupid things like Evel going to the bathroom twice in the movie. 
 I am a huge fan of Linda Howard's books. I have purchased each and every one of them. I live in Israel so getting her books in English from the U.S.A. isn't cheap Cover of Night was the most disappointing book of Linda Howard's I have ever read. It was boring and I foung myself turning the pages and looking for something interesting to read in that particular book. I hope the next one is more interesting. I will keep looking forward to her books since I have enjoyed and re-read many of the ones I have 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation

 This book contains sound advice and concrete steps that, if followed properly, will help enhance and improve your self-image. According to the founder of Psycho-Cybernetics, Maltz Maxwell, the concept of self-image is irrefutably the most important aspect of our lives; once we have gained a positive self-image we will feel much better both mentally and physically. Thus, self-image is crucial to maintaining mental and physical health. Maxwell goes even farther holding that whether or not we succeed in our professional life depends to a great extent on how we view ourselves. Having a positive self-image makes it much easier to achieve our goals. One way to improve our self-image is to revise our thinking and to stop focusing on negative events. Also, the way we think about the aversive events in our life must change, it is imperative that we do not dwell on them. Instead of allowing these events to impair our self-image, we should act on them by actively finding adequate solutions. More importantly, the events to which we have no immediate solutions or over which we have no control should be completely ignored. Another important point made in this book is that we can control our emotional responses and this is an extremely powerful tool. Subsequently, we can decide how we want to feel or what we wish to think, according to Maltz.   The basic principle of Psycho-Cybernetics is actually quite simple: what you think in your conscious mind eventually becomes automatized in your subconscious mind. This means that if you decide that you believe in yourself and that you control your own life, these beliefs will soon be stored in your subconscious mind. An analogy is appropriate here: when learning to drive a car, initially you have to coordinate a number of different steps. As practice makes perfect, gradually these steps become automatized and you will no longer need to consciously monitor every step in order to drive. This is a crucial process because once your positive self-image becomes an inherent part of your subconscious mind then the process will be complete.   While this book is interesting and many techniques found in it are useful, there are shortcomings. First, it is common sense that positive self-esteem and self-image play a pivotal role in every individual's life. We all know that optimistic thinking promotes not only mental but also physical health. Moreover, techniques outlined in this book do not constitute anything new or revolutionary; people already know that they must challange their false beliefs and replace them with new ones. Like all other self-help books, even this one tends to be simplistic, repetitive and occasionally tedious.   Psychologists have long known that human behavior is dynamic, unpredictable and extremely complex. To explain why we think the way we do in one book is impossible. Most authors of self-help books tend to downplay the significance of highly important factors such as childhood in shaping an individual's personality. Even those vaguely familiar with psychology know that a cognitive theory (the one on which all self-help books are based) has serious drawbacks. Thus, in order to fully understand how self-esteem works we must take an integrated approach, the one involving the findings of cognitive, behaviorist, psycho-analytical and biological theories. Failure to interweave these theories will inevitably result in simplistic and flawed analyses. Simply telling someone to be optimistic will prove insufficient in the long run.   Popular psychology, I like to call it sensationalist, frequently promises fast results with no or little effort but almost always offers seriously flawed and superficial analyses. One final comment: whenever you come across a title of the book that sounds too good to be true, then skip it. Despite its oversimplified analysis, Psycho-Cybernetics does however provide an insight into the immense importance of self-esteem/self-image in every person's life. Please note that it is not my intent to discourage you from purchasing this book. On the contrary, it is always best to read it and decide for yourself.   
 It's not like Van Wilder was very good either, but I'm a fan of Kal Penn so I wanted to see this. He's ok, but the rest of the movie is just not very good. Lousy script to start with. I guess I'll just have to wait for Harold and Kumar Go to Amsterdam, or whatever they're calling it now 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 I'm not going to write too much. If you need to hear more just check other reviews down here. From all the 3 episodes only the first one, by Kar-Wai, is worth your time.  "The Hand" is well done and typical Kar-Wai. Beautifully shot by his usual contributor Christopher Doyle, it's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch. Gong Li, always very elegant, give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story. Well crafted but very predictable. The director lately seems to be referencing himself, which is halfway form self parody. "Equilibrium" is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy. Other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots, is a simple and boring exchange between Downey Jr. playing an adman and his analyst played by Arkin. But the worst by far is the Antonioni's episode. Is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment. The, once, great director should have just retired by now (he was 91 in 2004) and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces 
 I'm afraid that the reviewers who didn't like this movie understood it all too well.  At times it promises real drama and tension, but never delivers.  There are too many character twists with no basis.  And the ending really does make the viewer feel cheated.  This is a really poor attempt at making a movie 
 The wok is atually made of carbon iron, but not cast iron. The name of the item is misleading. I regret purchasing it 
 The shoes would have been awesome but..... the sizes run extremely small. I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen. The shoes are still too small. 
 I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat.  The ending left me empty and unsatisfied.  If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area.  Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map 
 I can't understand the raving reviews. It is weak on math, and has no practical example on CG. Let me give you an example: Chapter 2 (allegedly on "Matrix Methods"), exercise 2.20 (there are 25): Compute the determinant of the following matrix (I'll use Matlab/Scilab notation): M = [ 2 0; -3 2] Are you serious? What about learning Limits and Continuity in one short chapter? No comments...Seriously, if you don't already know this stuff, should you be looking at CG in the first place?  After I got this book, I got F.S. Hill's Computer graphics Using OpenGL, which is much thicker, mathematically oriented, and has practical examples in C++, and Parberry's and Dunn's 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development which doesn't attempt so much as Hill's and Mortenson's, but has nice code in C++. There might be better options. Not to mention that one has to buy and study real math books. I give it 1 star as the book falls short of its stated goals of preparing the reader for more advanced study. 
 Like most reviewers, I grew up with this book and loved it as a child.  However, even then I had one question:  why call him "Little BLACK Sambo"?  Why not just "Little Sambo"?    Many reviewers here have defended this book against the charges of racism.  One guy even goes so far as to say if you think it's racist you hate other cultures.  I don't have a clue as to what that is supposed to mean, but this book is racist.  Just is.  However, instead of saying "is" or "is not", I'm actually going to explain my opinion.    This book was written by a Scottish woman living in India in 1899.  The original illustrations, presumably replicated in this edition, feature Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo as having inky black skin and big red lips.  Subsequent American volumes had drawing of the characters in blackface.  As a result of these exaggerated illustrations, the word "Sambo" became a racial slur in America directed at African-Americans.    Now, as another reviewer noted, this is set in India, not Africa.  I'm not sure how that is meant to excuse the book, but I'm guessing that since the word Sambo was directed as a slur against African-Americans, we can safely chock that up to a misreading of the book by Americans.  Not so.  A glimpse at the history of race, and specifically "blackness" will show that Indians, Africans, and even the Irish were considered "black".  "Black" in this sense meaning both a physical characteristic as well as a way of saying "other than Anglo".  It was a claim also that was disparaging to their "perceived" level of sophistication as human beings.  As such, words such as the "n-word" (I won't spell it out since this is a page for a kid's book) were levelled at Africans and Indians (and Irishmen) equally.  It stands to reason, then, that "Sambo" was a derrogatory term lobbed at all who were looked upon as savage, different, or unequal to "white" folks.  This cannot be ignored, nor excused.  Ms. Bannerman's Sambo stories have historically done a lot of damage, and even added a racial slur to American speech.  This is not just, as one person says, over-sensitive adults overreacting.  If you are an African-American and have been called a "sambo" it's hardly overreacting to take offense.  This book, historically, has had a place in the canon of racist western literature, and no amount of charm the story has can change this unfortunate fact 
 I bought this item to deter flies because it says it will work with flying insects.  Flies will actually land and sit on it without any apparent problems.  I gave it to charity 
 I had used some of the earlier books in this series to teach my children and had enjoyed them.  In this last book, however, the author is writing about history that many of us have actually lived through.  I was disappointed and surprised to find that her writing was so biased and opinionated.  I really wish she had just stuck to the facts.  Although she is entitled to her opinion, and these opinions gave us a lot to talk about, because of her own bias she emphasized certain issues and people, while barely mentioning others.  Towards the end of the book I found that she had some of her facts simply outright wrong, and this was disheartening as it cast a shadow on all the information reported in her other books.  I found it very surprising that a history book for children would have errors in the facts, and that it would be used to so shamelessly support someone's personal political agenda.  Again, there is no reason why someone can't write and publish a book like this, but it should not be presented as an unbiased children's "history" book, because this book is certainly not that.  I was quite disappointed 
 I agree 100% with this review. The premise behind the book has great promise; but is a very painful read and a great disappointment 
 My daughters (ages 6 and 8) pleaded with me for Tuscan 2% Milk for Christmas.  I ordered two gallons nearly a week ago and they did not arrive on time.  The girls were heartbroken.  And how embarrassing to have to leave a cup of water and cookies for Santa.  
 This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played.   "Eight Women" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. "Eight Women" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.  Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.  By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience. 
 I have been an avid Daphne du Maurier fan for 30 years. I had never read this book until a couple of weeks ago. I found it very disappointing and boring. Her books usually have that "du Maurier" feel to them, but not so in this case. She was a brilliant writer but this did not grab me at all. Her last novel 
 The debate here over whether the ancient Egyptions were "black" is confounded by white supremacist myth both in the book and in the reviews. "Race" is an ideological category emanating from white supremacist rationalizations for European colonialism and violence. There are no black or white "races," only various ways of imagining people to be "white" or "black."   People here are saying that ancient Egyptions were not "black" or "negroid" because they depicted themselves as medium brown in contrast to dark brown neighbors to the South. But white supremacist ideology has defined "black" according to the "one-drop rule."  Still today in the US if you have any visible African ancestry you are "black" no matter how light or otherwise European you may be.  Isn't it interesting that, when it comes to debate over ancient Africans of Egypt, suddenly we have the one-drop rule in reverse; and if you are not of the darkest brown hue or the most stereotypic "black" features, then you are not "black" or "negroid."  Conversely, millions of people in Northern Africa who are not defined through this racist double-standard as being part of so-called "black Africa" would be, and are, considered "black" if and when they come to the US, as are millions of so-called "middle-eastern" people. How convenient! This double standard is not a product of logic or Nature but of White supremacist ideology. I am sorry but You cannot have your cake and eat it too!  The more important question not addressed by the book is why some people have such a desperate need to separate Egypt from Africa and darker skinned Africans.  If lighter-skinned Europeans and their descendents get to claim and glory in their imagined connection to ancient Greece, why on earth shouldn't darker skinned Africans and their descendents get to claim and glory in their continental connection to Ancient Egypt. Eurocentric myth is far more dangerous and has been far more deadly than Afrocentic myth will ever be. That is what we need to talk about.    
 I am an avid reader, but I barely wanted to even finish this book.    I was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, and I don't think this book gives him enough credit.  I don't like the writer's style: his logic is difficult to follow sometimes, and he goes off on tangents instead of focusing on Reagan.  He describes Reagan as a President that no one liked; this is NOT true!!   Furthermore, I don't care for some of his (the author's) biased viewpoints that he threw in, like about the Vietnam War; they have no place in a book that is discussing the Life of Reagan.  
 Walter Mosley, like too many mainstream and mystery writers, appears to believe that "science fiction" means "logic and plausibility get tossed out the window." That the official Amazon.com review compares this book to the work of Philip K. Dick is amazing and wrong-headed; Dick knew how to ground his surrealism in the real world and especially in real human beings. Whatever Mr. Mosley does in his mysteries and mainstream fiction, that's not what he's doing here 
 My wife and I have now spent a good month "learning" with this book. In fact more than 10 minutes a day,  more like 30 minutes per session. We both speak other languages, so we can compare.  GOOD, nice thematic picture groups,  and you need to learn the words associated with them.  (We did.)  BAD, again, and again Ms. Kershul introduces words,  and grammar which do not fit into the "just mastered"  scheme of things.  IRRITATING to the extreme: Ms. Kershul gives her instructions in a mixture of English  and Italian in one sentence.  (We would have preferred one line of Italian ONLY,  followed by one line --say in italics--  providing the English translation, in many cases preferably, with an explanations "how this compares to what was done yesterday".)  BAD: In attempt to NOT introduce grammar, you are left high  and dry figuring out gender, declinations, and worse conjugations by yourself.  (We have not yet seen satisfactory forms summarizing 'things',  and we are half way through the book).  In anger, we finally went to the local library  and got a 70 years old Italian grammar for High Schools.  That did solve our problem and left us convinced that "new and improved" does not necessarily  provide a better learning experience.  Somewhat IRRITATING:  Ms Kershuls's choice of vocabulary seems to assume that 1. you wish to visit lots of relatives  (not an uncle, niece, grandson, cousin, grandparent, or daughter  is forgotten in the family tree),  2. you wish to order meals and "buy stuff" constantly (we assure you, that is the one thing Italians are very good at, understanding English when you want to  buy things or order a meal)  3. you wish to tell Italians that you are "American"  (as if our accents and clothing are not dead-give-aways)  4. you pray "catholic", "protestant", or "Hebrew".  (the Italians we know couldn't care less -- how about instead "politics", "music", "movies", "soccer"  and the "bella ragazza" over there)  In summary, we are ready now to look for a book which does not claim to be "easy, in 10 minutes a day",  but emphasizes grammar,  groups vocabulary (and discusses alternatives for each new word),   provides clearer indication of emphasis in the pronounciation (example: telEfono, versus incorrect tElefono) Teaches Italian as a language of "constructed" full sentences, rather than "single catch words". ------------------  Our final test,  No, we would not recommend this book to a friend 
 One of the challenges Don Colbert faced in writing the What Would Jesus Eat Cookbook is whether the book should focus on the foods Jesus did eat in Judea 2000 years ago or on the foods Jesus would eat were He transported to 21st century America. Colbert doesn't seem to have decided which way he wanted to go, possibly because he doesn't quite seem to understand where he was coming from.   A great deal of controversy has been stirred up by Colbert's claims that following the Mosaic laws is healthier than following the standard Western diet. Colbert does not claim that the laws forbidding the consumption of pork, seafood and other foods and food combinations still apply; his premise is simply that following the dietary laws that Jesus did, and eating the foods He would have eaten during His lifetime, is healthier than following our modern diet. However, this premise is undercut by the inclusion of ingredients in well over half the recipes which are completely foreign to the ancient Mediterranean. No Judean (or Roman, for that matter) would have recognized New World foods such as tomatoes, potatoes, hot peppers, and squash or Far Eastern foods such as edameme and soy sauce, yet one or more of these ingredients can be found in over half the recipes. What's more, many of the foods and condiments enjoyed in the Holy Land at the time - fish sauce, lovage, wild mushrooms, and above all wine - are never mentioned, let alone included in a recipe.   But the main criticism I have of this book is its premise. Colbert seems to subscribe to the idea that ancient people were somehow healthier than we moderns, and that our poor diet is the main reason. This is, to be blunt, absolutely false. When Jesus died at age 33, He had lived a longer life than the vast majority of His countrymen. The average age at death under Imperial rule for those who survived childhood was a short 20 years. Those living in Roman-occupied territories tended to be desperately poor by our standards, able to afford little more than whole grain porridge seasoned with fish sauce and supplemented with whatever herbs and mushrooms could be found growing wild. Few could afford fresh vegetables and fruits; beef was virtually unattainable (and not, as Colbert says, eaten once a month) because cattle were needed as draft animals. Fish, a delicacy, was far too expensive for most. The only readily available protein sources were beans and lentils - incomplete and bland. Epidemics carried away far more Judeans than Romans simply because the Romans ate better - more protein, more calcium, more calories.   As for the recipes: I tried four or five, but I was not impressed. Many recipes are simply retreads of modern Mediterranean cooking - incidentally, nothing like ancient Mediterranean cooking - and others seem to have been lifted from the pages of a 1970s hippy cookbook. The blueberry potato salad was literally inedible, the hummus smelled and tasted awful, and the soups were somehow both overspiced and underflavoured.  This book fails in all ways: it doesn't provide a look into the foods Jesus and His followers would have enjoyed, it doesn't make the case for Colbert's version of healthy eating, and it doesn't contain many appetizing recipes 
 The rule book is pretty straight foward and easy to use but useless because of its self destructing binding. Open the book fully to a page and you're likely to lose that page as it separates from the "stick-um" type binding. This is not the handy reference guide you'd like to pack in your team bag for frequent inquiries. [....]Better still, buy a rule book in a book store where you can hold it, flip through the pages and imagine it holding up through many challenging game situations 
 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
 I found the wallet to be cheap looking and MUCH smaller than the picture lead me to believe.  To call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product.  This is more of an insert to a wallet, consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket.  I wasn't pleased with the purchased, expecting quite a bit more the $14 I spent.  I can go to Target and get a wallet for less that what I paid for this one and it will be a FULL wallet, not a sorry wannabe 
 While wearing more than one color at a time may have been considered risque in the author's time, wearing black and brown together is no longer the scandal she claims it was.   There are some useful points in this little book, but the author's continued insistence that one wear beige and wool (even in the summer!) quickly becomes tedious (particularly to those of us who, due to allergies and skin conditions, cannot wear wool under any circumstances).  And given the English penchant for dressing frumpily, it is a wonder why she continues to refer to the English as masters of taste.  The sad truth about any book like this (and this is no reflection on this book or the author) is that those who need to read it the most (the deliberately shabby and poorly groomed) are the least likely to read it 
 The title of the book is "How to get a job with a cruise line". However this is NOT at all what the author is talking about. The book is full with mainly autobiographical stories, which don't give any insider information. These people have had a hired relative, nearby office of a cruise line, 14 years experience or something similar. This makes them useless for the typical applicants who have to rely entirely on the quality of their cover letter and resumes. With only few pages mainly common sense tips on writing and applying this book can only tell you what is onboard BUT NOT and how to get there 
 This book has beautiful pictures and some nice ideas and designs -- if you can figure out what the writer is talking about. Extremely confusing instructions and diagrams. I bought this book to learn the right angle weave, but it is useless for that purpose. Too bad, it had some real potential 
 VERBOSITY, n. the employment of a superabundance of words; the use of more words than are necessary  This probably describes all this author's works. I had a terrible time wading through his bio on W.C. Fields and had to skip over most of it. I disposed of that book as soon as I was finished with it. When I got this book out of the library I had fogotten all about the author. But when I started reading "Stan and Ollie" I quickly looked at the cover and cried, "oh, no!."  I made it through almost three chapters before giving up.  Yet, I am a person who loves to read how an author weaves words together. That is part of the pleasure of a book. But this author doesn't weave, he just pours!  This book could be a third of its length and do its subjects far better justic 
 Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead 
 Any reviewer who finds a smidgeon of merit in this crazy excuse for rational thought needs to have his own head examined.  Bigots and fascists are always looking for some sort of intellectual basis for their beliefs and have for 70 or 80 years tried attempted to find it in Rosenberg's tortured and barren prose (along with Hitler's equally crazy "Mein Kampf").  Albert Speer, an intelligent and broadly educated man who was Hitler's architect, close associate, and armaments minister, declared the book "unreadable" (see "Inside the Third Reich," a vastly more worthwhile book).  Anyone who wants to see what this kind of thinking, when adopted on a large scale, can ultimately lead to should watch "Schindler's List. 
 This is the WORST transfer to DVD I've ever seen!!! I think the VHS copy looks and sounds better, do NOT waste your money!! 
 This book tells you what you already knew - clean, declutter, fix broken stuff, and clean up the yard.  That's about it.  The reason the book is more than ten pages long is that it is chock full of the author's stories about how wonderful she is and what a staging pioneer she is.  I really wish I hadn't wasted my money on this fluffy piece of advertising 
 After reading the reviews of this book I thought this might be someone with a different perspective who might challenge his readers to think outside themselves. Sadly the author himself did not do this, much less posses a grasp of the material that would cause you to stop and think, pondering a deep thought through a new point of view. Instead you are accosted by the shallow attempt of an intelligent man to address the spiritual through the half open eyes of humanity. It is not a book for the serious minded who are trying to work through the topics presented, but a laughable ramble through the same old ideas presented in a better format. That is the strength of this book, and even in that it falters. He tries to present each topic in a refreshing manner, but in almost every chapter he goes off on some unrelated tangent never to answer the question presented. The times he does try to answer the question, he does not come to the question with a desire to seek the truth, but with a preconceived ideas that would require him to come to the same conclusion that he was taught.  You would be better served doing the following. Study the scriptures. Then ask yourself what preconceived idea you brought to a topic. Acknowledge your bias and look at the topic again from your new starting point. Repeat this process until you have removed all of what you and society have wrapped around the topic. When all the preconceive ideas and piously held ideals are removed you will be faced with what is left, the truth. Skip this book. Read the real one. 
 Wuthering Heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion, betrayal, madness, despair, greed, hatred, and revenge. It's not necessarily a pleasant read, but always an engrossing one. Emily Bronte's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you've finished the book.   Modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the Bronte sisters' works into film and this is no exception. The characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book. Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today, but this movie is a definite low point for both.    As Heathcliff and Catherine, Fiennes and Binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland. Binoche's personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree Cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves. Fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul; he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role. The other characters are likewise lacking in realism, only Janet McTeer fares well, she is fabulous as Ellen Dean.   Even if the acting were better, the story does not capture the essence of the book. Everything moves too quickly, the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words. Sinead O'Conner's appearance as Emily Bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary.  This film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it. The wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part, ugly and unflattering. Fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests!   Maybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice. This isn't it 
 Salty and frank.....is how an editorial review described DeBeauvoir's story and writing style. I came to the book feeling that a treatise on intellectual life in post WWII Paris would serve me well in regards to  expanding my own knowledge in modern theory.  And it did.  I appreciate the  seemingly unabashed look into some of the proposed great thinkers of our  century.  The intermittent sections of the novel concerning Anne's affair  with Lewis, an American writer, however, made the novel come to grinding  halts for me.  The writing in these sections read like a dime store  romance.  I sensed DeBeauvoir rushed through these scenes, cram-packing the  volatile emotions of the love affair, into prose that sadly negated the  brilliance I saw in other sections of the novel.  When the story picked  back up in Paris, I, too, continued my interest in the story.  But when she  again returned to the American scenes with Lewis, I found myself saying,  Simone...! What's wrong?  What are you doing? I'm fairly sure the character  of Lewis was adapted from a real person, although I don't know his  identity.  I thought after finishing the book that it is very hard, indeed,  to write about the people / scenes of our lives that are most emotionally  sensitive to us.  As a poet and artist, I've yet to create anything that is  STRICTLY autobiographical that I've found up to par with the emotional  content the subjects evoke.  I wonder if this wasn't the case with  DeBeauvoir.  I do, however, resepct the book.  It's hard for me not to  admire the intelligence I do see in a great deal of DeBeauvoir's writing 
 And, if this is an illustration of the "joy" of writing sex, I would hate to see an illustration of the "horror" or writing sex.  One of the short-shorts in the version I purchased of this book details the experience of a male gas station clerk being highly aroused when another male enters his gas station and rapes him in the back room. Is this a sex scene worthy of a story to be sold as literature, or is it a transcribed version of something someone saw at a pay site on the Internet? Do we really want to be sending a message to the public that rape is an acceptable, exciting form of sexual intercourse? I can think of several victims I know who would not appreciate that, one of whom was killed by her attacker 
 I found the information in this book extensive, but for experienced Internet investigative P.I.'s this book is redundant.  Just for a test I sampled some items in the book and they were on the Interent, and easily found with keyword searches.  It was also lacking good information on computer forensics investigator contacts, and how they support general practice PI's.  "Digital Evidence" IS THE problem for the PI in the 21st Century.  
 Shallow characters, plot uninteresting, interactions not convincing at all. In my eyes, Kellerman's best trait has been always the depiction of the anti-urban American landscape and way of life. His detective plots (decent at most) were just the vehicle fot this depiction. But in this novel not even that subproduct is achieved. As some other reader pointed out, the novel is little more than a series of "drove there-wore this-ate that" sequences that leave us wanting. Stephen Cannel plus clothing descriptions 
 I had high hopes for this, but three major flaws contributed to it being returned:  1) The display is extremely bright. I ended up covering it with a t-shirt, just to be able to get to sleep. 2) Even though bright, the display cannot be read unless you are close and at the correct angle. 3) The sounds quality was surprisingly bad. I knew this wasn't a fancy, expensive model, but the sound was unbearably distorted, especially at lower volumes (e.g. you want your ipod music on in the background). I though my ipod battery was dead at first, but apparently the speakers on this unit are just that bad.  So it fails as a clock, and as an iPod player. I never tried the radio function, but even if that was excellent it would not have saved the product from being returned 
 I had owned a pair of Sketchers a few years back and was happy with the brand then.  When I got these shoes I was surprised to see that they were not to the quality standards that I remembered.  I like lace-less shoes, but these were not adjustable, so for my narrow foot they didn't fit and they were still hard to get on.  I decided to send them back within 10 min 
 I bought a new PC last week and maxed it out with a gig of ram and 512 video card...Vista was preinstalled...  These are the basic specs of the PC I have:  AThlon 64 X2 dual core processor 2 Gig memory DDR 2 250 SATA HDD  not only did this thing run slow...I found out that a lot of my old software wouldn't work...what gives????  I ran Company of Heroes (seemingly a surefire bet considering the upgrades) and that crawles like I was trying to run this on a minimum spec'ed machine...and mind u I bought this new AND did upgrades (an extra 250 dollars worth) so I wound up spending a nice part of Saturday reformatting the HDD and putting XP back on my machine and viola! I really get to see whta kind of power I am working with...  for those of you thinking about going back to XP, do it and wait until Vista gets figured out...it's 250 dollar resource hog and it won't be on my machine for a little while...and while u are at it...please be sure to back up your drivers files... 
 The two most slanted news organizations on our planet.  Don't forget CNN had their own Baghdad bureau before the war.  The only people recommending this book are al-Qaida supporters.  Sad, but true.  
 After witnessing a sweet performance and sweeter song on television's Ally McBeal, I had such high hopes for this CD.  But a testosterone clone of the robot Charlotte Church was not on my agenda.  Turgid ballads, irritating arias, a monotone baritone, and a misguided remake of "Vincent [Starry Starry Night]"; you have to wonder just who is responsible for all this.  Then you notice roll call - David Foster, Walter Afanasieff, Richard Marx...then it all makes sense.  My grade:   
 The actual rating is MINUS 5 stars. This book sucks. The stupid CD DOES NOT WORK on PC. Finally I copied it from my Mac. More surprises. Some chapters, IMPORTANT ONES, ARE MISSING. Without completing these chapters, you can't move on. I am throwing my book away in disgust. I'm heading out to buy a book that actually works. People who can't even program their own CDs shoudn't write "How to" manuals 
 This book does have good aspects: the 'content-out' approach Andy Clarke takes, the sneak peak into CCS3 features, and the recommendations for looking at other media and the real world for inspiration. However, it is very poorly edited and contains some bad mistakes. For example: traditionally, when presenting code, newly added lines are bolded. In this book, it is often done incompletely or incorrectly, or lines are left out of the code altogether (check out page 161). Also, one gets the feeling that the good parts of the book could have been condensed down into a more affordable and much smaller book or even a pamphlet. Lastly, some items go underexplained. For example, when introducing the use of attribute selectors, Clarke uses examples such as li[id="cake"], which makes no sense at all, because it still requires an id to be applied in the markup, and actually uses more characters than li#cake. More importantly, though, it does not get to the heart of when and why attribute selectors can be so useful.  In the end, I'd recommend waiting till you can get a cheap used copy of this book, read it, and pass it on 
 As much as I loved the features and music from Bruces' 30th anniv. Born to Run package, I disliked Devils & Dust. I am about 2 weeks older than Mr.Springsteen and have most of his music, seen him preform 6 times. the last in early 2002. I enjoyed the acoustic parts of the concert and the RIsing cd very much. But this one excapes me and doesn't touch what I love about his lyricism, use of instrumentation, and ability to put simple concepts into complex settings, or complex feelings into simple yet elegant lyrics...on Devils he puts highly personal and obscure messages into obscure settings. I wish for more poetry as found on his first three albums and tunnel of love. I hope others will find these songs more personal to them, I just can't find my way into them, didn't like Nebraska or Tom  Joad either. sorry, Bruce... seado 
 What an awful book!   The authors trade in the richness and fullness of the Old Testament for not only the dullest of boring textbooks, but they weave into being a God that doesn't believe in sin.  Humans make mistakes because they are maturing which is okay, because God makes them too!  The Christology foreshawdowed throughout the Old Testament is "creative remembering" on the part of Christians - NOT REALLY THERE AT ALL - according to these scholors.  All of this leads to salvation being an act of social justice rather than Christ's atonement for sin.  They should have titled this book: "Watch us as we try to castrate God!"  Geepers guys.  Is this the sum total of all of your careers? What a waste 
 travelled through Ethiopia with this guidebook and was very disappointed. The accomodation references are poor (better ask a cab driver), so are the historical descriptions. Also (but this is an LP thing) it's good for people who like to be told by the authors what you are supposed to see, if you like other things you have to ignore the author's comments at all costs 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations 
 Another movie using actresses seemingly straight out of soft porn. It's fun to watch them die onscreen sure, but it's redundant. I'm not surprised to read it's by the Shark Attack people. They're terrible too, but of course if they make a #4, I will rent it knowing it will be stupid. <sigh&gt 
 I agree with most of the negative reviewers about this, especially the one who pointed out that there were no "Mysteries". The criticisms are quite accurate: the tone is glib, condescending and jocular, what could be called Best Seller/talk show host prose: nothing too strenuous or meaningful. Bill Maher does the High Middle Ages. This is certainly the prevalent view: "nowadays, we know all about it". There is no sense of humility before a subject no one human could possibly understand nor of the feelings evoked by the great works of art of the era, compared to which the 20th century had very little.   
 While the Sonic Foundry manuals have usually been sparse in details, this "instant" book comes with even less info.  If you need a book to hold your hand and explain things like: Custom Workspace... You can choose the toolbars you want to see.  Choose View.Toolbars (that's it), then this may be the book for you. But then the manual will tell you more than that.  For the Spectrum Analysis Tools there are just barely 100 words to cover the entire subject.  My copy is on the way back.  No more CMP Books for me 
 So, the author doesn't like Walmart selling decent merchandise at decent prices? I could tell that before I read this book. The 20 dollar price tag for a 160-page paperback book gave it away 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 Make sure you read the great chapter on quitting when things aren't going your way, only taking positions that are guaranteed to succeed and quitting on those who show faith and loyalty to you 
 Let's try to imagine something you'd want to learn from your Southern Spain guidebook once you get there. How to pronounce Spanish? Sorry, the glossary in the back has no pronunciation guide, just glosses every word in the Spanish spelling. Oddly enough, although they don't tell you how to pronounce each letter, they tell you how each is spelled in the Spanish language.  Hmm, what else? Whether or not to tip your taxi-driver on the way home from the airport? Nope, sorry. There are two entries on taxicabs, neither of which mention that you don't tip.  Siestas? Southern Spain is full of siestas. They have them every day. The times vary between regions, though, and you should really know when they are because you won't be able to access food or drink or some attractions during the siesta. This book doesn't mention them. AT ALL. This is an appalling omission.  The maps for the various cities aren't even a page big, making them utterly useless. The book itself, because it is inexplicably printed on heavy glossy paper (this book is really into the fact that it has several full-page photo spreads to help you get 'into the mood,'), weighs more than anything else I brought with me on vacation. It was so heavy that I had to ditch it on a day-long trip to Granada. Needless to say, it was not missed.  If you buy this book, you're an idiot 
 Obviously many people loved this show (it's premature demise making them cling all the more dearly to it). If you've aleady seen the show land like it (or love it), skip this review. There are plenty of glowing reviews that will confirm you opinions.  I came to the how as a fan of the Simpsons and it's many offspring. Reading all the above-mentioned positive reviews made me--a sucker for anything touted as a lost classic--think I'd missed something great in the 1990s.   The one positive thing I can say about the show is that the animation backgrounds are done with a unique and impressionistic flair. I can't say the same about the character designs or the fluidity of motion, but the backgrounds are nice and worth noticing.  But the writing...it's mediocre. I found the humor less subtle than South Park and Beavis and Butthead, to say nothing of the Simpsons and Family Guy. It's not that this is a crude show ('Beavis' and 'Southpark' are more than simply crude), it's just that the jokes are obvious most of the time. And they are never followed up with additional twists they way that can happen with the Simpsons.  The supporting characters (including Doris the makeup lady; the redneck boss guy; the Crocodile Dundee-esqe Australian pretty-boy actor) almost collapse under the weight of the stereotypical behavior, accents and punchlines they labor under. (I'll make an exception for Jay's uber-WASP father, who kind of foreshadows Lois of the Family Guy's parents.)  The best moments are the send-ups of Hollywood flicks that Jay critiques, but these are much too few and far between. I made it through disc one, and when on the first episode of disc two they couldn't even make Los Angeles seem funny, I gave up. Sitting through these things with half a smile on your face hoping for just one or two funny moments isn't worth your time. Some episodes, the funny moments never came. Maybe it got better later on. But it seemed too much like work to me to keep watching this stuff 
 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die could be a great film guide. It is loaded with both well-known and obscure films, many of which I have sought out and enjoyed after reading about them in the book. I've really started to enjoy noir films because of this book's recommendations.  The fatal flaw in 1001 Movies is that they frequently give away the endings! For example, they often tell you when an important character dies at the end of the movie -- what is the point of that? Look for a different guide that doesn't spoil the endings 
 When I received these slim cd/dvd 5mm cases 25% where damaged in shipment. Some broke when I opened them. They are too thin to hold up for very long.  I will never buy them again 
 We purchased this stroller because of the weight (10lbs) ease of lifting it/out of the car. Two weeks after purchasing the stroller we noticed that the stitching on the sun shade was already coming apart. The shade is barely big enough to shield anything, let alone provide protection for the child. We received a replacement cover, but was advised that this would be a one time replacement. The tiny cup holder that was not big enough to hold a bottle has already broken off. Our 8 mo. old is 17 lbs. and the stroller is very difficult to maneuver. For straight paths, great. If you have to take a turn or change direction quickly, do NOT plan on having the stroller transition with your directional shift. The front wheels get stuck and you have to kick them back forward or the stroller will not steer correctly when you are going straight. Having had a Pliko previously for my 4 yr old, we thought we could trust the name of Peg Perego. Unless you are seeking a light weight stroller that does not maneuver well, we woud not recommend this stroller to anyone.  
 Dated, biased account of what happened at PARC and at Xerox headquarters. Very out of date, especially given PARC's foresight in terms of  distributed, connected computers. It seems like the authors decided to bash  Xerox even before they began their research. Save your money on this one. A  better bet is "Dealers of Lightning" by Michael Hiltzik. That one  points out what Xerox did wrong, and, oh, by the way, what they did right.  (For example, make a couple of billion dollars out of the Laser Print  industry.) The authors of this one just seemed to have it "in"  for Xerox. I wonder if they used a windows based PC or Mac to type the  original manuscript? Not without PARC, they wouldn't have 
 Don't waste your time.  I bought these for a birthday gift for my mother because they matched her bathroom perfectly.  Believe it or not, her bday was december 12th.  They still haven't even been shipped.  Don't waste your time it's not worth it 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 I have read Schoenfeld's book in an attempt to understand where and how anti-semitism sits within today's society, as part of some research work I have been conducting.  To be honest the book has disapointed me greatly. I have found the book full of half truths, missing counter points, which I feel completely insults the intelligence of the reader, assuming they have never performed any winder reading on the subject of the position of judaism and israel within today's world. In fact Schoenfeld takes the un forgivable position of actually wanting us to confuse anti-semitism with feeling against israel's political position.  For example, on page  29 Sheonfeld tells us, without any references that Palestine was nothing but sand and swap before the arrival of israel (already he is asking to consider anti-semitism along side the issue of palestine and israel). In these remarks he shows either his lack of research, or his desire to lie about the history of Palestine. We just need to look at the poster of franz krauz or look at books such as "Before their diaspora: A photographic history of the Palestinians, 1876-1948 (Unknown Binding) by Walid Khalidi" to see this is just not true.  Nowhere in the book does Sheonfeld address the anger people have towards the way israel has acted to it's neighbours, or the propoganda machine that tries to deny and rebrand the 1996 massacre at the Qana UN post. In fact it seems he doesnt care about exaplaining the reason why people may be ant-semtic/anti israeli, he just wants to cite and fabricate incidents of it.  This book seems to address more the rise of anti-arabism, and seeks to promote it. I would recommend this book only to people wishing to journey into the worrying fantasies of a very racist individual 
 This was so stupid. Intelligent sharks that swim in schools terrorize a local tourist beach community. Complete with direct rip-0ffs from "Jaws," and combined footage of real sharks with plastic and inflatable toy sharks. Also the shark thinks it's a lion as it growls before and during attacks. People underwater with scuba gear can talk, and scream easily too..Hmmmm..LOL..If you like bad films, you might wanna see how stupid and cheap this is. There is plenty nof unintentional humor here. But I cannot give it any better than 1 star. Because that's what it is. A one star mega low budget film. Bad actors. Bad script. Bad director. Bad special effects. But if you hate bad movies, stay away... Truly for lovers of below "B" grade films only 
 Having been born in '86, I unfortunately did not yet exist to experience the late '70's punk movement or was too young to be part of the '80's hardcore years. Instead, I got to grow up with the MTV generation.... how so very lucky I am. Yet, I figured out the difference between real music and the junk mainstream media keeps referring to as "punk". So, if I could figure it out, any other idiot from this forsaken generation shouldn't have any problems. Good Charlotte is okay if you're 8 years old, but if you're 13 and you're still listening them you need to just grow up and listen to much better stuff. If you're my age and you listen to Good Charlotte then you are beyond any help.  Instead of Good Charlotte, buy or steal the real thing: Subhumans:Time Flies + Rats. It was the first one I picked up and it led to an entire collection of real, gritty, raw punk music. To all the Good Charlotte fans, take the advice I just gave you. Go from whining about how much your life sucks to actually doing something about it. 
 The problem with this book is that it fails on every genere it's trying to work. It's a lousy science fiction novel, a non-erotic erotic novel and an unromantic romance novel.   Look, if the erotic writing was at least detailed enough to arouse then it could be lumped in with Spaceways and have done with it. But it fails. It's all description of skimpy outfits and cuts to the next scene.   As for adventure Even Spaceways had more action, heck, even The Alien Trace (an eroto-sci-fi work in the 80s) beats this.   I don't know why a sequel was published, but I hope somebody sat down with the author and said:  "These are your choices: read a few penthouse letters and do better with the erotica, read science fiction and try to be original, or go actually have sex or an adventure so you can write about both or either with some authenticity"  Do not buy this book.   
 A much better and concise book on this topic is called "The Great Bust Ahead".  Authored by Daniel Arnold, it provides much more statistical data for an up-coming crash / depression.  It's not the 70.5 year olds withdrawing from their 401k's which will cause a crash, it's the 49-54 year old spending age bracket which are heading into retirement.  Arnold is predicting a much earlier crash to occur around 2010.  I highly recommend his book.  It's a short read and will only take about an hour; but is well worth it 
 This product stinks.  Typically, the documentation is not written in standard English, but in some cyber-patois that no civilized person understands.  Their support material is exhaustive and exhausting and solves no user problem.  I bought it primarily for book reading and, so far, have not been able to access a single one.  The "desktop manager" tells me the "synchronization" went ok, but that proves to be false.  The stories I downloaded are nowhere to be found.  I look under Franklin Reader and find nothing.  I look under Mobi Reader and find the same.  I don't need another calculator, or memo book, or solitaire game, or voice recorder, or mp3 player, or phone book.  I wanted a portable library for fiction, nonfiction, whatever, and this gadget will not give it to me.  If you remember the Seinfeld episode in which the foreign professor threw the electronic organizer out the window, you have an idea of what I feel like doing with this thing.  I bought it from a clearance company on ebay for 50 bucks, so it's not a huge loss.  But I did want an ebook reader.  Apparently, there are a lot of ebooks online for the taking (or buying), but I'll never see them, not with the Franklin ebookman anyway.  And I'm certainly not going in search of another device.  Once burned, twice shy 
 This is an interesting book and the drawings are lovely. However, you don't know what you are looking at since the explanation plates are way way too tiny to read. You'd have to take the pages and blow them up to read what is drawn. Instead of 4 plates to a page how about each plate to a page. Don't buy if you are trying learn about the horse because you can't read the tiny tiny print. 
 Blargh. Green Mars took a long long time to finish.  I'm talking months. Painful, depressing months, in which I would pick it off the little wall-shelf thing above my toilet, read a chapter or two while tending to my business, sigh, and put it back.  Why? Simple. Red Mars was fun, because it was a proper sci fi book, with the additional colonial political bits. Green Mars is 90% politics/talking about a revolution, and maybe 10% proper sci fi.   In short: Take a good idea, then write a sequel and make it suck. No fun here. At least, by the time Robinson started with his political-environmental social responsibility of the scientists babbling in The Years of Rice and Salt, he'd already written a thousand years of cool alternative history, so it wasn't so painful.  I dread the concept of starting Blue Mars, even though its sitting on my bookshelf right next to Red and Green. 
 Total rubbish. Wood was scratched on top, corner was smashed, water damage on the shelf, and door was cracked. It is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use. The holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together. Extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control. To add salt in the wound, the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and I had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it. If you like taking chances and do still want to buy it, it's probably a 50-50 chance that it will be damaged. 
 I purchased this based on the numerous reviews here and glowing recommendations elsewhere online, but it has turned out to be the poorest choice and truly the most useless book on drawing I've ever read.  I wish I hadn't ignored the fact that others commented about nearly everything except actual drawing instruction.  I wish my mind had registered the key words analysis and theory in so many others glowing reviews.  If you want to learn to draw, or learn to actually apply lines, mass, tone, balance, proportion, etc. to improve your drawing skills then look elsewhere.  However, if you want to read one author's horribly long winded rambling lectures about how these things influence art, perception, and the psyche then this is the book for you.  This is far more an analysis of drawing as it relates to art than it is a tutorial.  Nearly three hundred pages and you could compress the portions related to applying these ideas to your own drawing down to two dozen pages at most 
 I had never heard of this author before and picked this book on cd up at the library. It moved at a snails pace, the book jacket made it sound like an inriuging mystery - but more time is spent on analyzing every last detail amongst the characters - finally when something does happen by the 8th cd - its anticlimactic. And althought he main character continually talks about being psychic - she never once has a premonition, other than feeling "spiderwebs" when she walks in a room.  I couldn't wait for this book to end, and I will probably never pick up another book by this author, even though other reviewers say she writes good books. I kept wondering if it would be better, if someone who was not monotone was doing the reading on the cd. That didn't help matters. 
 Succinctly put, this is probably the worst science fiction book I've read, and I've read a lot of them. I'll go point by point:  1: The idea. Some may call this novel "innovative," but that is most certainly a misuse of the word. The main idea of this book is that "incest" as we now use this word is ok as long as it either 1) genetically harmless; 2) failing the first condition, does not produce babies. Incest and other such "alternative family relationships," as another reviewer so mildly put it, is not a new idea at all. Now, I am not close minded to anything, but the sort of self-serving and constant glorification of what is ultimately a bad idea even biologically speaking that Heinlein subjects his readers too is boring, unimaginative, uninformative, and frankly morbid.  2: The plot. Nonexistent. There is no dynamic to the story. Heinlen meanders from one time-frame to another with no logic to tie them all up. There is an interesting story here and there, but they serve no meaningful purpose, except to, again, glorify (and not simply justify) "alternative family relationships."  3: The characters. I haven't found any. At least none that were really interesting. There is Lazarus, who is basically a sleazeball who is rules by his two cardinal instincts entirely: survival and reproduction. There are women, who are uniformely and without exception ruled by only one of those two instincts: reproduction. Others in the book are basically filler material.  4: The writing. Atrocious. Heinlein puts too much faith in dialogue. I say too much because he can't write it. All dialogues are protracted and artificial, they are never to a point, and they all sound alike. The last point bears repeating: you can almost never tell whose speech you are reading, except when 1) someone says they want Lazarus' baby (this happens often and it's a clue that a female character must be speaking) or 2) someone reminisces about the days of yore (that's a clue to Lazarus). But the style of the speech is the same for everyone.  5. The science fiction. Nonexistent. There are references to "rejuvenation," "time travel," and space colonization. But that's about as far as we get. There is absolutely no elaboration on how, for instance, a ten-fold increase in lifespan would have affected the reproductive choices of humanity. This is particulaly puzzling since all characters in the story are of such extraordinary verility. Put two and two together: if all women have babies every year or so, and all of those babies live for a thousand years each, how long will it take you to overpopulate a planet? The answer is: hardly any time at all. Yet Heinlein never pauses to explain how the economies of his worlds continue to function and never stops to elaborate on the causes of social collapses that do happen from time to time.   Last thing. Why did I spend all this time writing a review. Because I find it troubling that so many give this book 5-stars. This is not a worthwile read. If you are interested in romance novels, go to a different section: Heinlein is probably not the best in that genre. If you are interested in science fiction with well-developed ideas and good fiction, pick up Asimov, Greg Bear, Stephen Baxter (bad writing but great science), John C. Wright, Will McCarthy, or Vernor Vinge 
 The majority of my cases were damaged in shipping. I immediately threw away about eight, but as I tried to use the rest I gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well. Maybe I'm alone, given the other high ratings, but these seem more fragile than other slim cases I've used in the past. I'd give them 3-stars (because they're cheap) if they didn't have to be shipped.   
 A Critical Response to Strangers in the Land: Blacks, Jews, Post-Holocaust America       Since I began intensively studying the Israel-Palestine conflict nine years ago, I have (as a Jew) also been concerned with its historical and current effect on relations among blacks and Jews in this country. These relations have reflected the influence that neoconservatism, originating primarily among Jewish intellectuals, has had on mainstream (liberal) Jewish institutional life and political culture in America, and the manner in which Jewish-identified aspects of neoconservatism (opposition to affirmative action, support for Israel, an obsession with alleged anti-Semitism and now "Islamo-fascism") have been adopted by a broader culture of white racism and class privilege, with obvious dire effects both domestically and globally. What began as one aspect of the white ethnic intellectual backlash in the 1960s has evolved, been appropriated, and become central to the domestically ruthless and globally violent ideology of the current administration, with a concurrent black-Jewish subplot that has been much discussed but not adequately understood.  	It is in this context that I was intrigued to discover a massive 527-page work of scholarship called Strangers in the Land: Blacks, Jews, Post-Holocaust America by UCLA English professor Eric Sundquist (Belknap-Harvard, 2005). Upon obtaining this book, however, I was quickly disappointed to find-in spite of many insightful analyses of literary works-a clear unwillingness to seriously engage the central issues noted above. While I will leave it to others to judge whether Strangers in the Land succeeds as a work of cultural/literary criticism, I would suggest that it is an utter and insidious failure of political criticism. Moreover, I think that it is as a work of political criticism that it will be (and should be) primarily received. As such, this book stands as an apology for neoconservatism and its support for white privilege in America, as well as its support for the Zionist project in all its aggressive criminality, now coming to a head as any possibility of viable Palestinian state is being destroyed. In this context, Sundquist shows a marked lack of compassion for the dire plight of the Palestinian people, and-given his obviously considerable scholarly skills-demonstrates a seemingly willful innocence of the implications of historical scholarship, human rights reports, and diplomatic records now freely available, most recently summarized by Norman Finkelstein.  	In summary, Sundquist views neoconservatism as rather benignly emanating in the 1960s from liberal Jewish intellectuals understandably caught amongst a dedication to the meritocracy, Jewish group interests, and the threatening demands of what he sees as anti-Zionist and incipiently anti-Semitic advocates of Black Power. Sundquist reduces Black Nationalist, Black Power, Pan-African, and Third World Liberation movements, and specifically the leadership of Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael, to demagogic, venal, anti-Semitic opportunism and bigotry. Sundquist adopts a boilerplate Zionist narrative of the history of Palestine and Israel that would not pass muster in any college classroom worth its name, which romanticizes Israelis and denigrates Palestinians. While maintaining a scholarly tone and engaging in prodigious amounts of research, Sundquist ultimately refuses to seriously engage the critical scholarship which he references, from the work on Jewish whiteness of his UCLA colleague Karen Brodkin, to Manning Marable's careful scholarship on African-American political movements, to the new Israeli historians, and to Edward Said and Rashid Khalidi.  	All this is done in the framework of a purportedly unbiased treatment of Black-Jewish relations.  But two examples will be quoted of Sundquist's peculiarly jaundiced notion of "balance" in his treatment of black-Jewish and Israeli-Palestinian issues:  "(Meir) Kahane's views were all the more remarkable for being borrowed from the same black nationalism the JDL (Jewish Defense League) meant to oppose. The paperback jacket of Kahane's "Never Again!," an exposition of JDL militancy, rightly compared the book to Cleaver's "Soul on Ice" and "The Autobiography of Malcolm X." The JDL's symbol, a clenched fist issuing from a Star of David, mirrored the clenched fist of Black Power. Consciously styling themselves "Jewish Panthers," members undertook armed community patrols...Underscoring the parallel, Kahane declared that the JDL did not differ from the Panthers in wanting to instill self-assurance and pride in young people..."  In the face of Black Power's demand that Jews acquiesce to policies inimical to their own interests, and wary of their precarious position in a nation still for the most part ruled by a Protestant elite, many Jews may well have felt hemmed in by the "politics of powerlessness." "(p. 357-59)  	This passage is reflective of Sundquist's tone throughout the relevant sections of the book: blacks threaten innocent Jews, who do not partake in the racism of other whites, and just want a "color-blind" society based on merit. Some Jews understandably react negatively to black betrayal. Black Power-the basis of this betrayal-was an insidious force sui generis, and a corruption of Martin Luther King's movement which was supported by most Jews. Some Jews have of course over-reacted. But Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X are to be equated (or worse) to Meir Kahane, and Kahane was simply reacting to their provocations. These black leaders-viewed by Sundquist as stereotypes of threatening black males rather than evolving socialist revolutionary political leaders, are more deserving of harsh criticism and dismissal than someone who immigrated to Israel to lead the most vicious and openly racist aspect of the Jewish settler movement.       "Whether or not the massacre (at Deir Yassin in April, 1948, during which Zionist forces led by Menachem Begin killed 100 Palestinian villagers, including old men, women, and children) was intended-at least some dimension of it, such as killing all the men of the village apparently had been discussed-remains a vexed question. ...Whatever the explanation for the killings at Deir Yassin, there is little doubt that the Palestinian Jews, soon to be Israelis, used the threat of other Deir Yassins, coupled with less fearsome raids on individual villages, as psychological warfare. If the killings led to wild rumors about Jewish determination to exterminate Arabs, however, such rumors were made credible less because of the way Jews conceived of the war than because of the way a number of Arabs did. Ahmed Shukeiry, aide to the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, envisioned "the elimination of the Jewish state," while Abd al-Rahman Azzam Pasha, the secretary general of the Arab League, looked forward to "a war of extermination and momentous massacre" and declared that "it does not matter how many (Jews) there are. We will sweep them into the sea." Joined with other factors-the early flight of the wealthy elite, Arab calls for women and children to evacuate, and the dissolution of Palestinian military leadership-fears that Israelis were bent on waging such a war, a mirror image of the declarations of Arab leaders, were a decisive factor in the momentous outflow of Arab refugees in the months to come. Responding to concerted attacks by five Arab nations bent on destroying the Jewish state, Israel captured some 30 percent more territory than it had been granted by the United Nations. With the exodus of the Arabs, a Jewish majority was created. So too, the "Palestinian problem," the approximately 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in Palestine, most expecting to return after Arab nations had driven out the Jews ... " (p. 374-375)  	This virtually propagandistic obfuscation is typical of Sundquist's treatment of Israel and Palestine throughout his historical account, from 1948 to 1967 to 1973, with Israel's survival always assumed to be at stake from hateful Arab nations. The most significant and brutal Jewish massacre of Arabs is buried in a sea of equivocation (including a veiled reference to the myth of "Arab broadcasts") in a selective and distorted historical context-without regard, for example, to what is now known about Zionist plans for transfer (carried out before and after Deir Yassin), collusion between Zionist leaders and the leader of Trans-Jordan (Emir Abdullah) to prevent the formation of a Palestinian state, or the tepidness of Arab intervention, arguably not a serious threat to the nascent but already well-armed Jewish state. Again, in spite of the Sundquist's references to new Israeli historians like Avi Shlaim and to Rashid Khalidi, he seems unwilling to seriously address the implications of what is now conventional scholarly wisdom, which well explains the ongoing destruction of Palestinian national aspirations.       In his narrative context, both American and Israeli Jews-including the worst sorts of neoconservatives and Likudniks (although not always clearly distinguishable from liberals and Laborites)-maintain an essential innocence and humanity; black Americans and Palestinians, on the other hand, are seen as easily manipulated by the demagogic appeals of their leaders, who ultimately undermine whatever legitimate aspirations their followers might have, which can best be served (according to Sundquist) by traditional liberal activism (as defined by Jews). In tracing what he sees as the naïve and unwarranted affinity of black nationalists for the Palestinian cause, Sundquist casts aspersions on third world liberation movements as antithetical to the centrist, domestic liberalism with which he, and in his view most Jews, rightly identify. African-Americans, according to Sundquist, have been betrayed by their leaders, whose criticism of Jews is self-serving and impractical at best, and anti-Semitic and violent at worst. Ultimately, Sundquist collapses James Baldwin, Malcolm X, and Stokely Carmichael onto Louis Farrakhan, Leonard Jeffries, and Tony Martin.       At bottom, Strangers in the Land fails as a work of political criticism not only due to a careless rendering of reality in the Middle East, but due to an unwillingness to entertain the notion of a peculiarly Jewish intellectual and ideological contribution to white racism and the maintenance of white privilege in this country, including the projection of racist attitudes onto the Israel-Palestine conflict, and onto western relations with the Arab and Muslim worlds. While the notion of Jewish racism is absent from this book (as if the experience of discrimination and the Holocaust makes such a thing unthinkable and impossible), an indigenous anti-Semitism is assumed to be long-standing, central, and substantial in African-American culture. Sundquist has thus written a book that accepts the basic assumptions of neoconservative ideology, with all of the racist baggage that that implies at home and abroad. In these narrative confines, there is no objective place to stand from which to understand the peculiarly Jewish-American contribution to this ideology, and to propose a new interpretation of Black-Jewish relations based at least partly on Jewish self-criticism, including criticism of what has turned out to be a morally and politically disastrous Jewish state.  
 I agree with the above review; minimal information, absolutely horrible photos and rather crummy quality paper makes this book not worth buying.  Meadmore selected many chairs that are discussed much more completely in other similar books.  He missed a few key chairs of note; Saarinen's Grasshopper chair and Aalto's Armchair 400 (Zebra or tank) chair.  If you want a good welll rounded selection of Modern Chairs, I'd suggest the 1000 Chairs book instead 
 I have been a design student for about two years and I purchased this book soley through word of mouth.  I approached this book as if I was a beginner, knowing that the book was intended for such readers.  However, as I read through the pages and completed most of the exercises, I realized that if I had been a true novice, that this book would have been extremely difficult to understand and very frustrating.  In sections such as dividing a square, the author unclearly explains how to find the center of a square by drawing its diagonals, but fails to explain how to find the midpoints of the sides, and instead, assumes that you already know how to do so.  The exercises are the worst part of this book.  Like a beginner, I performed each exercise according to the author's instructions.  However, I always ended up with distorted images.  An example is when the author asks you to duplicate a cube in each direction.  Unless you are a machine, your cube will not be perfect and your duplicated cubes would only come out distorted.  But that is why a cube is already provided for you in the book for you to work on.  However, it seems that even professionals are imperfect, for when you duplicate the cube which is provided in the book, you still end up with distorted cubes.  As a beginner I would have been extremely frustrated.  I even asked one of my instructors to see if she could perform the exercise and she ended up with distorted  cubes as well.  Not only were the exercises frustratingly difficult, but the book's soft covers did not make it a suitable workbook.  Most of the time you're asked to work from off the sketces in the book, but the pages are constantly bending as you're sketching in it, and the illustrator's sketches are not very accurate in terms of perspective and scale.  I gave this book 2 stars because it does indeed mention good points when it comes to design, such as visual thinking, perspective, the "box method", and lettering.  But those points are not thoroughly explained enough and the exercises are terribly presented especially for a novice designer 
 There are several discrepancies in this book, starting with the title.  The top job is an air traffic controller, making approx. $120K a year.  Here's the problem:  To become an air traffic controller, a person must enroll in an FAA-approved education program and pass a pre-employment test that measures his or her ability to learn the controller's duties. Exceptions are air traffic controllers with prior experience and military veterans. The pre-employment test is currently offered only to students in the FAA Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative Program or the Minneapolis Community & Technical College, Air Traffic Control Training Program. The test is administered by computer and takes about 8 hours to complete. To take the test, an applicant must apply under an open advertisement for air traffic control positions and be chosen to take the examination. When there are many more applicants than available positions, applicants are selected to take the test through random selection. In addition to the pre-employment test, applicants must have 3 years of full-time work experience, have completed a full 4 years of college, or a combination of both. In combining education and experience, 1 year of undergraduate study--30 semester or 45 quarter hours--is equivalent to 9 months of work experience. Certain kinds of aviation experience also may be substituted for these requirements. That to me says I need a degree!  Several other jobs listed in the book are also "mis-informing".  
 These shoes are hideous! Who would wear them? They are so uncomfortable. They always give me blisters! I hate these shoes. Do not buy them unless you like getting blisters 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 John Hagee pockets around 1 million dollars a year. I wonder how much he sends to Darfur to help the women being raped instead of sending it to Isreal to try and help his theory of (whoever is in with Isreal, is in with God)  If you could do one thing better than GOD, would you still believe?...............  I would like you to imagine for a moment, a mother's love. I think we can all agree, the bond between a mother and child is one of the strongest bonds known to mankind, in any time or culture. Now imagine you are the mother of two children. One boy and one girl, their ages are unimportant.  Got the image in your head? Great, now imagine one child is always a troublemaker, quite a little heathen if you will. The child never listens to anything you say, gets in trouble at school, and even sometimes says they hate you. Child number two, is a perfect little angel, always does what they are told, hugs you and kisses you often and whispers their love for you every night before they fall asleep.   Of course you may discipline the naughty child, but do you still have unconditional love for both children mommies and daddies of the world?   Of course you say?   Well let's see..........  Late one summer night you decide to go to the corner store to buy some milk after the children have fallen asleep, upon returning only ten minutes later you are horrified to see that your house is engulfed in flames. Knowing both children are inside, and could be burning alive at this very moment, you know you need to make a quick judgement. Which child will you save??????  What ??    Both you say?   Why would you save both children?????  What?? Because you love both of them??? Why?  One child is a complete terror, and doesn't even love you!!! Why would you do such a thing???  The Christian God wouldn't!!  What you say??? God has unconditional love, even more than a mere human mother?  Really????  Well, let's take a look at the GOD of love for just a moment...  God has many children in this world yet he punishes those who do not love or "believe" in him, with fire for ALL ETERNITY does that sound like unconditional love to you???  If I, as a mere human mother, can love my children with the unconditional love that GOD cannot, does he truly love and forgive better than us "silly" humans that he supposedly created?   Or are we all just ignorant children, hoping that our "father's" approval (with strict unrealistic conditions), equals love?  You decide... Can you do something better than God?  What you say, if he didn't love us he wouldn't have sent Jesus to "save" us and forgive our sins? We'll believing in Jesus is still a condition isn't it? Something to think about.  Ps.    The sins of god include: murder (of the whole world except the ark), impregnating a virgin, rewarding lot after he tried to give away his virgin daughters to the town, acceptance of polygamous marriages in the old testament, etc. etc. etc. If a human were on trial for the same things we would put them away forever. Yet we excuse God by saying he knows what's best for us and he can do whatever he wants because he is GOD. Our American laws are based on the ten commandments yet we follow the laws of GOD who cannot keep his own commandments. If God was truly a perfect being he would have known in his "all time seeing vision" that we would mess up, and he wouldn't have tested eve with the apple. If God never made mistakes why did he wipe out the entire planet with a flood after the first batch of people did work out? If God didn't make mistakes why bother with the ten commandments if he knew nobody could follow them and he would have to send Jesus to get crucified on a cross to make up for it? I thought God knew everything. Frankly I've seen better administrative work during the Clinton administration, and that's saying something.  When will the (educated) wealthy countries learn to spread hope through actual tangible help to third world nations instead of "helping" them with false promises of heaven while we steal their oil, diamonds, and hope?  We have battered those weaker than us with our "religion" for far too long Somebody stop the planet, this "saved" Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist turned Evangelical Atheist wants to get off.

 Dear Sean,  Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.  All my best,  Bill  PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced 
 Mr. Chandra's creation, from the title onwards, is a ruefully falsified description of the city of Bombay, one of the most banal and dirtiest cities in Asia, as is well known.  The author's words and ideas apply to any reasonably peaceful, affluent Latin or South American city, which can given scale and space to the fanciful stories contained in this collection.  Bombay has no such capacity;  it only breaks down people into miniatures of themselves, to the level of the grim and the persistent human defecation abound in public places.  Frankly, very few Indian people would bestow Bombay its own book.  They know how dehumanizing the city has become, and perhaps always was.  It is perhaps the most emblematic Asiatic city.  Read Mr. Chandra's book, but know that it contains no truth 
 This is the guy who brought us the fawning page-turner, Team Bush.  No research in here, no grounding in reality, mostly recycling of past work.  He's written this book, what?, ten or twelve times over the past two decades.  Enough already.  
 I read this book and find it poorly written.  The Author has no real story line, he keeps going off in different directions and never keeping to the story at hand.  He puts too much junk into it.  First rule of any writing - keep it simple and straight to the one and leave the fluff out 
 I found these essays disappointing as one quite familiar with the strength and breath of Dobyns work.  I felt the questions he asks are too easy, too obvious for such a formidable thinker, I found this quite surprising, and  so though I enjoyed the essays, I didn't really learn anything new 
 There is no curse to the Kennedy family.  It is just pure and simple the whole Kennedy clan is evil and they have been evil for the last 150 years.    What i can't understand is why do people like JFK?  He is actually the worse one of all of 'em.  The down fall of america all started with him.  By down fall i mean the morals of the american people started to drop when JFK was president and americans for some reason love him.  I guess it's like making a pack with Satan.  I don't feel sorry for any of them, especially Ted who is just a useless drunk 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 I too had to purchase this book for a class. It did not help. There is too much information compacted into one paragraph. Then it is very reduntant. Each chapter seems to be repeating itself even though it is suppose to be on another subject of philosophy. I would not suggest this book to anyone. It was a good thing I had prior knowledge of philosophy so I could pass my class. If you know nothing of philosophy, this book will only confuse you more 
 As a textbook for teaching the fundamentals of nuclear engineering, the Lamarsh-Baratta text is horrible.  It is riven with errors in the text and examples (and we are using the 3rd edition), the questions are infuriatingly vague at times and in general it does a poor job of explaining an admittedly difficult subject.  Regarding the large numbers of typos, I and my classmates had to search the web for an errata sheet and even then we continue to find errors such as formulae written incorrectly and wrong values for constants.  As for being vague, this text makes you assume many things.  A favorite example is a problem early in the text where we not only have to assume neutron energies, we also had to assume fuel type.  Then we have to assume energy released per fission and somehow come up with an answer we can be confident in.  Ridiculous.  The examples are hit and miss - occasionally they are helpful, an omission I am sure that will be corrected in the 4th edition.  We find ourselves relying on outside texts and materials much of the time to supplement this poorly written textbook.  EDIT ADDED TWO YEARS LATER - Now with perspective from the job world...  After graduating and entering the work force, I mostly stand by the above.  I will admit that I do have my copy still with me.  It does provide the occasional useful overview of a wide breadth of topics.  I must once again point out the many errata.  I still regard it as inexcusable even though I know mistakes do happen - but this is the 3rd edition.    Another thing that would be enormously useful would be if the next edition included units.  When teaching this subject, watching how units cancel out or are used can be very, very helpful to undergrad students.  Many students will be forced to use this.  I would suggest keeping it on your bookshelf, but if you are supposed to use this in your class, I strongly recommend Nuclear Reactor Engineering by Glasstone and Sesonske as a supplement.  The third edition of the Glasstone book can still be found for a reasonable price if you can't afford the most recent edition 
 This is a filmography, not a biography. This book focuses almost entirely on Kurosawa's and Mifune's films, giving almost no insight into what their lives were like, or what they were like as people. The first half of this 800-page book is an interminable series of synopses of their early works -- films of significance today only as harbingers of much greater things to come. (Particularly annoying is the author's endless quoting of contemporary reviews from "Variety.") The second half still focuses primarily on the films and the minutiae of their production, but provides some substance about K&M's personal lives. However, it is not nearly enough to get a clear picture of Mifune and Kurosawa as real-life people. We, the readers, always feel like fans still observing the two legends from a distance, learning almost nothing of their personal lives. For instance, barely half a page is spent on Mifune's wedding, and essentially nothing is written about his wife, Sachiko.  In addition, although this is a dual biography-the justification being that Mifune and Kurosawa did their best work together-Mr. Galbraith fails to convey what kind of relationship, whether personal or professional, the two had. Rather, the book's focus alternates from one to the other between chapters. A glaring omission in this regard is a failure to examine their famous falling out. The overly cautious author only hints that it was due to Mifune's reluctance to be tied down by the perfectionist director's lengthy shoots ("Red Beard," their last film together, took 2 years to film), that Mifune, once he gained fame, preferred quick, easy-money projects to support his luxurious lifestyle. However, almost no anecdotes are given to illustrate this or any other aspect of their relationship.    In summary, the definitive English-language biographies of Mifune and Kurosawa have yet to be written 
 I saw him live in 1987 when he was hot and hoped this would be a great reminder of his hilarious sense of humor and delivery but it was far too short (only 45 minutes) and only had a couple of good routines.  My hopes were higher than what this delivered!  The bonus material was taken from Vegas when he was near the end and it really was not very funny.  I would recommend looking at another DVD of his rather than purhcase this one 
 DEVOID OF INSIGHT OR ORIGINAL THOUGHT HILTZIG CONTINES TO TAKE CREDIT FOR OTHER PEOPLES RESEARCH AND THEN STATES IN A MOST BORING NANNER 
 I'm disappointed to see some reviewers of this book state that it's origins are in the "real-life" disappearance of American Tourists in Burma.  I too, believed the "author's note" and believed her back story.  Of course, as you get into the book you realize that there is far too much information available to Tan for this to be a true story (yes, even if based on the telepathic communications of the deceased narrator!).  I decided to search the internet for the story of these tourists. Instead I found an interview (NPR) with Tan in which she states she is surprised that people didn't realize that even the author's note is fiction.  What????  She goes on to state that she only wanted to allow the reader to suspend disbelief.  Isn't that understood when we pick up a book in the fiction category?  Does she need to add this to 'help' us?  It only serves to insult the reader or make them feel tricked into believing her.  When I went to my book club and shared the information with others the overwhelming response was anger.  Unfortunately, this was my first book by Tan and will be my last.  
 The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night 
 I have enjoyed this authors other books, but this one is repetative and the authors evaluation of the children she writes about is less than professional.  I would not recomend this book to parents with young children with behavior problems.  There are reasons other than the ones given for childhood problems.  It is not fair to restrict ones views with the opinions in the boo 
  I purchased this book without reading the reviews and I regret that now! The book essentially tells the story of two interfaith families, and how they coped with the spiritual education of their children. One family opted to raise their children as Jews, the second choose to raise the children as both ,   which led to little or no religious based education. This was quite disheartening for me, as our plan is to both baptize our children, and have a traditional bris or naming ceremony. I wanted to learn how to teach my kids about God, Jesus, and the bible staying as true as possible to both Catholicism and Judaism . Understanding this is going to be quite a challenge I was putting a lot of hope into this volume. Unfortunately, this book offered no practical solutions, except to favor raising your kids as Jews. At no point did this text offer any solution on what to do if both parents are very strong in their faith and want to pass that on. I am disappointed that a book that asks a simple question never really answers it. At one point in   the book, the daughter of the 'both' family indicates she is sorry she isn't anything. She 'resents she was raised without a real religion'.   That is so sad, and this book never explains what to do to prevent the result.  Try a different source. This one will only frustrate you.

 Gish recently retired, so let's take one last look at one of his most popular books, Evolution? The Fossils Say No! (ETFSN).    Throughout his creationist career, Gish was a prime example of the "lying for Jesus" strategy.   ETFSN contains many examples of Gish's legendary dishonesty.    Let's start with Gish's ancient quotes and references.  ETFSN, copyright 1995, has over 75 citations and/or quotations from 1970 or earlier!  That's pathetic.    It also calls a 31-year old study on radiometric dating "recent."  That's blatantly dishonest.    In debates in the '70s and `80s, Gish claimed that the geologic column is based on the assumption of evolution, but in 1982 Chris McGowan challenged him with a geology book written before Darwin had even been born, showing essentially the same geologic column used today.  Faced with this evidence, Gish admitted his error and withdrew the argument.  So, that seems reasonable.  Gish made an innocent mistake, admitted the error, and withdrew the argument.  End of story, right?  Not quite.  Despite having admitted that the argument was wrong, Gish continued using it in subsequent debates and included it again in ETFSN!  That's contemptible.  Gish also makes numerous mistakes.  For example, he insists that "fully functional" anatomical features, like feathers and wings, can't evolve step by step, and in fact would be completely useless in less than "fully functional" form.  But recent fossil discoveries show ancient dinosaurs with very primitive feathers, little more than fuzzy hairs.  Later there are dinosaurs with fluffy, not aerodynamic, feathers.  Only much later do we finally find fully aerodynamic feathers on reptilian-looking birds.  So fossils actually say YES to evolution!    Wings can exist in less than "fully functional" form, too.  Richard Dawkins points out that some frogs use webbed feet for gliding, tree-snakes with flattened bodies can maneuver through the air, and some squirrels have flaps along their bodies for gliding.  Not only are animals with half a wing common in nature, so are animals with a third of a wing, a fourth of a wing, or even less!    But even more critical than his many mistakes, Gish simply can't be trusted to tell the truth.  Richard Trott reports a whole series of falsehoods by Gish during a 1994 talk at Rutgers.  For example, Gish stated that there are no fossil precursors to the dinosaur Triceratops.  In reality there are well known precursors, Monoclonius and Protoceratops, which appear in proper sequence in the fossil record and show the expected change in body size, number of horns, etc.  Gish also indicated that all three ceratopsians were contemporaneous.  In reality, Protoceratops came first, followed by Monoclonius, followed by Triceratops.  Trott's article exposing Gish's falsehoods prompted a reply from Gish which contained still more dishonest statements!    Joyce Arthur reports another series of Gish falsehoods.  In the 1979 version of ETFSN, Gish claimed that Dubois concealed his discovery of Wadjak Man for about 30 years.  But in 1982 C. Loring Brace told Gish in a debate that Dubois had actually published, not one, but two reports about Wadjak Man shortly after its discovery.  Nevertheless, Gish repeated the same falsehood in Evolution: The Challenge of the Fossil Record (1985) and again in a 1992 debate with Karl Fezer.  Fezer even provided Gish with the references for Dubois's publications on Wadjak Man, but Gish repeated the same falsehood yet again in ETFSN.   Arthur pointed out Gish's falsehood again in 1996, but Gish repeated it yet again in a 1997 debate.  Such blatant, repetitive dishonesty is simply contemptible.    In a 1983 PBS broadcast, Gish dismissed the significance of the similarity of chimp and human proteins, claiming that some bullfrog proteins were more similar to human proteins than chimp proteins were.  Asked to identify the specific proteins, Gish promised to do so, claiming that he had them in his records, but he never produced them, including in ETFSN.  In fact, there were no such proteins.  Gish simply made them up.    Gish has such a poor reputation, that even other creationists frequently just ignore him.  For example, in 1985 Gish classified Java Man, Peking Man, and ER 1470 as clearly ape; but in 1992 Lubenow classified all three as clearly human!    Gish recently retired from the ICR, which worked hand in hand with Gish in spreading falsehoods.  The ICR promotes and sells Gish's trashy books, including his comic book "Have You Been Brainwashed?"   The ICR continued selling the original version for at least nine more years after Gish himself admitted that it contained numerous errors.  The ICR is still selling a revised, 1994 version, but even the revised version still contains some of the same errors as the original!  So who is brainwashing whom???  These examples (and many others) show how dishonest Gish is and help explain why creationists publish their ideas in oral debates and lectures, or in popular books like ETFSN, not in professional science journals.  In debates, if Gish is caught in a falsehood in front of one audience, that doesn't prevent him from repeating the same falsehood in front of other audiences.  And in books like ETFSN, Gish knows he can get away with lying, because most creationists aren't likely to check his statements.  Such blatant dishonesty can't survive the peer-review process of professional science journals, however, which is why creationists like Gish never publish their creationist trash there.   
 Based on the book's description as "...a complex and compelling tale of political upheaval, espionage, sexual passion, and all the suffering wrought by war, poverty, oppression, and exile... told brilliantly with empathy and panache.", you might think  this would be a fascinating read.  But this book wasn't quite the read I thought it would be.  Berberova really needed a strong editor to help her tighten her writing.  There were too many people mentioned and the story tended to take so many tangents into other people's lives, making it difficult to get a strong sense of who Moura was.    But you can get a sense of who Moura wasn't.  She wasn't a great mom (but to her defense, that was probably the case of a lot of women in her situation), wasn't a great friend, and not too devoted to anyone except herself.    The repeated name dropping made the book frustrating as well.  Whether they were in her life for a week or a decade, it seems that Berberova mentions everyone Moura ever met.  The index in the back of the book was necessary just to help distinguish the characters as there is little way to keep them all straight.  
 "Footsteps" is not the first novel you want to read by PA Toer.  It should be the third.  PAT is a great writer, no doubt; it's a shame he was never awarded the Nobel Prize that he deserved.  As for "F", it does not have the edge that the first two novels in his famed Buru Quartet - "This Earth of Mankind" and "Child of all Nations" - have.  It's not a stretch to say that reading "F" is like watching the third Godfather movie:  it just doesn't have it; but you watch anyway.  And so I read it.  It reads more like a slow-paced political history of Indonesia, and the best parts are when characters from "TEOM" and "COAN" make an appearance.  I will definitely read the fourth book in the series.  PAT is writer that you can't help but admire, but "F" just didn't resonate the way his other novels did (for me) 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I found this book to be less than helpful.  Yes, it does talk some about different literary-related fields, and I stress some, but the book lacks serious discussion of those careers.  Plus, it gives limited resources for finding out more information....no websites and no mention of other literary career-related books.  It only lists a few professional associations for each career.  Also, there were no surprises as to which careers were selected, such as...becoming a librarian.  If you just want a taste of what literary careers are out there, this book is worth a skim at your local bookstore, but if you really want to find out about these careers, follow up with books specifically geared toward a particular career 
 The first Jonathan Kellerman book I've read... And my last.  Too slow.  I'm a big fan of the murder/mystery genre but this one is a big flop 
 While the author certainly has insights and interesting things to say about the city of Mumbai, his style of writing is nothing short of painful.  Sentences are carelessly constructed.  Topics bounce from one topic to another on every page, sometimes within paragraphs.  Many sentences don't make any sense at all and words are often used incorrectly.    I read this for my book group and found it to be a real struggle.  I found myself irritated with the author from the outset and a bit astonished that this book, that has been promoted so aggressively, did not undergo a much needed edit before going to press.    The author strikes me as young, over-eager, and in great need of settling down and focusing 
 This book doesn't make any sense. It is so, so, so b-o-r-i-n-g. The book is not well written, and the sentences are way too short. I woudn't recommand this book to anyone 
 I have read over 40 books about World War I, and this is the worst book I've ever read on the subject.  The book is boring, disorganized, and relentlessly pursues it pacifist agenda.  The book is repititous ad nauseaum.  In the author's attempt to convince his readers that the ordinary soldiers didn't want to fight, he presents a huge number of barely discernible short stories and excerpts throughout the book.  The text is erratic and disorganized.  This unconvincing book seems not like the work of a published author, but the work of a human psychology student's term paper.  Much of the book simply consists of word-for-word extracts from other published media.  Ignore the positive reviews on the back cover - it's clear these reviewers didn't read more than the first few pages.  This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on!  
 I bought this item to use in lieu of my steam iron when my carpal tunnel flares up. I haven't tried using it on a wrinkled garment--only to touch up after ironing. My complaint is that the water reservoir cannot be fully emptied after use so water stays in it. Two small screws inside the reservoir are rusting after one use. I used it about 2 weeks ago and it still has water in it. I called Conair customer service and they told me you have to use all the water by steaming it out. There is a small plastic cap device and that's the only means of putting water in or taking it out. It's the same type of cap used on pool flotation devices. I'm returning this because of the water reservoir problem. It needs to be redesigned. If it were actually good for removing wrinkles, I would be afraid the rust from the screws would ruin my clothes 
 Ok so, so i ordered this thing on the 10th and it just arived today (19th) nine days later, of course the last day of there so called "Delivery Estimate" .

 there was nothing, either aesthetically or eroticaly, to justfy the sale of this book 
 I've been a great fan of Nanci Griffith, but this is not her best effort.  The songs are dull, don't stand out and all sound pretty much like studio work.  She can do so much better.  I wonder if the other good reviews where just loyaty to Nanci Griffith.  Besides inartistic song writing, what happened to her voice.  It went from a unique sound to mediocre run of the mill.  There is nothing to remember about this CD - she must have just been meeting contract obligations 
 I thought I was buying a book that would give me insight into my cat's world. What I got was a joke book and the punchline is always "Your cats just not that into you." Ok, I get it. I guess I'll take the author's advice and take her to the spa, and drop this book off in a donation bin along the way 
 It's very good book in Probability and Statistics, a must-have for any researcher.  Book's Condition is bad. There're 2 pages severely scratched 
 My mom is an avid wheel of fortune fan, and for x-mas i thought i'd buy this for her since it reminded me of a wheel of fortune game we use to have. Man do i regret it. She NEVER plays it anymore. The puzzles are limited and will start to repeat within a few weeks. The keys on the keypad are hard to push in, and if you don't push it in right soon enough you lose your turn and the general game-play is blah. Really, if you bought this for someone, it's the kind of present that they'd be happy with for all of a few hours. Then they'd let it collect dust. Like my mum is = 
 Listen.. if you have NEVER had a high school science class and need refresher CHAPTERS about how photosynthesis works, if you have a 30 second memory and can forget that you read two sentences in two consecutive paragraphs which were identical, if you have no idea about what's going on in the world and you are making an honest attempt to understand.. this is the book for you.  If you passed basic biology in high school, try a big boy book, like Guns, Germs and Steal.    I am glad people are trying though 
 While certainly a better presentation than the Rod Stewarts and Michael Boltons of the world and their flaccid stabs at music way different from a rocker's sensibilities, Buble is a standards singer for those who think Kenny G is a jazz musician and John Tesh is a pianist.  There's nothing 'wrong' with listening to him...there are just so many better alternatives.   It's the songs that are great, folks, not the singer. Seek out the people who recorded these songs in the first place, when they had REAL musicians and the best arrangers in the world working with them (a nod to Johnny Mercer, who provided some of Buble's arrangements.)  Want to know the keywords? Sinatra. Darin. Billy May. Nelson Riddle. Peggy Lee. Mel Torme. Tony Bennett. Keely Smith. Johnny Hartman. Anita O'Day. Diane Krall. Gordon Jenkins. Johnny Mercer. Cole Porter. Count Basie.   There are plenty more, but you can find them for yourself.  If you think Buble is Da Man, wait till you try Frank or Bobby Darin. You'll never look back 
 Not a bad book. It had some interesting pointers...BUT...as the title suggests... A LOT OF FLUFF!!!  It's not bad for the price (I URGE you to get a cheap USED copy)... but the same author has a MUCH stronger book called "Networking Smart". Very Good!  I gave this one star for the content... what was there, anyway 
 i hate this phone.  i moved to miami and cannot get reception anywhere. it  cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk.  i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment, so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates.  but here's the thing:  other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem!  they actually get a couple bars of reception, whereas i always have one or none at all.  i returned the phone and all they could do was give me another just like it... with all the same problems.  i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month.  i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price.  on top of that, people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous.  unless you never talk on it, the battery wears out in a hurry.  and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking.  i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident.  i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils.. chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one, or wasting money on a land line.  whatever you do, don't get suckered in by it's cute pink color, because underneath it's pretty exterior it's junk 
 Anita Shapira's New Republic essay, "The Past is Not a Foreign Country," (online) decimates this book. Adding to Efraim Karsh's 1996 study (Fabricating Israeli History), she reminds readers that Morris failed to reply. He ignored 50 Karsh references to his own work, Avi Shlaim, primary sources and major historical and journalistic studies.   In this work, Morris ironically refers to many of Karsh's sources, but nevertheless arrives at incorrect conclusions. The book is thus a politically charged revision of the Israeli-Arab conflict covering the pre-1948 through the history of Arab wars on Israel. The book shows culprits and casualties, and blames Arab regimes for violent incursions into Israel in the 1950s, for the secret war between Israel and terrorist groups, for Naser's threat to Israel before the Sinai and Six-Day wars, and for many Arab calls for Israel's destruction. Morris even notes that Israel's West Bank and Gaza rule "was never as restrictive or repressive as the Palestinians made out."   One big problem is Morris' large reliance on Israeli and secondary sources. He consults only a few primary Arab documents (and those, only in English translation), thus all but ignoring available Arab memoirs and state files. Oddly, Morris exploits every Israeli contingency plan and idea as conclusive evidence of Zionist expansionism, but ignores Arab plans for a "Greater Syria" as well as King Hussein's designs.   Another is Morris' exclusion of regional effects of the cold war, and Soviet arms that poured into Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and other Arab states, worsening Arab-Israeli relations from the 1950s on. In short, Morris ignores the fact that the opportunity for Arab-Israeli peace opened up only following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which left Arab hard-liners without support for their traditional rejections.   Worse, Morris misconstrues the notorious topic of " transfer," a term commonly used between the two world wars to describe population exchanges like that between Turkey and Greece in the 1920s. In his first work on that topic, Morris rightly concluded that the "Palestinian refugee problem was born of war, not by design, Jewish or Arab," but was (rather) a by-product of both people's fears and the protracted, bitter fighting of the first Arab-Israeli war. But that conclusion provoked attacks from Arab historians and Israeli revisionists.   Whatever the reason, Morris in this book reverses his earlier conclusion, standing history on its head. He makes effect into cause, and falsely translates the results of war into a paradigm for Arab-Jewish relations. He writes, "fear of territorial displacement and dispossession was to be the chief motor of Arab antagonism to Zionism down to 1948 (and indeed after 1967 as well)."   This reading libels Zionism and its foundations.   Actually, the Peel Commission first proposed, in 1937, to transfer the Arab minority from territory designated for the tiny Jewish state as part of a planned partition of western Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. Morris presumes that Zionist leaders "played a role in persuading the Peel Commission to adopt the transfer solution." But he provides zero proof.   In fact, Ben-Gurion welcomed the British idea only to persuade Zionists to accept a tiny Jewish state (and the proposed partition)--but also warned of its inherent dangers. Furthermore, Zionist leaders believed that a Jewish majority would come from massive immigration, and that Western Palestine could accommodate millions of Jews and Arabs. History proved them right on that score, although the peace they expected remains ever-elusive.  The Arabs initiated war in 1948 in preference to accepting a Jewish state--and thought they could win. And everywhere they prevailed, Arabs expelled every last Jew. Benny Morris should get real.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 C. Loring Braces's review above is a rehash of his review in the newsletter of the National Center for Science Education.  It is a remarkably uncritical review.  Dr. Brace stresses Dr. Graves role as a scientist.  But he is also a professor of African-American Studies.  Although the book shows impressive scholarship, it seems more of a political tract than a scientific one.  To suggest that race is merely a "construct" is facile and wrong.  This is a political line of the left that does not gain credibility merely by repitition.  It is also a line imbued by disingenuousness.  To paraphrase:  race is a mere construct invented by the white race to justify the racism that is a characteristic of the white race.  Dr. Graves is to be commended for his openess about his hatred of Sir Frances Galton, but that does not make it palatable.  To blame Galton for Hitler's use of the word "eugenics" implies that Hitler's motivation was what he claimed and that he was not opportunistically stealing a term from science.  Why do people give Hitler so much credit intellectually?  Why can't they recongize that his motives were baser than he claimed?  The connection of Galton with Hitler's later use of the term "eugenics" has always been nothing but a cheap shot 
 I agree with other reviewers that said the book is not very helpful if you are writing a PCI device driver.  It's full of register definitions and timing diagrams but I never got a feel for how to put it all together.  This book may be useful for hardware designers but it is largely worthless for software engineers.  If you're writing a driver and you want more info, don't waste your money here 
 I feel that this was below par performance for both Winona Ryder and Dennis Quaid. It just didn't gel too much as I felt as though there was too much embelishing on certain points of the movie to where the second half of the movie seemed to rush through too fast, and with too many photographs. The Jerry Lee Lewis story is a interesting one indeed since I found out he is related to Jimmy Swaggart. I often wondered how Jerry Lee reacted when Jimmy fell in 1988? I often look around at bumper stickers at cars that say If God Doesn't Exist Then Act As Though He Doesn't, and I often wonder for those who feel Christians are judgemental if a Christian falls down what is thier reaction. I admit when both Bakker and Swaggart fell I was harsh with them, and I guess I felt it was my right because it gave me creedence to the way I lived my lifestyle. Do all others feel the same way? I felt that there was also too much explaining of the inspiration of doing the song "Whole Lot Of Shakin Goin On". That is my favorite Lewis song, and then they take it to a honky tonk in Tennessee, and the women were drunk, and these were the more mature looking women, and that was a turn off for me as I just can't handle drunk people. I just found alot of things that just didn't gel with this, and June 12th, 1994 was the last time I watched this movie, and I never will again so help me God. 
 Look, I'm generally not too keen on writing up internet reviews on big ol' sellin' sites like this one. BUT, listen, all of you:  Don't get this book.  It was, in a word, GOD AWFUL. Wait, that was two.   50% of it are useless lectures of non-existent subjects and pecuilar scenarios given that all of it is predictions of what happens 60 years in the future -- which you're living right now. Some ideas are a little interesting, but fall flat because of poor dialogue and needless exaggerations.   25% of the book is a love story. Well, it tries to be, until it just goes zany at the end, with one of the most screwed up twists at the end.  And, the other 25%? Just other stuff saying how this is Heinlein's long lost first novel and how you should value this.  Haha. No.  Really, if you've never read Heinlein, DON'T START HERE. Only read this if it's free, you have a huge craze with Heinlein, you've LOVED every one of his books, AND you don't mind being given lectures much more boring, garaunteed, than your 12th grade Calculus teacher.  It's evil, and it should die. Or, it should have never been published. Something like that.  Ugh 
 I gave it one star, because there's only one star on the CD I care to hear, and that's Ms. Jane. Hey Jane baby! Make a CD, I'll buy it! ; 
 I paid what I would call a fairly high price for a blanket I could have gotten from a Discount club for half the price.  The photo is very misleading in that only the top and bottom edges are hemmed, the left/right sides are simply cut.  I expect this to disolve within 4 washes.  Will not buy from this manufacturer again 
 Although I am a huge fan of Jo Beverly, this was a disappointment. It is very hard to identify Damaris' finer qualities and start to care about her, so one wonders why Fitz would care. Also, although certainly anyone who reads romance novels cannot be a prude, it does seem a little strange--dare I say forward?--the way Damaris throws herself at Fitz and starts kissing him hotly every time they are alone. Ashart and Genova also seem to take over the book quite a bit. And yet one more quibble--Damaris' family situation turns out to be so bizarre that it just beggars belief (although the Trayce family mystery is quite fun). All in all, not one of Beverly's best 
 Long time fan, but didn't get much out of this one.  Stories were cute.  Didn't finish it, not worth more time 
 Enya has such a lovely voice. I have truly enjoyed her music, but this CD was a big disappointment. It seemed to stray from her roots. Enya's music has always taken me to my Celtic roots, but this CD was too much pop. 
 The basic concept of Lupica's latest is a strong, i.e., hazing and murder in a small town. However, Lupica's execution of the plot is fairly slow-moving and predictable, and his characters are devloped with little depth. They are one-dimensional at best, making it difficult for me to care much about what happened to them. Given the blurbs from two authors I like a lot (Harlan Coben and Robert Parker), I had high expectations for Too Far and had moved it to the top of my "to-be-read" list. As you can see, though, from my comments above, my disappoint in this book is obvious and I will not be rushing out any time soon to read another book by Lupica. Do yourself a favor and skip this book 
 Walter Scheib's adoration of the Clintons and disdain for the Bushes  is apparent throughout the book, and I find it to the Bushes' credit that he kept his position through their first term.  I would have enjoyed the book more had Scheib refrained from slipping in his snide remarks, for example: "...I wasn't alone in my sentiment...that the Texas style the Bushes brought to the White House was a step backwards.  However, I understood that Mrs. Bush was acting perfectly within her rights...".  He rarely mentions Mrs. Bush without pining for Mrs. Clinton, who never failed to do all things better.  If you think this might annoy you, then I suggest you skip this book 
 I regret buying this book. It's not a guide for young people to starting your own business unless you call part time babysitting a business or selling your goods at a flea market as having your own business. The "businesses" the author has in mind are are, for example, selling homemade goods to your friends or anyone else you can get to buy them. If you call having a lemonade stand  a business, then this book may pertain to you 
  The good thing about this movie is that it didn't last more than it did. Not that it's bad, no, it's a fine depressing movie. It may be very well acted -Duvall is great all right-, with nice songs perhaps, well directed if you like... But unless you feel identified with these characters -and I don't- there's no way you can enjoy watching this.   This is what I saw: All the characters here are self-centered individuals, conceited, self-pitying, deplorable and depressing. Duvall plays a drunk who quits drinking to start (perhaps) a new life. That he in the past was a sucessful country singer makes no difference to me, it just adds to his self-pity. I couldn't find anything positive in this story. Even the kids that show are aggravating with their persistent questions.   The picture we have here is that of a bunch of losers and dreamers. Everybody seems to blame someone else for his miseries. The children their parents, the wives their ex-husbands (& viceversa). Death, either thru war or car accidents, plays a major role too. It seems people have trouble getting over it, looking for someone to blame it on. Then the scenes in the church... I'm not sure what they are intended for. The three main characters (Duvall, Harper and the kid) go to church; him and the kid even get baptized, but they have no idea what church is all about; to them it's a social ritual (a tradition, a superstition?). This is not a movie about faith. It's about the troubles of these guys; the lady needs a man because she's young and lonely; the man needs... he needs to grow up; the kid needs a father and some homework. Nobody cares for others, only for themselves.  Honestly, the irony about this movie is that it's so realistic and its characters so phony. I understand why Duvall went immediately to make 'The Apostle', where he plays a role opposite to this one 
 I gotta give it to that little girl who plays Harriet in the movie. She did a great job. But, I found Rosie O'Donnell's performance really lacking. Which made the film a little boring to watch at times. 
 This novel reads more like an outline with big holes in both the character development and the plot.  Unlike the professional reviews, I didn't mind the excerpts that were the foundation of the historical quest - what bothered me were the characters themselves.  I found their behavior to be at times bizarre and had a hard time liking any of them.  The situations and the characters' reactions were far-fetched with no surrounding build-up of detail to back up the plot.  I give this 2 stars for originality and 0 stars for detail and character development 
 I suppose it all depends on what you expect this book to be.  I was expecting a history of chairs, with 600 pictures of the chairs.  What the book consists of is pictures of 600 mostly modern chairs, essentially all factory made, and almost all made from metal and plastic. If you're looking for pictures of chairs through time and how they developed over the centuries, look elsewhere. Extremely disappointing book 
 I put this book down probably quicker than any other book I can think of in recent memory. It's simply awful.  I can't agree with even the paltry 2 or 3 star reviews who say that the first half of the book was good, but that it misses the point (as well as basic physics, thermodynamics, economics, . . . etc.)  Even the first half of this book is awful. The first chapter was the first sign that you're in trouble. It basically just lists a bunch of "stuff" that's going on: Globalization, Protesters in the streets against it, Telecommunications, Biotech, and . . . err . . . oh yeah, let's not forget 9/11 . . . and . . . Barbara Streisand isn't as good as she used to be, blah, blah, blah. I guess this is supposed to count for serious analysis because after just listing a bunch of trends he decries how there's been no serious analysis about Globalization. (Does this guy live under a rock!?!? Maybe an ivy covered one at Wharton where he apparently teaches . . . note to self: Don't get accepted to Wharton.) The rest of the first chapter describes the oil industry in terms starker than Orwell described Big Brother. But don't despair! The Hydrogen Energy Web will save us all! It will be like what the internet was for communications but for like energy or something like that, and it will destroy the evil oil companies, and it'll make everyone rich, we'll all be able to move back to countryside (I'm serious, he's basically claiming that), it will lay golden eggs, make your first born smarter and prettier, make your hair grow back, etc. Where will get the hydrogen? Oh it comes from stars or something, it's the most abundant element in the universe! OK, who will set up this web? (I'm not kidding here, again) Well, big corporations stole the internet before VOLUNTEER GROUPS could set it up, so we'll have VOLUNTEER GROUPS create the hydrogen energy web this time around. Oh, err, big companies will still be needed to, like, make all the hardware, and all the software (he actually concedes this point in a dismissive sentence), will be needed to send people out to fix any problems, to coordinate it, to, well, actually build it, but somehow it will be made by volunteer groups anyway and big companies won't really be a part of it. Even though they will be.  But they won't. LOOK OVER THERE! A giant ball of oil company induced global warming is heading straight for us!!!   The second chapter is even better. He complains about how many classifications of oil reserves there are. With completely non-sensical names like "identified reserves", "non-identified reserves", and whatnot (boo-hoo, boo-hoo, there's just soooo many of them) he concludes that they can only have been created to confuse people so that the big oil executives and politicians can manipulate, confuse, and deceive the stupid masses into believing something or another about oil. (I was never quite certain what that was supposed to be. Oh well.) But not Mr. Rifkin! He's beaten them. He's defined "conventional oil" all himself, which excludes all oil that has been found but is currently uneconomical to extract and sell, all oil in polar regions, and all oil underneath the oceans. He does this to prove that we're running out of oil, and that the big oil companies are cooking the books. Tonight I'm going eat "conventional food" which will exclude all food in two thirds of the Kitchen, and all food in, say, the Living Room, to prove to my family that we're all going to starve to death. Don't tell me I'm wrong son! You're cooking the books!! Don't you see we're all going to DIE!    This book is not only awful, it's duplicitous. One of the few mentions of nuclear power is to say in two sentences basically: Utilities put a lot money into nuclear in the '60's and '70's. In the '80's the utilities made the consumer bear the brunt of a lot cost overruns and power plant shutdowns. The idea is to imply that nuclear power was a giant failure with a bunch of cost overruns and power plants that couldn't keep running. Both sentences might be technically true (because there's no mention of nuclear power in the second), but they're crafted to make you imply a conclusion without any specific evidence or argument.   Let's be clear: This book is a political diatribe. Big oil bad, Hydrogen good because it will do all these wonderful things. How will it do all these wonderful things? Some unconvincing arguments, red herrings, and incomplete and inconclusive examples and complete hypotheticals.   One of the biggest flaws is how it handles (or, more accurately, fails to) where hydrogen will come from, since it is not a primary energy source the way oil, coal, or nuclear is. It will take more energy to extract hydrogen from either natural gas or water than we will ever be able to get from the extracted hydrogen, thanks to the second law of thermodynamics. This is the critical question of what will replace oil, period, and only four pages are dedicated to it. The author's answer is solar. His argument for solar? Well, basically, solars's getting cheaper. That's not a complete argument! Is it FEASIBLE to power the world off solar? To power the United States off solar today would require a solar array the size of a small state! And you'd have to make another state size solar array to handle the growth in energy demand. God forbid the sun not shine one day. (Or maybe we'll have to invade the Middle East still because they have like 364 sunny days a year over there, leaving us at the mercy of the islamist anyway. Norway will probably invade Southern California too.) Solar by itself is getting cheaper, great, what about it's cost RELATIVE to other sources? There's zero discussion about using coal, or nuclear to power electrolysis of hydrogen.   This book is mostly a political posture. He puts forward a fantasy political vision, and tries to scare you into thinking it's the only thing that will save us from impending doom with some false techno-babble in lieu of any actual coherent plan or argument.   There are only two possible ways this book could help solve energy problems. One, you could burn it instead of heating oil this winter. Or two, if some magical invention could tap into all the hot air this author blows out his pipe we could use it to turn a turbine. Probably forever. I'm hoping for this latter option, but planning on the first. 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say
