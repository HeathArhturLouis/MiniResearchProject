 This was on television earlier today. It's a horribly dated film. Bad pacing, bad music, with not much of a plot. Also, I'd suggest not eating at Dante's. And please, try not to kill the messengers 
 Spare me another movie about how the big bad Catholic Church makes life dull and arduous until everybody is rescued by a sexually liberated Mary Poppins. The film's agenda is all over it and Binoche's character is just too "practically perfect in every way."  
 Very basic book that covers no new ground.  Go to your local library and find a fitness/weight lifting book.  You won't miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book.  
 The manual mainly covers the earlier years. Later models are more mentioned 
 Virtually all the ideas in this book are already practiced by most successful company's - they just describe them differently. There is nothing new. My other problem is how the author uses the book to promote a personal agenda. And talk about ego - his family, friends, and other business initiatives are promoted in the book. And most of the pictures have nothing to do with the title of the book or how it is positioned. If it's going to be an autobiography, TELL US SO. I should have known something was up when most of the reviewers were either politicians, friends or other people that have never ran successful businesses.   And speaking of business success, a share of stock in Jan 1994 (around the time Mr. Bakke became CEO) was trading at an adjusted $5 per share. Seven years later in December of 2002 (the year Mr. Bakke retired), the share price was $3.02. No thanks - I'll put my money in GE. Need I say more.   Look, I'm sure this guy is a great person and he is obviously super smart but I do not think this is a credible book. 
 I know that this review will be followed by several saying that I am stupid and am not aware of how awesome Shadows Fall is, but I still think it is worthwhile to let other people know my opinion. I was excited for this album, Shadows Fall shows so much potential at times but this release is such a disappointment. While it isn't terrible, it just is not good. It suffers the pitfall of many metal releases, all the songs follow identical formats and never keep your interest. If you don't believe me, scan through this CD and let me know if almost all (with the exception of one or two) aren't : a kind of cool guitar intro that might lead to something cool, then drums come in with the same predictable snare on every beat,and then mediocre vocals singing some of the most lackluster vocal in recent memory.  Don't buy this album looking for some sort of blistering heavy metal experience. Don't buy this album if you want something you may replay again. If you want to buy a mediocre heavy metal album then I guess you should buy this album, but I say take a stand. Don't just buy whatever Shadows Fall puts out in front of you. The War Within was a good CD. The follow up bonus track CD was just a desperate attempt to make more money with nothing new and this CD is just a group that didn't really try and put out some music.  I'm sorry to all the die hard Shadows Fall fans, and you may enjoy this album which is great for you, but I really felt like Shadows Fall underachieved and didn't really put enough into this release. I know they could have done better 
 Shame on you Disney, for trying to bleed me of my hard-eard money.  I call Shenanigan

 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 We  hastily bought this book for a friend and just as quickly returned it after taking a look at it's content. If you're still on the carnivor boat and wish to expose your child to the high dioxin and chemical load found in meat, then this book's for you. If you're a bit more informed and concerned about the contamination of meat, then look elsewhere for alternative nutrition and recipe info. As a pharmacist, let me tell you that children are exceptionally sensitive to the chemical contamination that is in U.S. produced meat. This ain't the good ol' days and meat has changed. Be very careful where your animal products come from or consider eliminating them altogether 
 McCarthy is a very talented writer (read Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses) but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing, using many archaic words. Suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot. Despite the novel's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character. Certain chapters are interesting (the workhouse chapter especially), but these passages are few and far between. Also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way. McCarthy writes about nature beautifully, but after finishing this book, one is left unfulfilled. 
 I loved the first book (and all of her other works) but this one while it held my attention also annoyed me.  Way too much time was given to the spoiled little girl and she lost me from the very beginning when it was explained that if she didn't get to watch the movie every day she screamed.  Sadly the adults were almost as spoiled as the children and it was hard to feel any kind of sympathy or empathy for the main character when she was the one who had created these brats 
 Beautiful looking but the quality is sub-par to say the least. I had bought this piece along with two bowls which had plastic lids.  This one broke after one use, the lids didn't fit my bowls.  Poor to no quality control in this product 
 You could make your own!  I bought these through a catalog for my 3 year-old last Christmas.  He pretends they are leaf-blowers.  If you find the "sweet spot", the tones are okay, but finding that spot isn't easy.  Too much money for not-enough product 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 I read a lot. A LOT. And rarely have I read a book that I really, really didn't like, but this is one of them. There is such a lack of dialogue, and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over. I swear, if I would have had to read the words "four years" one more time (referring to the main character's failed relationship) I would have hurt somebody. There was so much that could have been done with this book. But, by the time she actually gets the house, you've been bored stiff for four years and don't much care. It seems to be that it was poorly edited, and there is a lot of awkward grammar. I was really disappointed. 
 I looked around and read reviews and information on numerous down comforters, and I thought I was getting a real bargain with the Royal Velvet.  Boy, was I wrong!  I have already had to replace it and I used it less than a month.  All the down settled down the channels to the sides, so there was NONE covering the body at night.  Not good!  Do not buy this comforter, it is crap 
 This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it.  
 If I have watched a worse movie, in my rather long life, I cannot remember it.  This is not even more camelot pap, for those who worship at the alter of the kennedy clan.The thing just stinks,phew 
 As an atheist with a strong belief in ethical behavior and doing good for others, I have always had a certain ambivalence towards Mother Teresa. I was expecting Hitchens to reveal all sorts of previously unknown facts about how Mother Teresa was actually a phony, mistreating others and scamming funds for her own financial benefit. But actually the portrait that emerges is of a very sincere and dedicated woman, though politically and socially naive in her actions. In fact, almost all of Hitchens' criticisms of Mother Teresa could be equally directed towards the Vatican itself. Yes, I disagree with her staunch opposition to birth control and abortion, also, that in her zealous affirmation of Church doctrine, she is often doing more harm than good to the very people she is trying to help. But does this make her an evil menace, as Hitchens seems to suggest? No, not really, just a misguided person who is still very sincere and dedicated to helping the poor according to her own religious convictions.   I don't feel like I learned much from this book that I didn't already know. Also I was somewhat put off by Hitchens' consistently arrogrant and snide tone. He really seems to be going for the jugular against Mother Teresa. If he had more damning facts in his case against her I might be more open to his harsh commentary. Instead he is basically providing a critique that could be equally leveled against the Vatican and conservative Catholic dogma in general. To me this information was already well known and not really worthy of a personal attack against Mother Teresa herself. To someone with no knowledge of Church doctrine or its questionable political affiliations this might be an informative read. But, for me, it was a dull disappointiment 
 I have just taken a programming theory which used this book. This book has very poor descriptions and basically I had to peice things together from other students. Honestly, if you're going to buy a book for your own personal enrichment this is definetly not the way to go. No answers. Bad Descriptions. akward proofs. nuff sai 
 I thought that this movie fell short of even B horror flick standards. I did like the scenic shots of the film but the dialog and the "mutants" of this film didn't really hold my attention. The "mutants" were not even mutants at all. They looked like everyday people that you would see on the street. Well,  they didn't look disfigured is what I mean. The guy that was acting like he was part of the "Rap Culture" was the most irritating of them all. I really wanted to like this movie, but I am sorry that I didn't. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Even those B horror fans 
 We used this book for an adult Sunday School class that I taught.  I was extremely disappointed by the superficial treatment of the text.  I found myself using the Biblical text and other sources.  For the most part Dr. Swindoll's book was a distraction rather than a help.  For example, 2 Samuel 7 descibes God's covenant with David that Christ, the True King, would be David's descendant.  Swindoll uses this text as to how to react when God says no to our plans. (In this case, it is God's rejection of David as the builder the temple that Solomon eventually built)  The covenant IS the point and Dr. Swindoll completely misses it. If your looking for moralisms that you really already knew this is your book.  If you want a serious study of the life of David you would do well to look elsewhere or try something bold-- a careful reading of the Biblical text. 
 As a Christian, reading this book was so painful and made me so sick, that I couldn't finish it.  Never have I read such a twisted explanation of the Scriptures.  The author's aim is to rationalize the Bible to fit his "alternative" lifestyle, among other commandments God explicitly and clearly addresses in His Word.  The Bible is the living Word of God, the same yesterday, today, and forever.  Please pray for Peter Gomes and Harvard's Memorial Church in Cambridge, MA 
 This book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book (this has been noted by others) Anything of interest is said in the first chapter, followed by a lot of fluff - "sometimes the crowd is wise" "sometimes the crowd is not wise".  After the first chapter, I seriously couldn't read for more than 10 minutes without getting bored 
 Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title.  Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line.  It is also worth noting that at least one of the "great" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal.  Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much 
 "Nobody touches the Lonely Planet for budget travel advice," states the back cover of this book.   I just finished travelling around Southeast Asia with this as my primary guidebook. It includes the basics for getting around, eating, etc... but it really is just the basics. I have used other books from the lonely planet series in the past, and have found them good enough to continue using, at least until this volume. It has been 5 years since I was in this region last, and things have changed. Especially the guidebook, which was once a rich trove of off-the-beaten-path hints and tips. Increasingly, however, it seems that the Lonely Planet authors seem less interested in helping you find a unique experience and more interested in serving up a cookie-cutter, package tourist rehash. I have a couple grievances with this book:    -It insists on constantly pointing out little sidebars entitled "Splurge!" which indicate ways that the budget traveller can spend a great deal of money in one shot. Why this is in a travel guide called "shoestring" I couldn't tell you. Neither do the authors, but I suppose we can assume that backpackers are interested in spending $5 a night for a couple of months and then blowing $150 to stay in some posh hotel in Kuala Lumpur or racking up an additional $20 in credit card debt for an entirely forgettable dining experience in Bangkok. I just don't feel these are relevant to 99% of actual budget travellers, but they waste a lot of space that could be much better used on greater detail. But I will get to that in a minute.    -Another issue I have is the lack of actual information about actually moving from one place to the next cheaply.  Cheap local transport is available in many of the places covered in the book.  For some reason though, the book usually offers helpful advice like 'just take a cab,' or 'buses are so cheap, so don't bother with local transport.'  As an independent traveler that actually enjoys saving money AND spending time with the locals (what's the purpose of traveling again?!?!), I regret the lack of information about local transport.    -The maps in the book, though better than some in past editions, leave much to be desired. Streets are incorrectly labeled or in the wrong place, intersections are vaguely marked, and occasionally they add a street that doesn't exist or remove a street that does. Worst of all, in a region that prides itself on an almost complete lack of road signage, not many good landmarks are given to orient oneself. There is little that is less fun on the road than standing in front of a train station, staring at one's new alien surroundings, being hassled by touts who are trying to steer you in the wrong direction while trying to find that cheap hostel you read about.    Look, if you want a run-of-the-mill book to complete a run-of-the-mill trip, by all means, you will find this book quite helpful.  But if you are looking for that individual experience that is the beauty of independent travel, you might be best going with a different guide for this region.    By the way, the quote I wrote at the beginning should be viewed as a warning rather than an enticemen 
 There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment! 
 I have the tea bags, which are small but very cute and fit nicely into my childrens' tea cups.  I bought the cookies for them to have with their tea, also tiny but cute and the kids love them. Thought a little milk would be nice to have to go with the tea theme... The milk carton is just too funny though.  As small as their food stuff is, this is miniscule, extremely small. Too small really.  They could have made them a bit bigger.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to have a milk carton that is practically as big as a tea bag.  These are just silly.  
 It will be easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. Well Patty Boy I hope you have been training one hell of a camel because otherwise you are going to be mighty hot for an eternity. This man is a intolerant bigot. 
 This is NOT a travel guide! I didn't find this book very informative but rather annoyed by the author's political comments. The entire book is politically loaded, with comments against Chinese government on almost every page of the book. Yes, I know that Tibet is a politically sensitive region and a good travel book shouldn't avoid the topic.  However, the authors goes too far to turn this travel book into a personal political statement. In addition, as a Chinese reader, I found many details described in the book highly selective and biased. The author was trying to demonized Chinese - not only the Chinese government but also the average Chinese people! I bet you'll never dare to go to Tibet after reading this "travel guide" because the place was described like a communist hell! 
 I'm always amazed about people who study the Bible in order to find there errors. They have a lot to say, but it is vanity of vanities. If somebody cares about this topic, try to find "Forever Settled" by Jack Moorman. ISBN 1888328061 
 I was irritated at New Line for not being able to put out one official edition of this movie. They put out the theatrical, then the extended and now a limited edition. It's just a way for them to make more money off of the movie and it's irritating. What they should have done is put out the theatrical and extended together or at least put the theatrical in with the extended version, but nope - they want to make more money off the movie.   I have the extended version and the theatrical, but if you buy this, all you get is one behind the scenes video. I bought this since it had the theatrical and extended on one CD, however, you have to switch the discs over to watch the second part of the movies. I was buying this to avoid that. You're actually getting less as well since there are no other features. You're better off just keeping the copies you have, however, if you're wanting to watch the movies only then this set is good for you. It's a great movie, but like others, I gave it a one for New Line's pettiness at trying to squeeze more money out of a movie and not coming out with an official, one-time version of the movie. Shame on you New Line 
 This book may be useful if you have only a modest amount to lose and know very little about weight loss.  In that case, the advice here -- fill up on vegetables, don't skip meals -- may help you reach your goal.  But, for anyone who has a more serious weight problem, this book may do more harm that good.    Some of the book's advice is so overambitious, it's ludicrous.  For example, the author claims that a good daily exercise goal to shoot for is 20,000 steps of walking, which she notes is about ten miles. She claims this takes about an hour. Just how unrealistic is it to expect dieters to walk 10 miles in an hour?  Very -- it's faster than the WORLD RECORD for race walking.  The book's advice is often contradictory.  Early in the book, the author says that people under the age of 18 should not try to lose weight.  Later on, she says that they should.  At other times, the advice is also lacking in detail. She says one should cut back on fat, but then says eating a little fat with each meal helps stave off hunger.  How much fat is "a little"? She doesn't say.  One section that was very interesting was the part about bariatric surgery.  The descriptions of the surgical procedures and of likely long-term side effects would be quite useful for anyone contemplating this drastic route to weight loss. However, even here the book contradicts itself.  First, the authors says that people undergoing this procedure can expect to lose 30-40% of their starting weight, which would take a 400 lb person down to about 250 lbs; later, she says they can expect to lose 60% of their starting weight -- which would bring a 400 lb person all the way down to 160 pounds.   Perhaps most importantly, the author heavily emphasizes how unhealthy it is to be even slightly overweight, but barely mentions research showing that losing a modest amount -- 10% of starting weight -- has huge health benefits.  This book may leave seriously overweight people thinking that improving their health is hopeless.  In summary, this book may be a useful starting point for people who are just learning how to diet, but is likely to frustrate and discourage anyone with a serious weight problem.   
 I was raised Christian, but very recently have been actively pracicing Buddhism. Although I have rejected many of the belifs from Christian church, I am still trying to reconcile my Christian upbringing with Buddhism. I read Living Buddha, Living Christ a while ago and although the message was simplistic, I enjoyed the book. I was expecting further discussion of Christianity and Buddhism in Going Home, but was dissapointed that it was a disjointed series of dharma talks with the difficult to understand, circular language that many Buddhism books contain and little real content on Christianity and Buddhism 
 I went through the union apprenticeship in San Francisco.  I completed my apprenticeship in 2003, and decided to purchase this book to study for the CA state certification.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!  If all you are looking for is a study tool for the state certification test all you need is a code book.  In school we never used this book, and I went through a 5 year apprenticeship, and after looking through this book I can see why.  I found it almost impossible to use the index, and the table of contents wasn't much help either.  I do however reccomend the National Electrical Code 2005 Handbook.  It cost $25 more but it is well worth it.  Neither of these books will teach you how to be an electrician so don't even bark up that tree!  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!  My 8 and a half years of being a wireman (including 5 years as an apprentice)and I can't make sence of this book.  Don't waste your time or money again DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!! 
 A friend recommended this book to me, so I picked it up.  From the start, I had to force myself to keep going.  I read the whole book, but I wouldn't recommend it 
 I bought this map, having read the previous reviews. And am returning it because it gives a much too limited view of Paris. It literally cuts out whole neighborhoods -- the north end of the 18th, most of the 19th and 20th, the 12th arrondissements(including Belleville, Menilmontant), most of the 13th, 14th, 15th arrondissements including Montparnasse, the Cite Universitaire, etc.   Fine if you want to get only to the hottest tourist spots, but totally inadequate if you want to visit the "tout Paris".   
 I will be a voice in the wilderness here (well, I'm not totally alone, I see some other brickbats, but not many) and say that I have never thought Carly Simon's voice or talent was meant for these songs. 'Torch', 'My Romance', and 'Film Noir' were all terrible albums; this one was a gift to me, or I never would have listened after being thrice burned over the past 15-20 years.   I hoped she'd gotten better at it, or that the reuniting with Richard Perry would help, but no. I love Carly as a pop singer, but she doesn't have the emotional range or feel for the Great American Song Book. She's better than, say, Rod Stewart, but that's damning with faint praise, indeed.  I think folks get caught up in the songs, and overlook the flaws of the singer. These are incredible songs, but they have been arranged, conducted, and performed by others much better suited to interpret them than Carly Simon.  If it has to be 'modern' for you to listen to it, there are current artists performing these songs much better than Simon, but I reach back to Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Anita O'Day, Keely Smith, etc etc. Those folks couldn't sing 'Anticiaption' or 'Coming Around Again' or 'The Stuff That Dreams are Made Of'...but they can do a heck of a better job than these bland, flat, over-orchestrated versions of 'their music. 
 I was so excited when I initially bought this book and honestly, when I read it I was disappointed.  I thought it was a bit dry and boring to read through, despite the useful tips.  Although the authors try hard, they really don't convey the spirit and fun that college life has to offer 
 I picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.  I went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).  Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.  Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.  So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.  Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.  I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.  But you can guess how this ended up.  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  And I never finished the book since it was ruined.  But! I liked the parts I read "okay" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.  Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well.  Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you "keep on keepin on" like they say 
 On the plus side, Paul Campos will make you think about the way our legal system works.  On the whole I found I disagreed with many of his conclusions.  Campos illustrates many of the American legal system's flaws.  However, the biting sarcasm undermines his best points, and then there are the points that seem to get twisted up and abstracted to the point of distraction.  Case in point:  He opens with a lovely breakdown of a small section of the NCAA rules.  The absurdities are duly noted and a discussion of the possible motives underlying the extra language.  He can't spare derision from his tone as he anaylizes the results.    Later he treats us to a very cursory treatment of the War on Drugs.  I thought there would be a lot of room to apply some of the ideas he was making in this specific arena, but he limits his assessment to the political declaration of the War on Drugs.  Without much specifics he waves us to a couple of past historical events, and summarizes that the politicians should have been laughed off the stage.  I didn't find his statements any more convincing than the political speechmaking that launched the war...so...  His legal discussions hold up better (in my eyes) than his straight philosophy sections.  I read the book without being persuaded by the core of his critique.  While it caused me to think, in the end I discounted most of his arguments 
 This book is not for programmer who needs more exlanation They tried to explain everything in shot...  
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 This is by far the worst business book I have read in recent years.  It is hard to believe that Andy Grove actually thought that this material was worth putting into a book.  As other reviews have said, this book at most should have been a short article in Business Week...but even then it would require some actual content to make it worth reading.  The best part of the book is the quotes on the cover from Steve Jobs et al.  It makes me wonder if they even read the book 
 This is NOT a book!! It is a fold of about 25 half-size pages stapled in the center with a cover of card stock printed in black.  The information was totally ho-hum.  Common sense and an IQ of more than 20 will give you the same information with a quick look at the front of any book.  Then there's the cost!!!!!  $15.95 plus $3.49 shipping.  The book would have easily fit into a #10 business envelope and shipped for forty cents.  Needless to say I returned it ASAP 
    More than a year has passed since I bought and read this book, and while I truly dislike spreading negativity, I feel compelled to warn others tempted to spend their time and money on this depressing memoir. The book is mistitled; the author and her feather of friends are neither 'weird' or 'bohemian'. Re-titling this book 'Ennui: My Self-Absorbed America' would properly describe the story told within.     Honestly - from a woman who cherishes my thousands of books...I could not allow this blot on my shelves, or in good conscience donate it...I threw it away.  
 The book was interesting to me because the author speaks about life in the Army. Some soldiers got good and bad experience  during their time. The book makes comments about three diferent soldiers 
 Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely lifeless performance as the interpreter of the title in this curiously flat Sidney Pollack film. THE INTERPRETER is unique as it is the only film ever shot on location inside the United Nations building in New York.   Kidman plays Sylvia Broome, a minority White expatriate from a politically torn racially-mixed African nation. Members of her family have died due to the violence in her native land, and other friends and relatives who have remained behind are backing one or another contender for the Presidency of the fictional country. Kidman becomes the centerpiece of a massive international investigation after she ovehears discussion of an assassination plot against the despotic President, who is scheduled to address the United Nations. Sean Penn plays the govenment agent who is assigned to simultaneously protect Kidman, foil the plot, and find out what she really knows and where she really stands.  THE INTERPRETER has all the elements to make up a grand espionage drama, but Pollack and the all-star cast fail to ignite this film. THE INTERPRETER should have worked but it doesn't, leaving it the sort of film that cries out for a remake the day shooting wraps. The story plods along at an elephantine pace; the willowy Kidman is too morally ambiguous to gain the audience's sympathy; Sean Penn is convincing but cranky. No one seems to speak over a murmur even at the most dramatic moments. The contrivance of a fictional country is far too quaint for the world-is-the-size-of-a-grape 21st century. In the end, the requisite suspense simply never builds, leaving THE INTERPRETER an intelligent, well-made, well-acted, and supremely boring film.  
 The organizer is well made and matched my cabinets and drawers perfectly. However, most of the compartments are stationary, only a few of the pieces are adjustable. I did not have the desired freedom that I imagined when purchasing the product. There is nothing wrong with the organizer itself but it is not as adjustable as I would have liked 
 This is garbage.  This "author" uses the term 'guys' for wiseguys.  It is sooooo anoying that I just had to stop reading it.  Use mafia, wiseguys, whatever.  Try reading the word 'guys' about 20 times a page and see how sick you are of it. this person was not a mob 'guy' so don't bother with this book.  as a matter of fact I will sell you mine very cheap 
 After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price).  
 Les Standiford's Meet You in Hell is ostensibly a history of the "Parnership that Transformed America" between Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie.  The problem with this book begins there.  Its center is the Homestead Strike and labor unrest in an industrial giant and the beginning of organized labor in the face of very powerful and often ruthless business organizations.  The author states upfront his goal was to "focus upoon the thread of a relationship (between Carnegie and Frick)and have restricted my attention for the most part to matters pertaining thereto".  I was expecting a true look into the partnership between the two such as No Ordinary Time by Doris Kearns Goodwin (where she brilliantly wrote of Franklin and Elenor Roosevelt's relationship and the effects it had on public policy as well as their own lives).  I was sadly disappointed.    This book is a short, if disjointed read.  Just over 300 pages and it isn't until the last 50 that Standiford turns his attention to the relationship between these two very powerful and driven men.  The bibliography should be read before one even reads page one.  It is one and a half pages, most undergraduate college papers have done greater "research".  The author at times  seems to derail himself in the rare instances where he might capture the reader's attention.  In discussing in detail the Homestead Strike he states, at the beginning of a chapter, "Had this been a modern-day standoff, with Frick in close touch . . . by cell phone and Carnegie observing the scene via CNN satellite feed . . . ".  This incredibly obvious note was nonscensical.  All history would be different if communications were instant rather than weeks and even months just a relatively short time ago.  Either Standiford is not qualified to write history (certainly a possibility if you see his creditials) or he thinks his readers daft.    This book is only slightly interesting if you would like to learn more about the Homestead Strike and, even there, it adds no real insight.  I finished it only as I was determined to learn more about Carnegie and Frick and, importantly, their parnership.  I did not.  I would caution that any serious readers of history not make the same mistake I did thinking that something could be learned by reading this pithy writing.  It cannot.    Most succinctly put, books about history should be written by qualified historians.  This one was not.  
 Although competently written, Mindbend, at its core, has a plot device so ludicrous that it goes beyond unbelievable... For the record, a young doctor discovers a horrible research material harvesting conspiracy.  When his estranged wife is targeted he must take action, all by his lonesome of course 
 American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her 
 Currey obviously fawns on Giap. Currey has shown no criticil analysis at all in either  confirming or refutting Giap's claims.  He simply passes them on. At times one cannot tell whether one is reading Currey or Giap 
 I believe you are referring to Deu 18:10 - 12.  I make more typos than most..lol.  Anyway, this chapter is addressing the Levites (Tribe of Levi) only.  We should not pick and choose phrases and use them out of context.    Also, if you really want to understand the "Old Testament", read some good research books from the Jewish Publication Society or the Jewish Lights Publishers.  Her books are good, not great.  Nothing new inside but it is a good way to bring Gnosticism and Spiritism to lay people.  Allan Kardec stated most of what is contained in her books in his works.    This particular little book is good mainly for the CDRom 
 Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days.  
 I did not like this audio book.  Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story. In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again. It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man.  It tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again. 
 I'm one of the descendents of Katy Grayson, I've read the book cover to cover, and I was appalled at the mis-information and "selective reporting" that was perpetrated in this book. Claudio indeed obtained information from our family, but as his project progressed, it became apparent he had some sort of agenda to fulfill. The family (who is connected on the Internet) stopped emailing the fellow, lest something we say be twisted totally out of proportion. I think the most glaring example of misinformation in the book is the lack of critical thinking in assuming ANYTHING about the ethnic origins of our ancestress (Katy Grayson's mother), Sinoegee. All we know is, she was Native American, and married Robert Grierson of Scotland in Hillabee, Alabama. Assuming more is fantasy, not history.    I must give Mr. Saunt his due, in that he found many interesting facts that add to my own genealogical research into the Grayson family. I personally have no problems with my great great great grandmother Katy having children with a man of African origin. If any of my distant cousins, descended from "Black Graysons" are reading, I greet you with open arms and hope we can exchange notes. What disturbs me about the book is that it appears to have been written specifically to cause racial strife of some kind. We don't need this sort of book in our society today, I find it in bad taste and a more than a bit disgusting.  If Mr. Saunt wishes to distort sad events that happened 200 years ago, he is a man out of time. Civilization has and should progress beyond anger between the races over American slavery. The Irish and Scots were enslaved by the English in the past. Native Americans were enslaved by each other, and by the Spanish. African tribes conquered their neighbors and sold them for monetary gain and rum. If we were to drag out all the inequities of the past, the hatred would never end. I say, Mr. Saunt needs to let go of his anger, and quit portraying my family history through his selective informational lens. He needs to be more constructive with his research, and quit trying to hurt people by assuming motivations of their ancestors long dead and buried.   Putting it bluntly, Mr. Saunt is a very poor historical researcher, and needs to be more clinical in his fact gathering.   For what it's worth, my family has what is probably the only picture of Katy Grayson, and she is a very dark lady indeed, and very beautiful. I'm proud to be her red-headed descendent. She survived Indian Removal, and ALL of her descendants have nothing in any way shape or form to be ashamed of. We Graysons survived some very tough times by using our brains, and not worrying about the color of our skins.    
 I recieved these for a shower gift on a Saturday, by Monday 1 had already broke, and I mean shatered in the sink, I didn't drop it or anything, but they are very nice looking, just don't expect them to last 
 I was hoping to receive a book about relationships to help  with some classes I will teach.  So, this book about astrology was very disappointing 
 When the first edition of this book came out, it was a breath of fresh air.  It carved a niche in the market by covering not just baseball players but baseball people.  But it also had loads of mistakes.  I had looked forward to the second edition hoping that the factual errors would be fixed.  Unfortunately, very few of them were fixed.  Incredibly, this book still clings to myths such as the story of Ford Frick attaching an actual asterisk to Roger Maris' home run record.  Dewey and Accocella's writing is certainly more consistent than that of competing volumes, so it is unfortunate that they didn't take advantage of the opportunity a second volume presented them to fix the mistakes that are almost inevitable in a first edition.  Also, some of ther additions/subtractions are puzzling - why was Dusty Baker in the first volume and not in this volume when his baseball career has only gotten more significant since the first edition 
 Study an atlas before you go into lab.  You can figure out how to dissect almost everything without a dissector.  If you get stuck, ask a professor, but reference this book only as a last resort.  There are MUCH better ways of accessing certain structures than the instructions in this book.  There is absolutely no reason to have your own personal copy.  The one plus about this edition is that references to other atlases besides Grant's (terrible) are given 
 how in the World that Dave Chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery?? so now that he choked a 50 Million Dollar pay day away he got smart&knows He doesn't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place. this is a Insult to Wattstaxx. that documentary from 1973 was important this is just a mess.  the music Acts on here are lame as well. you want the Big Acts  of today not no Milk carton, Has-beens or non-hit having acts.  the only thing funny about this film is that it got made&was released. glad his corny show is no more. good riddence. this movie is equally bad as well. 
 With as many big names in this I thought it would be amazing....well, it is a corn ball adventure..its set in ancient times yet one man beats someone up, flies off whips out a pair of modern day sunglasses and puts them on and POSES!! (shakes head) its things like this that REALLY hurt the film for many kung fu/hong kong film fans. I REALLY wanted to like this film but couldn't get past the ridiculousness of it. Now corny can be ok at times but this is just rubbish 
 I find it so sad that such a great talent and voice goes into a studio and allows such a bland album to be made in her name. The album is a great dissapointment, the arrangements are harsh and amateur to say the least, the voice is the only shining light on this album, but even that cannot make up for a weak set of songs.  Sorry Agnetha but if this is the best you can do, leave us with the great memories of earlier works.   If you do another album give George Michaels or Rod Stewarts producer a call your talents deserve their ability at the very least 
 I expected Parmalat brand milk but received a different brand altogether. I also excpected this to have a long shelf life, not just a few months. I thought the product was overpriced for what I received 
 This book is NOT good. Period. It does no justice whatsoever to the title that it bears. I feel so cheated that I bought this book and the price is even more outrageous ($148).For instance,nothing,and I mean nothing, is at all compelling, maybe I should say, interesting about its treatment of Simulation (among other topics)in Chapter 10. It is absolutely appalling. Why even mention Lagrange Interpolation,etc when you are not ready to divulge more information, even as it pertains to the design of Thermal Sytems?.I don't think that practicing engineers (according to the editorial review) will be interested in this sort of treatment of thermal systems. In the event that you are interested in the overall picture of thermal systems, I suggest that you take a look at the excellent exposition by W.F. Stocker in "Design of Thermal Systems". This one is targeted at the "higher" audience but is well worth the efforts spent in following it up.  I should ideally give this book a single star but for the rather excellent compendium of engineering ethics in Chapter 3 
 After quickly exhausting the cultural significance of Jello-O boxes in her previous book, SYMPTOMS OF CULTURE, Marjorie Garber has now produced little  more than a book for realtors.  The result is banal and rather  stupid--anything but revelatory.  But perhaps the reader below doesn't take  the criticism far enough: this book has really nothing to say about the  scandalous cost of real estate in most major U.S. cities, the large number  of people who are homeless, and the millions of folks who are gouged every  month by unscrupulous landlords (how sexual is that, Professor Garber?).   Until recently, cultural critics expressed nominal interest in improving  our society.  Nowadays, concerned only about their fat publishing advances,  all they seem able to do is exhibit nauseating complicity with society's  ugliest elements 
 As a diehard Red Sox fan, how could I go wrong with a book documenting the 2004 season?  The answer:  Stephen O'Nan.  He spends more time espousing outrageous conspiracy theories (that MLB is routinely fixing games to get postseason matchups) making up silly nicknames for players that no one else on the planet uses, and generally spouting personal anecdotes that do not provide any insight or even useful description of the famed season.  Stephen King, on the other hand, does a terrific job.  Unfortunately it is O'Nan who provides the bulk of the content.  As a committed baseball fan I routinely found O'Nan's lack of understanding of the subtleties of the game to be infuriating.  Basically this guys is not qualified to be writing any sort of non-fiction book about the sport.  That said, there is one redeeming aspect (in addition to Stephen King's portions) to the book.  It brought back that wonderful season - as I plowed through, I remembered where I was and what I was doing at each critical juncture.  I remebered the anguish and the joy - conjured back by the images in the book.  Worth reading?  I think so - though I reccomend the strategy of keeping the book out and picking a chapter randomly every now and again.  This allows you to re-live the moments with small doses of O'Nan's idiocy 
 The only songs I appreciated were This Gift and Christmas Wish, which were orginals, and very good. The others were all so different in styling, they clashed. You'd get really slow, then it would get lively, then it would get suddenly morose and too serious; I don't appreciate the barber-shop flavor, either. The vocal arrangements didn't suit Christmas at all. I read one reviewer say this album was too slow and sad, and I agree. It's not a 'happy' cd. Really a one star -- one star for effort which I'm sure was present. 98 degrees is a great group, and no one's perfect, but I hope they make a more jolly Christmas one one day. Their beautiful, sincere voices could be so well-suited to Xmas cheer with the right musical line-up. Try Tony Bennett's Christmas Album for a perfectly jazz-ish, jingly Christmas CD 
 Avid fans of Sidney Sheldon will probably enjoy this book.  It is indeed as is noted in the editorial reviews a rough-hewn and crudely carved sequel of "The Other Side of Midnight."  Sheldon does not deviate from the routine trashy forumla replete with cliche bedroom scenes and a plethora of ruthless characters.    Set in the late 1940s right after WWII, Catherine, wife of pilot Larry whom readers first encountered in "The Other Side of Midnight" regains her memory.  She remembers how cruel Larry was to her and how he jilted her for his mistress, Noelle Page.  Indeed, Noelle was the kept mistress of one Constantin Demiris who was written to sound like an ersatz Ari Onasis.  Demiris, like a magician can make those in his disfavor disappear.  Exit Larry and Noelle in the first installment.  In this book, Catherine, the long-lost heroine is restored to glory and is swept off her feet by a man who is loosely based on the cliche Cavalry men.    A psychiatrist and an eclectic mix of patients are thrown into this story; just how they are directly tied into the main plot has never been addressed.  One character who is clearly written as an autistic savant displays some of the more prominent autistic behaviors.  He is echolalic; he recites long chains of information and he knows the number and type of vehicles he passes in route to the doctor's office.  His activities are solitary and few; he does not voluntarily interact with others.  I am really tired of stories like this that portray characters with autism as automaton-like savants with isolated abilities that are far removed from the social world.  I think stories like this do a grave disservice to those with autism and for others who come across autistic characters because it is just perpetuating a stereotype.  This book does not really contain much of a mystery.  It's just ruthless people getting even with each other.  Even good old Demiris' wife Melina enters this story after having been relegated to shadow figure status in the original.  Same old fare.  An attorney who was directly involved in a trial engineered by Demiris re-enters the picture.  Some fancy manuevering, and he runs away with the show.  Literally 
 It does not even sound like Ford and the socalled hits I never heard before and I am old enough to have heard all his hits 
 The book had some moments, but they were few and far between.  I get the metaphor, but then what.  Football as a metaphor for life and war isn't exactly new, and while DeLillo has a nice style I just felt let down.  The only thing I could say about DeLillo's End Zone is at least it wasn't as bad as the Body Artist 
 My almost-6 year old daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a multi-pronged approach, including things like supplements, a GFCF diet, and OT/PT/speech. After a year on the GFCF diet and many specialized supplements and no change in behaviors, we went back to a normal diet with standard vitamin supplements and continued her behavioral therapies.   Our close friends' daughter, now age 4 and also diagnosed with autism, took a similar approach, but even more strict, following the DAN protocol as well as the recommendations of this book, including chelation, a dizzying array of supplements, GFCF diet, OT/PT/Speech, ABA, etc.   While our child has made tremenous advances, or friends' child has not, beyond minor advances related to her age--at 4, she is still non-verbal, far from potty trained, exhibits many repetitive behaviors, and needs constant verbal and visual cues for the simplest tasks.   The point I am trying to make is that every child is different and no one, NO ONE has shown that one course of therapy cures or even convincingly improves a significant percentage of children with autism. Autism, as most of you likely know well, is a catch-all term. Our friends' daughter no doubt has a very different kind of pathology than ours. I have yet to really see a book or study address that fact first and foremost before offering a course of action, rather than immediately launching into predictions of one "cure" for a broad range of issues.   While I do think some of what the author recommends can be helpful (and it really may offer a tremendous help for some children with autism), some of the therapies (like chelation) can be very dangerous--in fact, I have yet to see one of the many families who tried chelation therapy see *any* improvement in their child's symptoms. I have seen more success with GFCF diets (for a small percentage of children), but the greatest success seems to come with comprehensive behavioral therapy.   I certainly understand where families are coming from--I have been there myself, but treating your child like a guinea pig and attempting to "cure" them with multiple substances that have had very little study/peer review in a desperate frenzy of worry is both dangerous to their bodies and destructive to their emotions. As with anything, balance is your approach will serve you and your child well. 
 This follow up to the brilliant 1983 classic "A Christmas Story" is a pretty disappointing affair. The movie does not hold the same magical quality and nostalgia as the holiday movie. Kiernan Culkin and Charles Grodin taking over for Peter Billingsley and Darren McGavin, were no match for the pitch perfect performances of the latter two. Mary Steenburgen takes over Melinda Dillon's role as Mom. The film deals with Ralphie's young childhood in the 40's. Kind of bland and boring. If your a "Christmas Story" fanatic like me, you will be disappointed as well. It's not a bad movie at all, it's just not what one would of hoped it would've been following the previous classic 
 I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor.  First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.    Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course).  Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it.  Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media.  On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working) 
 So I finally rented this tripe as I was curious.  Gee, making fun of former Soviet block nations/people and rednecks.. now there's some seriously funny stuff..NOT! What's next? A cutting edge comedy on the rap culture?..oops, he already did this with the Ali G show. Gross out potty humour, now that's inventive and we've never seen that before! I also like the lame-o attempt to show how Americans are all anti semitic by putting words into the mouths of those trying to sell him something. These are your imagined demons/foes Sacha and overall your film is pretty boring and about as fresh as a Yakov Smirnoff comedy bit 
 The fuss over Forrest Gump still amazes me. This movie basically rips off better movies in almost every scene. Still somehow it managed to win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction And The Shawshank Redemption in 1994. Out of all of the movies that were released 1n 94 this one wouldnt even make my top 20. Nobodys Fool, Quiz Show, The Lion King, and the list goes on. The only reason that I would give it props is for(at the time) was the special effects, which now are dated. After Gump Zemekis directed a episode of Tales From The Crypt where he used the same Technology and was easiest the worst episode of that year. I used to be a HUGE Zemekis fan. Used Cars, Romancing the Stone, Back to the Furture movies and Death Becomes Her were I thought were strong movies. But arounf Back to the Future 2  I thought Zemekis started to rely to much on special effects and it shows on this film. To the objective viewer re-watch this film and think about every scene and try to remember where you have seen that scene before. I guarantee you after you do that you will see this movie in a totally different light 
 This movie concentrates on Cobb as a bitter old drunk desperately trying to get his life story told from his point of view.  I expected to see more scenes from when he was playing ball, but sadly there is really only one scene that showed his legendary hitting and baserunning....and that scene is very short and quite poor.  If you are interested in what Cobb was like as an old angry man, go for it.  If you are interested in Cobb as the greatest offensive ballplayer ever.....skip this one in a hurry.  Other than that, I thought the movie - on its own merits as a movie - was pretty lousy.  I regret buying it 
 Yes i have a book report to do on Across five aprils,by Irene Hunt,in my book report i must write what the charachter looks like ,but in the book  it did not say ,it is very hard to under stand please give me all the  information u can thank  
 I bought a pair in January and loved them. Sound is as lovely as everyone describes. However, there are something seriously lacking in the build quality. The soft wires felt flimsy to me when I first opened it, but I thought I'd just take extra care.   At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off.   I am very disappointed--it is one of the best-sounding phones I've ever had (I've owned both Grado s60 and s90, and sennheisers), but man, they need to do something about making this baby last 
 I clearly did not understand this book at all. I read it based on a recommendation of a scientist I work with who said it was an incredible read, but this came out as one lame novel. Maybe it's because it was written for a previous generation of reader, but Adams's novel doesn't really do anything all that exciting. The premise is intersting enough, Arthur Dent being a human being who is saved from the destruction of the Earth because of the need to build an intergalactic highway. Some of the details are also fascinating (and what saves the novel from being 0 stars in my eyes), especially the way religion and technology are described in such a satirical form, but the book iteself is poorly written, choppy, and frankly unentertaining. If someone can tell me what I was supposed to get out of this novel, please pass the information along.   I really do think that my negative views towards the book stem from it seeming dated in my eyes and how the humorous and sarcastic tone coming out as something quite standard in today's writing world. Maybe the novel was a breakthrough when it came out for the way it viewed the world and the way Adams pokes fun at almost everything, but none of this can cover up the fact that in my eyes, this seems like a poor, finished product, one that relies on its somewhat interesting satirical moments to cover up its other flaws. 
 By focusing on the "legal personhood" of corporations, Hartmann loads a Frankensteinian abhorrence into the term that distracts from more pressing concerns.    Following his advice and eliminating corporate personhood--Hartmann's theoretical silver bullet--might actually increase the protection for corporations by reducing the capacity to tax or sue them.    Hartmann attributes meanings to cases long since altered, abandoned, or circumscribed.  Take "due process" - a key theme.  In the 19th century, corps were indeed afforded "substantive due process." In the 1930s, one application of the notion was rejected (thus permitting the New Deal--after much of it had been tossed out by the Court).  In the 1950s/60s, substantive due process became a doctrine for civil rights.  Yet Hartmann's hostile treatment focuses on 19th century cases, challenges the civil rights amendments themselves as corporate ploys, and his suggestion that corporations "benefit" from anti-discrimination laws and due process could thus set back the cause of civil rights for minorities and women and advantage corporations in the process.  Corporations should be subjected to the same scrutiny as any other human creation, neither idolized nor demonized.  Unfortunately, Hartmann's approach detracts from such an effort and is best avoided as a false guide 
 In my only other review of a Coben book('Gone For Good') I was concerned that he was relying too much on formulaic plots(guy loses girl, goes through hell, uncovers 'deep, dark, secret', and big plot twist at the end reveals all.) Unfortunately, every one of those characteristics is present in 'TNO', and the result is a terrible novel! It's not even good enough to be classed as a 'fun junk food' read. The plot is full of idiotic developments that are meant to be 'surprises', and ridiculously convoluted action/chase scenes. Yet another aspiring screenplay masquerading as a book. I won't even attempt to explain the plot. I suppose the only good thing I can say about the story is it didn't turn out to be another hokey 'serial killer' drama, after all...though that would have been an improvement! There are far too many cases of characters 'keeping secrets' and double-crossing each other...but the 'big secret' revealed at the end is the worst of all, destroying the slim chance that the reader might actually salvage something from this train-wreck.Plenty of other readers have already commented on the ridiculous supporting cast, which seems to be a Coben trademark, alongside his New York settings and poor plotting, so I'll skip them, and hope 'Hester' doesn't mind!  Read if you're a Coben fan, skip if you actually like stories that make sense and lead somewhere 
 If you are a guitar picker looking for a lesson, Redd can give you one in class and taste.  However, if you are looking for the speed and inspiration that Hiland, Lee, and Mason bring this album will be disapointing to you.  The musicianship and sound quality of the recording is second to none but the album is completely lifeless and will not hold your attention.  The instrumental tracks are virtually "backing tracks" that will have you waiting for a solo or something that shows a flicker of life which never comes.  The songs with lyrics are just plain corny, and not in a good Junior Brown kind of way.  The highlight of the album is definetly the steel guitar playing of Jim Murphy.  If you want some kick a** tele pickin' pick up some of the above players I've mentioned, they'll blow you're mind.  Some Danny Gatton and Jerry Reed would do you good too 
 This lock works good for a little while, then the push mechanism breaks.  It may or may not break completely off, so it could still work even when it breaks.  I've gone through two of these already, and they only lasted a few months before they broke 
 Buy "How to draw comics the Marvel Way" instead, as Stan Lee and John Buscema cover all the necessary points in a few pages, as opposed to wasting your money on a book like this. Although kudos to this guy for padding a book this size. He must be close with Scott McCloud 
 There ARE some good ideas in here. Unfortunately I just couldn't get past the fact that it is such a thin book with a lot of rehashed stuff. 14.95 is a lot to pay for a magazine, even if some of the ideas are OK. Also, Ms. Stewart doesn't seem to feel the need to test her recipes out first. When following ANY of her recipes, allow a little extra time for recipe adjustment. 
 I have to admit I didn't make it past the first chapter of this book, for two reasons. First, his insinuation that people who are drastically overweight (which by his definition appears to be more than 30 pounds) don't really care and aren't serious about losing weight. Now THAT's motivation! Second, his recommendation of a draconian 900-calorie-a-day diet, when it's been proven time and again that deprivation diets (just like the fad "grapefruit and steak" diets to which he refers) don't work in the long run. Mr. Watson may be a professional philosopher, but he is obviously not a weight-loss expert (and if he consulted with any while writing this book, I didn't see that referenced anywhere). So while the book may provide some entertaining and perhaps even valuable advice on behavior and life in general, its diet advice should be taken with a grain of salt. Most important, check with your doctor before beginning ANY weight-loss program! 
 After the second reference to the Clint-on s-e-x scandal, I put the book down. I have better things to do than be subjected to a real life wife beater defending the philandering behavior of a wife cheater. Hey that rhymes. Now I can be a rapper 
 A how-to book for reading the future is a product that has had universal appeal for people.  Since ancient times, people have sought to use various methods to gain an advantage, to know what others are thinking and what the future will hold.  Unfortunately, there is no such thing as psychic abilities, and all the wishing and hoping in the world, and all the how-to books that one reads will not change that.  Once people thought they could tell the future by reading the entrails of animals, and by judging how birds were flying.  Now there are a whole new set of fantasies.  One thing, though - at least this one doesn't claim to be speaking to the dead relatives of her fans 
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 I am having to use this book for an Accounting Grad class and it is perhaps one of the worst txt books I have ever laid my eyes on!  Wordy doesn't begin to describe how bad this book is, did this go through an editor or straight to press?  It just goes on and on and on throwing in examples that come later in the chapter, the examples are poor never follwing a simple path, and the questions at the end of each section are as bad as the book.  This book reminds me of someone who decides to teach you something off of the top of their head, they didn't bother to make any notes or set a goal for how they wanted to approach the subject.  Avoid at all costs!! 
 I made fun of my best friend so badly when he bought it. Honestly, I gave it a chance. We opened it and listened to it for the first time together. But halfway through the worst remix ever crafted by man, it was clear, that I would be making fun of him for his poor purchasing decision, for months to come. This is the worst remix every created. It is long and drawn out and has no merit or quality to it. Don't fool yourself into buying something you will never listen to and will hide from your friends 
 The book does nothing but make a lie of itself. There's no leftwinger that hates America contrary to what rightwing propagandists try to tell you. You can't keep complaining about Michael Moore and Dan Rather for being dishonest while at the same time trying to defend nazis such as Rush Limbaugh and Dan Flynn. Folks, you cannot complain about the left hating America when the undeniable reality is the rightwing engaging in unilateral economic disarmament and allowing China and other facist and communist nations to control America's economy and pretty much everything else of it 
 The best thing about this movie was Vincent Corazza. Working with crappy dialog and a plot that tackled too many issues, he did a fantastic job expressing his character's confusing emotions without the need for words. This movie would have been really great had it stuck to the primary plot of a relationship between a married heterosexual man and a gay man. The main plot should have dealt soley with the bisexual issue and concepts of love, rather than bring in HIV, transgendered issues, fatal illnesses, dealing with the death of friends, euthanasia, etc.    Like so many 'gay' themed movies out there, it is morbid, sad, and filled with pain and suffering. Plus it deals with so many psychological issues that viewers tend to get lost and can't connect with any of the characters. Could have been much better. It's worth a look though, for Vince Corazza. 
 Author Miles Harvey describes the bizarre world of map thieves (including explorers, cartographers, collectors and vandals) as "deliciously offbeat," and so it is. Perhaps a fascinating narrative on cartographic crime could be culled from these 350 pages. Sadly, Harvey  structured his book around Gilbert Bland, a petty crook whose life is remarkable only for its sheer dullness. With all the build-up in the introduction, the reader hopes for more.    Also, Harvey can't resist the urge to write about HIMSELF. He constantly interrupts mesmerizing tales of New World discovery with drivelly personal thoughts better confined to LiveJournal. Lest we forget, Harvey is a Professional Journalist On Assignment Interviewing People! And he likes maps, and his mother often cried when he stayed out late, blah blah blah.  Worst of all, Harvey constantly compares Bland and himself to reckless explorers like Pizarro, Fremont "the Pathfinder", Sir Walter Raleigh and even Christopher Columbus. Considering the absolute mediocrity of Harvey and Bland, such metaphors ring false and are in fact ludicrously disingenuous.  At one point Harvey describes the violent fates of certain explorers (including cannibalism, decapitation, mutiny and the murder of thousands). Then--with a straight face--he draws a parallel between these outrageous events and his own drive down I-85 to Hardee's.  I'm NOT kidding.  Harvey makes the case that he and Bland are similar people, and there I must agree. Both are utterly boring people. Bland conned dealers into buying stolen maps, while Harvey conned me into buying this book.  In short, the explorers and cartographers of old make for rich subject matter. Librarians and map collectors of the modern age do too, for the most part.  As for Bland, I cringed whenever his name popped up, and Harvey's self-indulgent reveries nearly drove me to hurl the book against a wall. Too bad "Island of Lost Maps" is mostly about Harvey and Bland as opposed to all those wonderfully weird, historical characters left in the margins 
 Why do you need a water house for a camera that is 10m water proof  
 I rate low the way Julia Lovell write this book: Its seems a revenge against 'China'. You can tell facts, and you can tell facts with anger. I'm a reader of Chinese History. All what Julia Lovell said you can find in History Books, but... the personal taste must be put aside, I think. It's seems a campaign, a crusade against "those who they think they are!!!" Sorry my English is not good enough in order to explain myself in a better way. 
 This direct to video "sequel" is actually more of a re-tread of the original 1998 guilty pleasure erotic thriller/film noir potboiler, and another of the countless, and pointless, direct to video sequels to come from Sony/Comlumbia/Tri-Star as of late (Cruel Intentions 2 & 3, Starship Troopers 2, shall I go on?).  Wild Things 2 focuses around a rich girl (Susan Ward) whose stepfather mysteriously dies, and the only thing standing in her way of inheritance is her high school rival (Son of the Beach's hot Leila Arcieri) who claims to be the man's true, biological daughter.  Naturally, just like in the original, there are plot twists aplenty, as learned by an insurance investigator (Isiah Washington, giving a somewhat inspired performance), and naturally, there are double crosses, murders, and a redux of the first film's threesome, only it's not as erotic as the original's.  Wild Things 2 isn't just a cardboard copy of the original with none of it's good points, it's a solid waste of film that even fans of the original film will hate.  Is it worth seeing?  Depends how much you liked the first Wild Things, but for the rest of us, just watch the original and forget this ever happened 
 Isaac Brock's attempt to pass the mic to this group of Canadian hopefuls has resulted in two things: A. another singer that sings with a lisp and, B. failure to come up with anything original.  Arcade Fire?  THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN???  Not even close.  Do yourself a favor, save your scratch and become a Gary Numan fan instead. 
 I estimate that I have read about 2000 books in my life, and I would rate this as the worst!  The basic principle is that to be at your best, you have to abandon the things that you need to do, like go to work and take care of your home so that you can "get into the zone."  This happens when you enter some sort of "energy spectrum" which aligns some sort of magnetic fields.  I bought this book because it's title seems to indicate a scientific element to self help.  I am a physicist and found that intriguing.  Don't be fooled like I was.  The author tries to use scientific words to substantiate spooky, ridiculous ideas.  WOW, this was bad! 
 This is an anti-intellectual book for reactionaries.  The idea with these people is that their political opinions are "facts" and since they are "facts" they cannot be challenged and must be accepted as history. The agenda behind this is usually to turn history into an intellectual prop for the government and right-wing ideas. The people involved currently want to rehabilitate ideas like the crusades, the idea of "civilizing primative people" through force and the essential unchanging goodness of America. But in the end its not about history so much as it is trying to create guidelines for how history should be presented and taught.  The book also wants to bring a sort of morality into history.  All conflicts are to have a good side and an evil side.  Taking an example from american history, Vietnam was a "good" war done for the "right" reasons.  The vietnamese who opposed America and anyone who opposed the war in the US is therefore by definition "evil".  There can, in this view, never be two sides to a conflict.  There are only good people who must be helped and evil people who oppose them who must be destroyed.  There is good and evil in history, but overplaying morality as the book proposes leads only to turning history into national propaganda.  Then the author goes into the virtues of "old fashioned" ideas.  In American history, the first old fasioned idea is the civilizing mission of America on the frontier.  The book wants to go back to the days were native americans are "savages" in the way of the march of progress and civilization.  Where colonialism exists to help the inferior peoples of the world reach a higher level of civilization.  And where every history sweeps inconvenant facts under the rug to promote the goodness and virtue of the country.  Its a history of propaganda and not much more.  The far left and the far right are each just as bad as the other.  Each wants to take history and use it as a weapon to re-educate the broader society.  The lesson should take away is that history as an academic discipline can't really work when the people in the field (right or left) use it as a political weapon.  The conflicts the author sees are not conflicts about "facts" or "history" but political conflicts where there is no easy answer.  History as an academic subject can only work when the facts presented are accepted by the overwhelming majority of those being taught the history 
 This deck is odd, to each his own, I suppose. Firstly, swords and wands are transposed, with swords representing fire and wands representing air. This would be OK to work with, except the card meaning are not representative of the elements....the meanings of the swords are still equated with knowledge, intellect, thought, justice and truth...but are now associated with fire, rather than air. The wands cards represent creativity, action, movement, enthusiasm, and career....but are classed under the element of air....this is rather confusing to new readers who are used to the Rider-Waite associations.  The hierophant as elephant?? Surely that must be a joke.  I just can't take this deck seriously. I'd call it more bizarre than inspired. 
 I did not find this to be very helpful in planning for my upcoming retirement.  To be fair, I have looked at several retirement advice books and not found any to be of much help. 
 Like other reviewers listed here, I thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and Child's life.  To be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and Child fan I wish there had been more.  I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close.  The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.  Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write!  Forget the food, it's just not you.  Stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next Nora Ephron, or at the very least, Erma Bombeck. 
 This book seems to be comprehensive in its treatment of digital audio but unfortunately much of it is simply cut and paste from more technical articles with little attempt being made to digest and explain the material in a more accessible fashion.  For example the material on error correction on CD's hits the reader over the head with equations that come out of the blue and the reader couldn't hope to understand in a month of Sundays.  The material on analog to digital conversion is much the same. Nonetheless this book serves as a compilation of relevant topics in digital audio but fails to provide the reader with the intuition to really internalize the material.  
 This book is probably a better read in the paper version.  Sandra Burr's male voices are somewhat shrill and detract from the story.  Not my favorite narrator.  Susan Ericsen's reading of Coulter's The Maze was better. 
 Even as dedicated of a Radiohead fan as I am, I really don't care much for this album. I say thank goodness for "Creep" because we may have never heard from them again (or at least not in the same way) if that song had not become as popular as it did 
 same old same old cliche after cliche. bedroom scenes , restaurant dining scenes, marriage counseling/group therapy scenes, theater scenes, buying magazine scene, taking care of baby scenes, chasing car-toll scenes, i-love-you, i-love-you-not scenes, marriage & commitment phobia scenes, public declaration i-love-you, adultery+affairs scenes, without-you-i'm-not-complete scenes, wedding scene, all-the- audience-stay-nobody-left-all-applaud scene.....on and on, you name it. all of these deadbeat storyline, plot, dialogue, settings, scenario....have been played and replayed, scripted, directed again and again, either in new  york or in l. a. million times. too formulaic and stereotyped old broadway + hollywood modes. please give us something a little bit new, okay? 
 Here's an update to one of this sell out's quotes about Hurricane Katrina:  "About five years ago, in a debate before the National Association of Black Journalists, I stated that if whites were to just leave the United States and let blacks run the country, they would turn America into a ghetto within 10 years. The audience, shall we say, disagreed  with me strongly. Now I have to disagree with me.  I gave blacks too much credit. It took a mere three days for blacks to turn the Superdome and the convention center into ghettos, rampant with theft, rape and murder."    Wow that's really showing some LOVE and compassion for the victims! Never mind the fact that the blacks who were not doing those things shouldn't be lumped together with those who did! This man is heartless towards his own people which is really sad! He's very much out of touch and a white a** kisser!   This is the same man who said that blacks don't need reparations because they should be happy with all the opportunities they get in this country! Never mind the fact that reparations is a **debt owned** and not a handout! Never mind the fact that blacks still face discrimination in this country! Did he have a problem with the Jews getting reparations along with all others except blacks?   Now this sell out is pointing the finger more at the black mayor of New Orleans, never mind the fact that the governor has more power than the mayor! Yet all this man does is attack blacks from left to right! Some white person must be paying him to do this!   I agree with some of his points about immorality in the black community and greedy black "leaders" but what this man needs to do is come up with some solutions instead of the childish finger pointing that's just going to cause even more trouble!   I have to agree with some of the folks who posted negative reviews of his book. This man is one self hating Uncle Tom and one reason he mentioned being called an Uncle Tom was because he asked a black pastor that why instead of handing out condoms to his congregation why doesn't he just promote abstinence, which is good since the fact that condoms aren't 100% proof but what this man is not giving the pastor credit for is that by passing out condoms free just like they do in clinics, he's still promoting safe sex and that he can't force folks to practice abstinence so at least he's doing something. But since this Peterson sell out thinks that blacks are good for nothings then he probably doesn't care to see us procreate! Maybe that's the real reason he wants blacks to practice abstinence!     
 This is the longest textbook I have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that. I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior. You'll actually begin to understand how investment really works, without getting bogged down by the numbers, terminology, and jargon 
 (2 & 1/2 to be exact) I have no ideal, why I've choosen to write a review on this particular movie. I'm not really a fan of comedies & after watching this I can see why. However, All in All, the film has been well made, and luckily doesn't divulge into valugarity & offensiveness like a lot of recent comedies of this sort have -well maybe a little but not a lot. The actors are all likeable - unfortuntely I can't say that with some of the characters they portray. Catherine Keener is one of my favorite actresses but she doesn't use her trademark sardonic wit and sarcastic humor like in a lot of her other movies (i.e. Being John Malkovich, Your Friends and Neighbors) but she still manages to come away from this subversive comedy with a well likable character. OK, not to spend to much talking about this film: With all there is likable about this movie, for some reason, it just didn't gel with me. Oh and by the way: I too know a few people like the character Steve Carell portrays in this film and you know what: THEY'RE ALL HIGHLY INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUALS. Sure they lack social skills and the right relationship, but why - in this country especially - is that so F&cking frown upon. IF I HAD THE CHOICE OF BEING A Sexaholic Hearthrob & a vastly intelligent person, I would choose the latter. SEEYA 
 Guys, I respect Pavel, and he has a tremendous reputation in the power-training world.  I was really excited to begin the routine in P2P, but it only took me three weeks to WRECK my lower back from the deadlifts and my right shoulder from the side presses.  I'm a strong, healthy, 26-year old guy with about a year of freeweight experience.  I paid very close attention to Pavel's directions, and still got injured.  There are safer routines out there 
 This book would be overpriced at half of the $69 it cost.  If you remove the advertisements, the self-promotion and definitions (which are good), there is only a third of the book devoted to repair and then only cleaning, etc.  Another failing is no table of contents or index to locate specfics 
 From the moment Celeste met her adoptive's father father...I knew there would be trouble. Not only didn't we find out if she were pregnant...which would have made for an interesting twist...she never heard from the boy she gave her virginity to again! I was really disappointed in this story 
 this book can damage your family relations if you adhere to the author's advise. do not blame others only but look at yourself too. if you do not, you could find yourself isolated very quickly. read more than this book and get other ideas and concepts. the more i read, the clearer it became how isolated the author is in the landscape of self-help books. 
 I am continually amazed by the reviews that show up here praising Bob Hoffman, obviously by people who never really knew him.  The fact is that Bob Hoffman did more damage than good for the entire Iron Game, even his pet sport of Olympic Style Weightlifting.  And Hoffman via Dr. Zeigler was instrumental in popularizing anabolic steriods (see article by Bill Starr, a former York employee in the current issue of Iron Man)  Hoffmans presence at AAU sanctioned bodybuilding events gave the sport a black eye by the mainstream media. The 1956 AAU Mr. Universe held in Virginia Beach, VA was a perfect example. Hoffmans actions at an event that could and should have done a lot of good for the sport had the opposite effect. Sports writers in the mainstream media critized the event and bodyuilding as a whole. Hoffmans retort was classic; "I think bodybuilding is sissified and I am trying to get it shut down." Great PR for our sport eh?  Hoffman was notorius for handpicking winners in AAU contests. Hoffman was the AAU and acted liked a mafia king. In the Virginia Beach contest, Hoffmans protege was in fourth place so Hoffman changed the judges making himself and Paul Anderson judges. This enabled Hoffmans protege to move from fourth to first. Hoffman and Anderson even had the audicity to put Olympic Weightlifter Chuck Vinci ahead of Ray Schaeffer, the then current AAU Mr. America who would go on to win the prestigious NABBA Mr. Univers a week later against better competition but with better judging. Schaeffer would end up in second place in the AAU Virginia Beach event thanks to Hoffman.  A similiar atrocity happened 9 years earlier when the AAU arranged for Steve Stanko, a York employee to win the AAU Mr. Universe over better competitors like Eric Pederson and George Eiferman. Stanko had won the AAU Mr. America a few years earlier in a similiar fashion. To his credit, Stanko was the first man to total 1,000 lbs in Olympic Weightlifting. Catch the connection?  Hoffman took on anyone who dared enter the muscle game and for any reason. His battles with Joe Weider, Dan Lurie, Rheo H. Blair and even Charles Atlas were classic. Hoffman wanted a monopoly. And Hoffman was quick to copy ev en after he criticized. For example, Weider came out with the highly successful Crash Weight Formula XR7. Hoffman debunked it without basis in issue after issue of his rag magazine for years and then finally came out with his own version. Guess what he called it? Crash Weight Gain. First attack then join. Of course Hoffmans product was more sugar than protein and didn't work as well as Weiders.   In the early 1960's Hoffman via Dr. Zeigler introduced Anabolic Steriods to the York weightlifters. They made fantastic gains but Hoffman tried to give the credit to special Power Rack Training, a new piece of equipment that Hoffman introduced at that time. People like Bill March, Luis Riecke, Tony Garcy, Bob Bednarksi and more made fantastic gains. We now know the epidemic that has been caused with steriods thanks to Hoffman. (See current issue of Iron Man)  The people writing positive things about Hoffman are undoubtably Hoffmans relatives or people who mindlessly bought into all the bull that Hoffman perpetrated for nearly 40 years. Or perhaps they got a FREE HI PERTEEN (The way Hoffman pronounced Hi Protein) shake.  I met Hoffman back at one of the York Picnics and at the AAU Sr. Nationals and AAU Mr. America Contests that were held in York. I met him before he went senile. He seemed somewhat amiable but with an attitude and it was obvious that he did all this for his own merit. He had some interest in Olympic Weightlifting.  Terpak was a complete jerk. John Grimek on the other hand was delightful to talk to and obviously genuinely cared about the Iron Game and it's followers. He was a great champion who was unfortunately used and abused by York and Hoffman.  Fortunately, in the 1980's the York Empire fell apart. Strength & Health, Hofmans flagship rag folded in 1982. Muscular Development would have followed soon after but was bought. Powerlifting and Olympic Wightlifting  formed new federations that really cared about the sport and had real athletes in control. Likewise, the IFBB severed it's ties with the AAU after only about 3 years replacing them with the better NPC and actually had bodybuilders running the sport, and disgarding the AAU like yesterdays garbage.  AAU bodybuilding shows would then eventually go the way of carnival barkers.   Hoffman did more damage than good for the Iron Game and for the few people who still think Hoffman was a saint and that York BBC was so powerful or that the AAU was the "legitimate" organization, I ask you, where is York BBC today? And where is the AAU today?  Bob Hoffman, York BBC, AAU, good bye and good riddance! The sport is better off without you!     
 Having gone to Harvard and Harvard Law School, I can easily attest to the  fact that not all students and faculty are, as the author notes,  "really smart people". If you actually have a brain that can  actually THINK and you don't need to some ideology telling you what to  believe and how to act, then you'd soon realize that Christianty is simply  an ancient means of explaining how the world works. If you read this book  and are a Christian, please don't let the Harvard factor make you feel more  justified in your beliefs 
 This book completely leaves out their political writings.  If you want to learn about their artistic beliefs it's a good book, but it has none of their (important) political writings.  
 The author of this book should be arrested, lobotomized and sent to Gitmo for the ludacris assertions he makes.  Without the Federal Reserve, how would Citi et al be able to handle the problem of reserve requirements should people want to take cash out the banking system?  Poorly thought out arguments, Mr Hubbard.  Verdict: 2 stars only because there was a good picture of Keynes' charming smile 
 This book is not a great value.  It does not explain German grammar with the clarity found in April Wilson's "German Quickly" or even Sandburg and Wendell's "German for Reading."  It is particularly weak when explaining prepositions and the extended adjective construction, and it does not give pragmatic advice about figuring out the various crucial elements in a German sentence.  Moreover, the exercise sentences are dull, and not worth the effort needed to translate them.  This book is a classic mainly because German teachers are too lazy to seek out substitutes 
 18 May 2006  If I had read that the book was based primarily on those interviews, I might not have read this book. The authors really don't have deep insight of Google. Part of it could be because the company has guarded its privacy well. Still, for a book on Google, it is very disappointing as one can probably find out more juicy information about Google by using the search engine itself :-).   Appendix II has a copy of the Google Labs Aptitude Test, complete with Test Code. It is nice to see that, though I think I would have failed the test and therefore has no chance of working for Google :-). 
 What started as a wonderfully inventive work went downhill after about the halfway point. Too many plot points depended on one character overhearing something important. I finished the book a week ago and while I remember the characters and the situations, I can't recall what happened at the end. That says something 
 Living Things is very disappointing. The previous CD, Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, was such a powerful collection of songs, written and recorded with such clarity and immediacy, a rock classic that is truly one of his best efforts alongside Girlfriend. Living Things is touted as Sweet's return to a fully produced, thought-out album. It even has Van Dyke Parks...so it must be a slice of Wilson-esque classic pop, like In Reverse...right? There's only one problem: the songs. Living Things rings very hollow musically, and lyrically it is hopelessly bleak, the actual opposite feeling of the album's title. This is not a sunny pop album, it is a dark series of resignations on the hopelessness of life, with almost none of Sweet's humor to balance out the darkness. It just feels like a bad head trip. I have listened intently to this disc, in various settings and states of mind, and have come up short every time. The material is lacking a heart, a center of gravity. Yes, it has all the external elements of Sweet's pop sheen: the overlaid vocals, the guitar textures, the power pop grooves. On the surface, it all sounds attractive, but underneath all the layers is empty, bleak music. It feels like "Matthew Sweet by the numbers."   Moreover, Living Things is supposed to be a more "produced" album than Kimi Ga Suki, and yet it feels sloppy and unrehearsed. Only a couple of the songs have a proper "ending" or even a fade-out. Most of the tracks sound like demos, with haphazard sloppy endings where the music abruptly cuts off as if the band were only rehearsing the song and decided to quit before the end. This is not a well produced album, to be honest it sounds unprofessional. And the fact that there is no booklet, no lyrics, also shows that Matthew wanted to put this CD out "on the cheap," which shows some disregard for his fans, in my opinion. Girlfriend, Altered Beast, 100% Fun, In Reverse, all of these discs have always had some form of lyric booklet. Even with Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, there was a booklet with liner notes by Matthew, a sense of personal involvement. But on Living Things, nothing. Just the tracklist and personnel. I detect a disinterest on Sweet's part, a lack of concern for our reaction to the sloppy song endings, the redundant material, or the lack of any liner notes or lyrics. Matthew seems essentially absent from the whole operation, from the packaging to the songs.    One reviewer compared this album to Altered Beast, which also had a more densely layered production style, a more "experimental" album than, say, Girlfriend. But at least Altered Beast still had a very high calibre of songs: Dinosaur Act, Ugly Truth, Time Capsule, Life Without You, Reaching Out, Falling. There is nothing on Living Things that stands out as a memorable song in the end. It all sounds like a series of hooks and textures that don't go anywhere. Another example of a more "produced" Sweet album is 1999's In Reverse, which has the Spector/Wilson "Wall of Sound" production on some tracks, but again, it works well because Sweet wrote a solid collection of SONGS for that album. Hide, Split Personality, I Should Never Have Let You Know, Write Your Own Song. These are all true gems in Sweet's catalog. And once again, Living Things fails to produce even ONE song that rises above the surface exterior in order to make a lasting impression. Really, I cannot think of even one song that stands on its own merits. "You're Not Sorry" and "I Saw Red" are probably the "best" tracks, but even those songs only sound like hollow imitations of much stronger material by Sweet on previous albums. He's covered all of this ground before, with much better results. For an album called "Living Things," it all sounds lifeless, a collection of dead shells. Attractive containers with nothing inside. 
 This book is more about his autobiography, and albiet amusing at times, isn't a real investing book. His other one: Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World is much better 
 The wrong item was sent. There are 2 items with the same title. Advances in Economic Theory I and Advances in the Economic Theory II. The description of the book was very vague and I was unaware of the existence of two version up until I received it 
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 I watched as much as I could stand on PBS before concluding this was not a classic 19th century novel unknown to me but a poor recent imitation, and came online to verify that.  Anyone who is enjoying watching this has presumably never seen anything based on a really good novel, like those by Dickens, Dumas, or even Wilkie Collins. What ****!  I refuse to waste my time even to see it through to the end.  This is only for people in the current generation raised to observe frequent violence rather than intelligent plot and conversation.  It is not terrible, but not worth watching if you have anything at all worth doinng with your time 
 I really wanted to like this book.  In the end however, reading it was strikingly similar to getting my younger sister to describe the latest Harry Potter book.  It is disjointed, unorganized and consistently confusing.  The authors of this book can't make up their minds what to focus on.  The number of times they utilize the phrase "we'll get to that later", makes you want to scream to nobody in particular: WHY DON'T YOU GET TO IT NOW?!?!?!  This was a fantastically uneven and dissappointing read.  Too bad 
 The author seems to have a problem with the Beatles coming along and leading singers/musicians to write their own songs. He also drags out the old "monkees ruined their career by firing Kirshner" crud that music critics have been regurgitating for years 
 This book had some potential at the beginning but bombed about half way through..I am surprised at the favorable reviews here..The story is very weak and almost eerie considering it was published pre-911..I am amazed that J.P.'s publisher didn't hand the manuscript back to him and tell him to rewrite the ending..The ending was probably the worst I have ever read..In fact, if you decide to read this book, skip the last 10 chapters and write your own ending..I'm positive you'll do better than Patterson did 
 Whether you view Cons as "conservatives" or as "con artists", this book offers the same tired platitudes for fixing their America - push more and more market risk onto the poor and give corporations greater privileges and more tax dollars.  It's just not worth the time 
 Oh how I wish for a balanced view.  For all of his past credentials as an investigative journalist, Mr. Hersh is no biographer. The network of sources and investigative attention to detail that exposed the horrors of My Lai and made Mr.Hersh's reputation become nothing more than a platform for a commercially-motivated thrashing of a flawed man who happened to be president for less than 3 years, forty years ago, and whose greatest claim to fame is that he was assassinated in highly suspicious circumstances - thus entering a uniquely American form of popular-mythology. Mr.Hersh contributes nothing that is substantively new to our knowledge of JFK. His book produces a litany of "evidence" to support the well-known view that Kennedy was seriously-ill for much of his life and often resorted to heavy drug use, was a political animal who made much use of the often dubious network of contacts that his super-ambitious father had developed and was an insatiable womaniser behind the veneer of a "respectable marriage". The book makes no serious contribution to anything other than Mr.Hersh's bank account (and that of his publisher) because it seems that anything that is written about the icons of American popular culture, whether good or bad, is destined to be a commercial success - all the more so when it is written by a "respected investigative journalist" 
 I was given this book by a sales manager wearing a disturbing rhino tie tack.  The book might be of use if your sales staff was made up of six year olds.  It is a painfully simple read with some silly pictures and nice big print.  Nothing innovative or inspiring here.  
 Musty, dated, old boy humor of the kind floating around breakrooms and water-coolers. This stuff wasn't funny when the vaudeville hacks were doing it. I like Mr.Asimov, and probably would have been somewhat charmed by his delivery(maybe). All in all, read Benchley or Woody Allen again for literary laughs and leave Asimov for the 3000 other genres he dabbled in 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 The following can be said about this album...rare?  All of you who are contemplating the purchase of this album should look the other way.  Chances are you already have all of these songs (except maybe Proud).  A final thought would be this, 'rare' doesn't even describe the album cover.  Turn it 90 degrees counterclock-wise....ever seen George Romero's "Land of the Dead" 
 I bought this recording with high hopes.  What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?  Well, not with this recording.  The cast is made up of "distinguished actors," the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line.  The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!  When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  For audio recordings, you need the best voices.  Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this.  My advice?  Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums 
 I have serious misgivings about the facts presented in this book.  The original French text was written in the 20's.  I was given this book as I am working on a masterwork on the cultural history of Olives and Olive oil.  In this respect she often jumps to the wrong conculsion, and makes broad judgements that have been discounted by anthropology since the 1960's. For instance she lists oil stores in ancient Babylonia as being olive oil.  We know from further scholership that this would have been sesame oil, and that olive oil was a fuel and not a consumptive in that culture at the time.  This causes me to question the entire book.  This may be an interesting read, but at least with respect to Olives and Olive oil, there is much better out there 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 I had water rockets like this when I was a kid in the early 1970s.  The rockets were no different from the ones that come in this package.  They shoot high and straight and are loads of fun.  My only gripe is with the pump.    When I was a kid, the pump was heavy plastic and metal.  The pump on these new rockets is cheap plastic.  The knob on the end broke off the first or second day.  My son and I are still able to shoot the rockets, but we have to carefully stick the knob back on each time we want to pump up a rocket.  
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 Iles tries to imitate Michael Crichton with bits of Dan Brown's Digital Fortress in this book.  Unfortunately this book does not make it.  The NSA is backing a project called Trinity which is to develop a super quantum computer that is controlled by a brainscan of a human mind.  Two of the individuals involved with the project want it halted and one dies in an apparent stroke which was actually induced by the NSA bad guys (why does the NSA always have to be portrayed as the bad guys in these books?).  David Tennant is the other individual and he gets away by stopping an unstoppable hitman and then persuades his psychiatrist to run with him, even though she thinks he is mentally unstable.  The plot really gets out of hand with Tennant having visions of being Jesus, being portrayed to the Secret Service as the next Oswald and escaping the entire Washington DC police and SWAT units and ultimately getting out the country with a false passport, going to Israel and then persuading the head of the Moussad to help him.  As crazy as it sounds the end is literally unbelievable that would even make a James Bond fan cringe.  The author has written some great tense books (24 Hours, Sleep No More) so I just chalk this one up to an experiment gone awry. 
 This book should be targeted towards those who have no idea where to get started and are just tossing around ideas.  Don't be under the impression that you'll run your business with this book 
 As soon as I bought it I realized it doesn't hold the phone too well. Few days later my concerns proved them selves, every time I made a rapid movement or tried to run with it (even very carefully) the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground. Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it, untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me. There goes a $200 phone, lost because of a stupid $10 holster.  Do not buy this product, if you realy need a holster go with something like Sonyericsson's "ICE-26" that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosn't slip out of the holster. As for me I gatta get me a new phone, shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it 
 I ordered this and The Favorite Game, taking advantage of Amazons buy two and get a deal policy. I didn't like this book at all. It doesn't feel as natural as Favorite Game, it doesn't flow like FG and doesn't delieve like FG.  I don't know what Mister Cohen was trying to accomplish... James Joyce or Henry Miller lost generation of Montreal? The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is solely on my adoration of the author 
 I was rather diappointed in this collection.  A few of the poems are very nice, but overall the work is bland and dull.  The language is so pedestrian.  This seems like a real half-hearted attempt at writing.  I am  sure Walker can do better 
 And what are those words?   Why, simply put they are:  "DENZEL WASHINGTON IS NO FRANK SINATRA"   Any questions?  No, I didn't think s 
 Written to obscure rather than illuminate.  Effectively makes simple subjects seem complex.  Skip this and buy anything by Ansel Adams instead 
 The idea of a nice warm wipe is great, but the product falls short in perfomance.  The warmer is designed for a non-popup type of wipe box. (If you use pop up wipes, just the part sticking out of the box gets warm, and the rest is cold.  If you use the other type of wipe box, it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full, which isn't always realistic for a moms and dads.  I am returning mine to the store.  : 
 This book is a good example of a completely outdated view on diet and nutrition. If you wish to know what people thought was a balanced diet and nutritious in the 1950's, then by all means buy this book. If you are looking for something a bit more contemporary, find another book that has a more healthy view on carbohydrates and sugars and preparation of healthy meals without highly refined or processed ingredients 
 As an active duty chaplain in the military I had a significant interest in chapter 9, Priests and Padres.  First, I was amazed at the number of references and her ability to read, organize, and synthesize them into a narrative.  These references, however, are derived from a significant number of ministers writings or sermons, which became the framework for her conclusions.  Furthermore, multiple references, representing several wars, are devoid of their cultural-historical context and woven into one sentence or paragraph leaving the reader to think the behavior, concept, or issue is timeless and characteristic of clergy.  I don't consider the chapter a valid historical analysis because of the limitations of the source material.  What the chapter does provide is a summary of her sources convictions and behaviors-which is not the whole story.  Since I considered her conclusions in chapter 9 highly subjective I did not read the rest of the book 
 Well, uhm, it happens to be true. Pete Townshend wrote some powerful, beautiful stuff for THE WHO BY NUMBERS. I wonder if anyone really understands how moving and how deep that numbers like "Imagine a Man" and "They're All in Love" really are? Well anyway, Pete goofed here big time, as did the rest of the band without Keith Moon as their drummer. Sad situation that was. There once was a band called the Who... So although they messed this up big time, there are of couple of funny (yet still pathetic) songs like "Cache Cache" and "How can you Do it Alone?" that justify its puny existence. It is sad and quite poignant that the Who had to break down like this, but check out their back catalogue for great material and you'll find that in reality they could have easily stood up to any of the world's greatest bands. 
 This book is painful to read.  The writing is clear, but it is so boring and repetitive that I can barely bring myself to pick it up.  It seems like a majority of the time she rambles on about issues that aren't even specific to technology, and are, as another reader suggested, common sense.  Unfortunately I have to read this book, since I am yet another CS major taking a required course in ethics related to technology.  The subject isn't bad, the book is 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 Well, the title says it all.  Where was the editor on this?  The first rule of writing is always to keep your reader's interest.  I think major points of the book could be made less often to reduce repetitiveness.  And less written on points that are kind of obvious - like "Taxes impair wealth accumulation."  I tried reading just the summaries, but the book is more than just that.  I got it out of the library, but I ran out of renewals.  Even so, the ideas are VERY important to consider, so everyone should make an attempt at it 
 In a nutshell: Don't waste your money on this version.  The original version of this translation dates to just after the turn of the century, but the introduction and further editing by Anatol Rapaport (a biologist and a musician, not a political scientist or historian), make this a clumsy read at best and downright misleading at worst.  Rapaport, for being an editor of Clausewitz, was not a believer in the trinitarian system (primordial violence, non-rational actions, and rationality)- probably not a good choice for a work which owes as much as it does to the first and second Trinities (army, people, and government).  If this is the only one you can get, then live with it.  The first chance you get, get the much clearer, much more straightforward Paret/Howard translation, which is the one that's actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it

 Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib.  I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing.  I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead.  :- 
 After reading the reviews of the book, I expected much more.  The e-book really just whets your appetite with generalities (e.g., about the internet or globalization) summarized from the full-text version.  One could get far more from a typical on-line article in Fortune, Business Week, etc.  The e-book version is 9 pages of about 14 font text, double-spaced.  I guess that this would calculate into about two or three pages of a regular book.  I would still like to read the full-text version but I would advise avoiding the e-book version 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 Microsoft's development groups appear not to talk to one another, and for Internet Information Server that longstanding bad habit is a critical problem. IIS intersects systems, programming tools and applications (Windows Server 2003, Visual Studio and Internet Explorer). The Resource Kit is written from a systems perspective and has little to say about the other main actors. With the introduction of Visual Studio 2005, release 2.0 of the .NET framework, Small Business Server R2 and most recently Vista the material is badly outdated.  [...] As with other items written by Microsoft marketing staff, it is heavy on coverage, light on technical information and hard to use. Unfortunately IIS is a niche topic and so far has not attracted a skilled and knowledgeable writer who can integrate the several technologies and perspectives needed to explain it. 
 Someone must be suffering from cold feet.  The Iraqi army has dissolved and disintegrated and regrouped into small widely separated divisions, up to now incapable of organized performances, least of all policing Baghdad.  The world ridiculed the idea that Saddam had amassed weapons of mass destruction (now ironically referred to as `had the potential capability of possessing WMD' - you see! the legend `potential' was simply added to give an evasive answer to the question `why has the UN decided to remove Saddam?'  Now we listen to bits and pieces of a so-called `Saddam's court martial', where Saddam has been exhausting the court but never exhausted, engaging everyone in heated arguments, until the judge was on the verge of losing his temper. Indeed he lost it and dismissed Saddam.  Saddam won the day!!!!  It was a great personal victory for Saddam. Of course no one has any means of knowing who's really speaking the truth. The coalition forces believed they had at last a revealing insight into the state of Saddam's mind after his dishonourable capture, but the way the ex-president is treated in court leaves a lot to be desired.  Many responsible officials after Saddam were about to commiserate on their heavy responsibilities despite the support they have been getting from the `strongest power on this planet'  I saw the look of dismay in the eyes of those who read this prematurely written book; perhaps the author thought that Saddam would be a dead corpse by the time this epistle had been published.  Who knows! And Iraq, in the absence of as strong a government, is still in terrible predicament. The battle for Saddam Hussein is virtually beginning. To many laypersons in the Arab world, the `story' does not seem to be finishing soon, and the author will have to revisit the last four years brimful with additional important material for his readers. 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 I don't understand why we are being sold extra tracks in here that were not "extra" but a part of the original album. The order is all messed up. They could have done a better job. The album cover is so small. What gives? This is one of the best albums ever and it deserves better 
 As an avid fan and owner of every book she's published I was VERY disappointed in the storyline, plot, sub-plot, character development (actually lack there of), dialog, I can go on.  When the story moves into dream sequences it's disjointed, choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour.  I haven't finished the book, I have no desire, inclination or motivation to.  I stopped reading the book a week ago and haven't felt the urge to pick it up again. I am barely 1/2 way through the book.  I feel like I wasted money.  I feel robbed 
 As usual, NT Wright has missed the Correct Answer in his quest to shore up the fading structure of Christianity.  In the Publisher's comment: "the early Christians' belief about the afterlife belonged firmly on the Jewish spectrum, while introducing several new mutations and sharper definitions."  In Judaism of the first century, there were many Resurrection cults.  The Pharisees believed in angels, demonic spirits and resurrection of the dead.    Again:  "How do we explain these phenomena? The early Christians' answer was that Jesus had indeed been bodily raised from the dead. No modern historian has come up with a more convincing explanation."  Sorry, but we HAVE come up with a more convincing explanation.  The Resurrection cults were looking for new victims.  When they heard about Jesus, they started telling people that "Yes, we saw the resurrected Jesus."  Because they were dishonest, even dangerous cults recruiting victims... I mean, members.    It's the kind of lie that a Resurrection cult would invent.  Even Paul said that Jesus was only the first-fruits of an imminent General Resurrection in 1 corinthians 15.  If Mr. Wright would stop trying to con us, he would have to admit that a LIE is simply a more convincing and believable explanation for the resurrection appearances of Jesus.  
 What can I say about Eva Peron that hasn't already been said? Her unparalleled power & beauty have become legendary and so has her bad reputation. Was she really as ruthless as her notoriety leads us to believe? It depends on who you ask and what you read.   John Barnes biography has been translated to several languages and it has been re-issued several times but this is not an accurate biography of the enigmatic and now mythic Eva Peron. There are too many inaccuracies that just fuel the myths and Barnes' account reads more like a tabloid. It's a watered-down, less hateful version of Mary Main's "The Woman with the Whip". Both biographies are very similar in tone. The main difference between the two is that John Barnes does give Eva Peron credit for some of her accomplishments especially with her foundation. Main, on the other hand does not and she cites greed, hatred and megalomania as the reasons behind all of Eva's achievements. Main also accuses Evita of being personally responsible for the atrocities committed by the state police during the first Peronist period knowing full well that there isn't the slightest shred of evidence. She even states so in her book ("There is no proof"). John Barnes doesn't and for this I give him credit.  One of my complaints with the newer versions of John Barnes' biography is that the epilogue is omitted. Those who are interested in purchasing this book are better off getting their hands on a good used copy of the original instead. The epilogue is interesting because despite the author's negative portrayal of Eva Peron, it clearly demonstrates that when all is said and done, the administrations that followed Peron and Evita were far worse. Even by the opposition's point of view. Barnes does a side by side comparison between Videla's chaotic Argentina of the 70's to Peron's less destructive and more popular form of government. He states that Peron may have had some of his enemies imprisoned but "they all came out alive". That is not the case with later Argentine administrations where thousands were systematically locked up, tortured and killed. Even children and the elderly were not safe.  Having read countless biographies of Eva Peron in both Spanish and English, both pro and anti-Peronist, I can frankly state I know alot about Eva Peron including all of the myths surrounding her persona. In my opinion, the best biography of Eva Peron in the English language is Nicholas Fraser & Maryssa Navarro's informative and well researched book. Like Barnes book, it has been re-issued several times under several titles, the most current being "Evita: The Real Life of Eva Peron". JM Taylor's "Eva Peron: The Myths of a Woman" is also helpful and well documented and Robert Crassweller's "Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina" is well researched, well-written and is one of the best Peron biographies available anywhere. There is a huge difference between the woman portrayed in the books I mentioned above and the heinous character depicted here. The Eva Peron that John Barnes presents to us was an extraordinary woman but incredibly ruthless, vain and unpleasant. It's the exact same Eva Peron portrayed in the erroneous musical that bears her name. Like many other anti-Evita biographers before and after, Barnes is clearly fascinated by Eva Duarte despite the harsh character flaws he sees in her. Mary Main, Tim Rice, George Bruce, WA Harbinson, all have written scandalous and in some instances down-right malicious books about the woman and display her as an ambitious monster who squashed anyone that got in her way but for some reason, they did not hate her, at least not to the extent you'd expect. Why is that? Was it because she was a woman? Was it because she was so young and beautiful? The director of the stage play, Harold Prince stated that in his opinion Eva Peron was a "villian" corrupted by power but something about her drew him to her and he cited her gender as one of the reasons. Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber stated that Evita was "extremely attractive" and possessed qualities that were admirable despite being the most "unsympathetic" character he has ever written music for. For those like Prince and Webber, who consider Eva to be an amoral, murderous dictator it's hard to believe that they would feel any kind of sympathy towards her but like Barnes, they do. Eva's youth, gender, glamour and charisma have a lot to do with it but in Eva Peron's case it's something more. There is something about her that intrigues even those who despise her and that is rare. One should also keep in mind that if Evita has become "immortal", her detractors are as much to blame for this as her admirer's. John Barnes' book tries hard to condemn her but in the end, it loves her to pieces.  "Evita First Lady: A Biography of Eva Peron" is an entertaining read but it's too flawed, too historically inaccurate to be considered a good biography. Maryssa Navarro, Nicholas Fraser, JM Taylor, A Dujovne Ortiz, Robert Crassweller and a countless others have done better. Give their books a try before committing your time to this unless you are more interested in reading a more sensationalized and imprecise narrative of Eva Duarte de Peron's life story 
 In need of a fun, adventure read, I picked up an author I always seem to see on the shelves - Cussler. It was a fun, easy read, but I expected better from such a prolific author. This is a book I would have loved when I was 14 years old, but have now come to a be a bit more demanding of realism. I found the syntax and grammar of the narrator to be very poor, which detracted from the book tremendously - I was left wondering if the editor just rubber-stamped this one.  My main issue with this book was the sci-fi level of belief suspension needed to get through it *Spoilers*: 1) fully functioning artificial intelligence robots able to carry out casual conversations, circa 1993  2) Japan has secretly created a perfect missile defense program  3) an adventurer/underwater researcher sent in to take down a heavily defended fortress, instead of a trained team of SEALs/Delta/etc. 4) That a Japanese tycoon created over 100 nukes from one salvaged "Fat Man" atomic bomb from 1945.  5) That a super-secure vault would have a convenient ventillation duct large enough for a man to squeeze through.  6) Robots that drive cars 7) several ridiculously convenient coincidences that save the day  8) the usual near death witty comment, etc...  all in all, kind of fun, but don't think much or you'll ruin the plot. 
 This is one of the worst attempts ever seen at being an authoritative sourcebook.  The author references himself, often in this very same book, numerous times throughout.  Nothing new here as every entry is culled from other, better sources, and many of the excerpts are shallow at best.  Overall writing style is poor.  Do yourself a favor and pass this one up.  If you recently bought it, return the thing and save some money with which you can buy some decent books on lycanthropy.  Whatever you do, do not take Brad Steiger's words seriously.  Of course, it *could* be good for a laugh or two, but what little bit of rubbish isn't 
 i hate this book this guy did something. that he shouldve went to jail for life he is stupid. this book is so easy i read it in 1 hour. i think he should go to jail if he beats someoone up agian and go to jail for life.     This book is a wast for people to buy or read!!!!!!!!!! 
 It was my reading book for a subject called "Community psychology". Maybe it is because I am from country (Poland) which had hard time with communists and socialists and this book has to offer nothing more than bunch of pseudo-scientific theories and some "liberal" babbling. There is no social science background, most "research are based on some strange  theories (mostly Marksism). If you want to learn something usefull about social psychology and phenomenons concerning it read "Social Animal" by Aron. This  book is laugh, not science 
 depiction of "reality", and then there's the perverted vision of Larry Clark. Being a fan of Bully and by no means someone who shy's away from sex in media, I was thoroughly disappointed by Clark's latest offering. No real plot. Just a hodge podge of unusually dysfunctional characters connected only by their age and their locality. One can't help but think that the constant theme of adolescent sexuality in Clark's films is indicative of some personal demons and temptations the director must be grappling with. You can argue that many of the over the top characters and scenes in Ken Park do exist and take place in real life and you would be right. There are mother's cheating on their husbands with teenage boys, there are overbearing religious families that inadvertently push their kids to the opposite end of the morality spectrum and there are certainly kids who kill their parents/grandparents. But what's the purpose of the movie's characters? To demonstrate teenage angst and they way people push the limits of sexual boundaries? To see that you'd be better off watching an hour and a half of Jerry Springer epsiodes which would arguably have as much continuity and plot development as Ken Park.    
 On its own merits, Stone's book deserves only one star, but because it has brought Socrates to the attention of a wider audience than he otherwise would have it gets a second star.  Maybe Stone learned Attic Greek in order to write this book, and maybe he didn't.  Nothing Stone wrote in this book required analysis of primary sources or any depth of knowledge of Attic Greek, in contrast with the truly scholarly work on Socrates, which often turns on the evaluation of subtle stylistic and linguistic evidence in the ancient sources.  Stone's methods are those of the advocate, the special pleader, and the polemicist, which of course is what he was for his entire journalistic career. He was clearly not a scholar, in spite of his pretensions.  He would have fit in quite well with the clever Sophists Socrates had so much fun arguing against, and so little respect for.  Perhaps Stone had a grudge against Socrates because  Socrates would never have taken Stone seriously had the two ever  met.  Socrates would no doubt have taken Stone apart just like he did everyone else he encounters in Plato's Dialogues.  The idea that Socrates could have used a "free speech" defense at his trial in ancient Athens is preposterous.  The Athenian democracy quite frequently fined, exiled, or put to death its citizens for the flimsiest of reasons.  One has only to read Thucydides to learn this.  There was no First Amendment in  ancient Athens.  Athenian law was whatever a jury said it was on any given day.  It was for good reason that pure democracy as practiced by Athens developed such a bad reputation that it has never been seriously tried since.  A good antidote to Stone's screed is the paper by Gregory Vlastos called "The Historical Socrates and Athenian democracy", which appears in his book "Socratic Studies".  Vlastos also wrote a critical review of Stone's book in The New York Review of Books.  It should be noted that Vlastos identified himself as being Leftist in his personal political views, but didn't let that interfere with his scholarship.  And I doubt that he ever let KGB agents take him out to lunch 
      What could have been a great story, superheroes going undercover in a foreign land, ends up being poorly executed.  The painted art is often dark and difficult to follow.  The story is muddled by a non-linear narrative which doesn't flow through past to present, and requires a new character to come in and explain the whole plot to the characters and the readers.  Not the worst thing I've ever read, but I couldn't recommend it, either. Go get David Mazzechelli's and Paul Aster's City of Glass, instead 
 All homeschool books that are hardcore Christian need a warning label - right on the front cover and probably on every page too.    Meaningful church involvement is a necessary ingredient for homeschool success?  I have to have a biblical conviction that God has called me to homeschool?    I guess I have to forget about homeschooling then, since neither of those apply to me.  Then she gets into curriculum and tells you to save yourself some time and settle on a traditional curriculum (if I wanted a traditional curriculum I might as well leave my kid in public school) designed for Christian or public school use.  That's great if you want a traditional curriculum.  But there are FAR more curricula out there than the Christian and traditional curricula she suggests.  And a great many kids have been successfully homeschooled using other than the "traditional" method.  Seems like she could at least have mentioned that fact.  On the last page I read before I could read no more, (which was about a third of the way in), she notes that instead of attempting to meet any state-mandated objectives, one should strive to realize God-given directives.  However let me warn you - if your state requires certain criteria such as standardized testing that you fail to do since it was not a divine directive, be sure to get a lawyer because the state will take you to court.  If she had only titled this book The Ultimate Guide to Christian Homeschooling, I think it would have been great.  All of us non-Christians would have avoided it and Christian homeschoolers would probably get a lot out of it.  There is a tremendous amount of information in it that is of value - if you approach it from a hardcore Christian point of view.  But if you DO NOT believe (as I DO NOT) that children are in desperate need of training if they are to grow up to bow their knee to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, then give this book a pass 
 I've heard Mr. Ziglar speak in person and he was very humerous and captivating. Wish I could say the same of his Autobiography. He detailed his youth and his family to the boring extreme. He spoke very little about the type of work he does now - only about all the job changes he went through. Maybe I expected too much; but after hearing this man in person I expected much more 
 This book is just a clever rehash of his other books but just repackaged under "POWER AGING". Some of his books contain the title Gary Null Phd. and other books just say Gary Null- so this time it is "Phd"- the book jackets NEVER say from what University. Many of the supplements pluged in Null's book are sold by his company Gary Null Associates so it is hard not to look at this book as just another product placement. The idea that hundreds of  millions of people of diverse cultures should eat a specific way is ludicrous. Gary Null writes his book as if he has all the information, but scientists still do not have much of the answers regarding aging, yet Gary gives the impression he knows everything there need to know about health and mega- antioxidants may become pro-oxidants in the body. He sounds like the Jim Jones of health gurus. Gary Null knows that his diet is nearly impossible to follow for the normal average person working 8 to 6 pm 5 or 6 days a week and he creates products that fill the need. Instead of eating all those lbs. of organic vegetables and fruit each day just take his expensive concentrates and supplements and watch Gary Inc. get richer. CASE IN POINT: FOR OVER 30 YEARS GARY CLAIMED THAT CHOCOLATE WAS TOXIC AND AS BAD AS CONSUMING MEAT OR COFFEE-NOW HE SELLS A 'NUTRITIOUS" GARY NULL CHOCOLATE BAR!   
 The software to this MP3 player made it too much work. Anything that freezes up my computer has to go.   Here's my experience.  I purchased this player on February 23rd and returned it to the store on March 8th. I was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try. I installed the software with no problem, but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players. I just didn't like the look of it or how it categorized the music files. I did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine. It had a very nice sound, easy to use and wonderful to carry around. I listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge.  Fast Foward Week 2  I wanted to delete some files and add some new ones. I opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as I did at first. First, the program began running really slow and then froze. I ctr/alt delete and started over. It worked for a second and then froze again. I rebooted and it did the same thing. I came back to it the next day and it did it again. I uninstalled it (so I thought), and it continued to freeze. It doesn't completely uninstall off of your computer. I know this because I didn't have to "re-authorize" my computer to use it again. I had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer. There are lots of hidden files.  In conclusion, had it not been for my experience with the software I would have kept the player.      
 I searched all over for this book. It was even recommended through a business brief published by Business Reference Services Humanities and Social Sciences Division Library of Congress in 1994. So you could only  imagine my dissappointment when I realized this book simply lists a bunch  of addresses over and over again and gives you almost nothing to go on. I  got much more out of a 35 page booklet entitled Your Guide To Free  Government Grants than I did from this over 350 page book. I truly felt  dissapointed and would not recommend this book to anyone searching for a  grant 
 'A Voyage to Weirdness' is a more apt title for Lindsay's classic. There is a lot I didn't like about this book though the ending did redeem it somewhat. However, it took over 200-something pages to get there and I'm still not sure if it was worth my time.  For one thing, it seemed as though Lindsay made his world as weird as possible, not for any special meaning, but simply for the sake of weirdness. That's fine in itself, but it worked to make everything pretty meaningless on the whole. Consequently, it was slow plodding along through paragraphs of description that seemed to go pretty much nowehere and have no relevance to the main story. Parts of the world sounded downright juvenile and made me wonder if I was reading a book adaptation of a sci-fi B-movie.  Another problem I found was that, even though I can bring Lindsay's world to mind down to the minute details, I found myself cold towards the characters themselves. Maskull himself had no redeeming qualities to actually make me feel for his plight and by the end of the novel I found I had forgotten all about him. This may have been intended, but it the whole novel left no impact on me.    Despite all this, however, the ending was unexpected and did make me slightly glad I read through it to the end. Lindsay's was clearly intending a message with this novel, but I don't believe he completely succeeded at it. When taking as a whole, this novel could have been exceptionally better and much more remarkable if Lindsay could have stuck more to the meaning of his  story instead of bogging it down with endlessly weird descriptions that went absolutely nowhere. 
 Fresh in my grief, I found this a hard book to read. It has a lot of text book information and probably is very helpful later in grief. But, it reads like a text book and I found it hard to process when my grief was so fresh 
 sadly i feel tricked....yes michael buble can sing but the cd is short and the songs are not so good. reading other critisims posted  i see my feelings are shared 
 This is by far one of the worse things I've ever heard. Right up there with Chingy or Changy or whatever it is. They should be ashamed. It's a miracle that can say "Laffy Taffy" and still show their faces in public. For shame for shame. For the record, D4L, to para-quote your own lyrics, No "I can't do it it like you" nor would I want to. I would never suck so bad. 1 Star here it comes 
 This adapter worked fine for charging and for sound output, but be aware of some key limitations:  1) This adapter is too large to fit into many docking stations. I found I could only connect it to other items using iPod cables.  2) Although it will charge and allow one to play music from the iPod, it doesn't provide full functionality. When I connected it to a computer, my Mac did not recognize the shuffle. This was the case whether or not I'd pre-launched iTunes.  So, if all you want to do is connect your shuffle to a car transmitter/charger or other cable-based device, this adapter is fine. If you want to use docks or make your computer-connected iPod cable do double-duty for your shuffle and for your other iPods, this isn't the solution for you 
 This book can be written by any person on the streets who only have the most basic medical knowledge. I have the feeling that this was not even written as a medical thriller as the relavance to medicine was at a minimal level. Boring and stale at most parts of the story and the ending was fairly predictable. Please, read this book only if you have too much time to spare and too much money to waste on a tasteless book 
 Since I am a patent attorney specializing in computer-related inventions by trade, as well as an avid photographer, I consider myself extremely well-versed in computer technology and digital photography.  I have been using digital cameras and Photoshop for years.  Suffice it to say that I am not in any way, shape or form a "beginner."  I bought this book in order to learn advanced tips, secrets and techniques that would allow me to improve and streamline my workflow while processing my images using Photoshop CS.  However, this book is poorly written in the extreme.  It seems that almost every other sentence refers to a step, process, function or Photoshop menu item that the author fails to adequately explain, thereby leaving the reader with more questions than answers.  Every few weeks or so I keep trying to plow through another section or chapter in the hope that the descriptions and examples will get better.  But it never does.  I have yet to finish a single section of the book and think to myself, "okay, now I understand this particular concept."  Most often I am left clicking around Photoshop menus and searching for options in dialogue boxes trying in vain and with much frustration to find and use some function that the author says should be used but failed to explain or show. Most often, the author does not bother to give any examples of what he means when he says you should use some function or process buried behind 2 or 3 levels Photoshop menus.  This has turned out to be a complete waste of time and money 
 Due to the size of our turkey this year and the haphazard job of getting turkeys out of the roasting pan all prior years, this item became a major hunt for us (It was sold out everywhere locally).  Unfortunately, the rack was less than a good thing.    The end result was a burn hazard, "non-stick" coating flakes stuck to the turkey, three hours of cleaning, and a rack that rusted due to the loss of its coating onto the turkey.  In detail: The first discovery was that since the roasting pan itself was relatively larger than the rack, it allowed the whole rack to slide around inside the pan, throwing things off balance to a great degree and undoing any light covering (like foil) that spanned the pan.  Several foil corrections later and everything went into the oven, slipping around and endangering me with scalds against the oven itself as I had to attempt to right it.  I should have taken the sliding as a hint and reconsidered.  The danger from putting the item INTO the oven was nothing compared to the hazard of taking it out as it slid around with a now-very-hot turkey inside a now-very-hot pan.  The rack performed as advertised for ease of lifting the turkey out of the roasting pan.  Removing the center pin proved to be a two-person endeavor, with one person holding both sides of the rack and the second pulling the pin.  This is the only thing it did as advertised.  We discovered the flaking off of a good portion of the non-stick coating onto the turkey itself to be the next issue.  We discovered that the "non-stick" coating really isn't non-stick as being another thing to consider.  Cleaning the thing proved to be one of the largest washing challenges I've had to undertake.  The rusting out thereafter makes this a one-use product for us.  As a caveat, the sliding and burn hazard can be mitigated by having a roasting pan that is much smaller or finding a method to stabilize the rack inside toe roasting pan, however after examination of the tight curve and bow of the rack and potential solutions, my wife and I could come up with nothing for ideas that most reasonable people would care to undertake.  The curve and height means that a smaller pan would need to actually have substantial height and/or be small enough to hold the base securely, but not contain the upper portion fully 
 I personally love Mariah, but she makes fool of herself in this movie. Babe, stop acting and just stick to singing: that's what you're doing best! 
 I was disappointed with this book. He has his picture on every other page, literally. The numbering of chapters is confusing. I truely have gotten much more out of "Strong Women Stay Slim" by Miriam Nelson, which I got from the library, and now have purchased. I would suggest taking a look at Jorge's somewhere before making your purchase~ (do as I say, not as I do LOL) "Strong Women" just seemed so much simpler, and the drawings of the exercises are pleasant and clear. Often times I don't want to do the exercises, then I think "well, I'll just do the first one" and before I know it I've done them all and am feeling better. In fact, I have now ordered Nelson's book on arthritis. Note: There are only 6 basic exercises plus stretching in Nelson's work, so it certainly doesn't take much longer than Jorge's "8 Minutes. 
 I wrote a detailed criticism/ critique of this book, but it didn't get published...??? So here's my concise re-review: The authour spends far too much time plugging his own web sites and software than giving deep suggestions and information. This book may be ok for novices w/ AdSense: a few good tidbits here and there, but frankly, you can get far better, far more reliable and far more UNBIASED information from Google's AdSense homepage and the myriad blogs etc. on AdSense. I'm very suprised that the overall feedback for this book was as high as it is! Save yourself the money, go to the source at Google directly 
 This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:  1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.    2.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.    3.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to "shiver", which is very frustrating.    Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.    Jim "Konedog" Koenig, astronomy buf 
 Terrible, terrible, terrible.  OK if all you want is a small spotlight or a nightlight.    I wasted money on buying TWO of these bulbs that I will NEVER use!  I do want to see better LED samples in the marketplace, but THIS one has GOT TO GO!  Too bad I didn't check the reviews on Amazon before spending over 60 bucks on TWO lightbulbs!  I'm an IDIOT 
 The subtitle of this book, The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa, is completely deceitful.  There is nothing biographical in this book about either one of its main protagonists.  It is rather a chronicle of the Japanese film industry, not without interest in itself.  However, the voluminous facts, tid-bits of information about every minor actor, director, script-writer, and film composer, as well as the synopsis of every film mentioned, makes for increbibly tedious reading.  While the book has its merit as a source of information, not much credit should be given to the author other than for his ability to put together facts that are available from a number of sources.  Meanwhile, reading all these capsules of data will leave you dry when it comes to the lives of Kurosawa and Mifune.  The author tells us nothing about how they lived, felt, thought, behaved,what motivated them; probably because he doesn't know himself.  A simple gathering of public facts, none researched by the author himself because their sources are many and widely available, especially on the internet, do not make for a worthy book 
 The oval Rival crockpots have a design flaw. The lids do not properly fit. This causes condensation to leak out of the pot and onto the counter. I am not able to leave this on if I will be leaving for the day, because I am afraid that all the water will ruin my countertops and flooring (It really creates a large puddle!) I contacted the company but they didn't respond. I highly discourage the purchase of this product! 
 I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives.  I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big "Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" from me.  For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.  They are worth the time and effort 
 I bought this book based on backcover info. What a disappointment. It's not just that it is poorly written and unimaginative. Unless you are into sleazily written sex and gore, you won't find much to hold your interest. There is nothing new here. Just tired, sorry, second rate prose, thinly drawn characters in a porno-lite storyline. Save your money 
 Oh my goodness me where do I start? This book is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The writing level is comperable to that of a 7th grader. The story is very poorly told as well. The writer tries to make herself sound talented by using similies and metaphors at the most awful points in the story. The story could've been interesting if I was written nicely, and was more in depth of events. This book gets too much publicity than it's worth, and this is probobly only because of the subject matter. The book starts off with Lalu, poor Chinese immigrant who was sold multiple times in China, and was starving. Once she came to America she was fed plenty of food, but unfortunetly, she was a sex slave for an evil Chinese Saloon owner. This is where the story gets uninteresting and stupid. She's then sold off the Charlie, a good friend of the man who brought her to the town she resides in. Then it just tells us what happens to her life after all of this. Maybe I didn't like this book because of the subject (Immigrant books never really were my favorite), but the poor writing style sealed the deal for me. Your money is better spent on something else 
 And was just as palatable.  I've enjoyed this series from the begining but could barely get through this book.  If I'd wanted to read Peyton Place I would have checked it out of the library...the mystery was more of an aside with the obvious solution coughed up at the end.  Extremely disappointing 
 My husband and I were really looking forward to this but when it arrived and we started to watch it it was just too dated and lost our interest immediately. We should have payed more attention to the date of this series.  We were expecting something more to the caliber of the Lewis and Clark series. It was just too hard to watch indians with english accents and great grammar. Also, the color was really faded.  All in all we would not recommend investing in this series. 
 After listening to the previews of some of the songs on this website I have deemed this album "bad" or "not fly". I suggest you spend your money on arcade games or fountain soda at the mall. Or if you do buy it, spend your remaining change on some glue so you can at least listen to it higher than a kite 
 We were excited to find such a good deal. The clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse. The home charger never worked. The car charger works, so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package. One thing my boyfriend and I learned through this experience, is to pay for known quality and performance, in the long run you save money, hassle and time 
 About halfway through this book I wanted to rush through the rest of it so I could write a review about how horrible this book is. The writing is solid and good, but everything else about this book is awful. Ms. Daswani's first book, "For Matrimonial Purposes," was considered sacred by my friends and my, Sindhi girls destined for arranged marriages while living in a modern world. Her second book wasn't as good as her first, but still mildy entertaining. This one has no redeeming factor.  This book tells the story of Tanaya Shah, a Muslim girl that leaves India for Paris in search of a Sabrina Moment, and becomes a model. There is nothing to like about Tanaya. There is nothing to like about any character in this book. Tanaya is written without any personality, any real character. Only in the end, when she gets really angry, do I feel even a glimmer of affection for her. Her family is awful, Tariq (the man she was meant to marry in Paris) is an idiot, the people she works with are annoying.  So much of this book is offensive and horrible, especially to an Indian girl like me, and I hope Ms. Daswani decides to make her next heroine stronger, more interesting, and a better representation of Indian women around the world 
 NOTE: Watch out - the batteries blow up, when used with the AC adaptor !   So, what is the point of plopping down $500 for this radio - there is not much of interest on shortwave anymore, one can buy a $25 Radio Shack model 12-898 digital PLL AM/FM radio for AM DXing (THE E1 DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN INTERNAL FERRITE-BAR ANTENNA, OR COME WITH A SATELLITE ANTENNA !), and one can buy a satellite radio for $50, now. Also, after getting $500 in-the-hole, one gets to shell out a monthly fee for satellite radio, plus an activation fee - a bigger ripoff than cable T.V. ! Evidentually, there are major technical problems with the actual satellites, so its future is in question !   So, what is the bottom-line ? Well let's see, $500 for the radio, probably another $100 - $200 for the AM and satellite external antennas, $9 - $12 monthly fee, and the activation fee. Is this another blunder by Grundig/Eton/Tecsun, or a total ripoff - I suspect a bit of both ! So, $500 for a receiver that does not even receive/process IBOC for AM/FM, or DRM for SW !  This baby, I believe, is assembled in India, while the rest of the Grundig/Eton/Tecsun junk is made in China. I wonder, if the E1 is as cheap as, the Grundig S350 ?  This is a copy of a post from gearlog.com (the BBC and "Voice of the Andes" are now gone, too):  Shortwave Eton E1 Posted by: Larry N.  Monday, October 31, 2005 8:03 PM  David,   I am shocked your would recommend this new radio from Eton.  Honest?, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT? It does not have Digital Radio Mondale! Who in 2005/2006 would spend $500.00 for a top of the line portable without it? In few years the shortwave part of this radio will be useless. DW is leaving analog shortwave by June 2006. Radio New Zealand by the end of December 2006.   I would hope you would admit your mistake and if not withdrawing your recommendation at least make note of the lack of Digital Radio Mondale and why that is important!   73  Larry  
 ...not a musician.  What I see in the negative reviews is a desire for Rod the Musician to return to old form. What I detect in the positive reviews is an enjoyment of Rod as an entertainer. Some people value musical chops and creativity- others simply want to be nostalgic and entertained. Rod converted long ago from  musician to Vegas entertainer.  If you want a taste of some old rockers who remain creative musicians, sample Robert Plant's or Neil Young's latest. Don't waste your time on Rod or this kitsch 
 Don't get me wrong -- this is a great product; however, $27.97 for shipping from Amazom or $7.95 shipping from Office Depot. Whatsup with that?  Is Amazon tacking on a $20 handling fee?  I ordered directly from Office Depot and now it makes me wonder how many of my other purchases from Amazon were the same 
 Why do I own a thunderstorm CD? I don't know. I guess I thought it would be something different, something ambient and *natural.* This disc has one long, poorly-recorded thunderstorm, followed by 23 lighting strikes. None of it is worth buying or hearing 
 Maybe I'm getting spoiled with the recent output of historical profiles that have the narrative quality of great fiction, like Caro's LBJ series, Chernow on Hamilton, and McCullough's books on our founding.  Given that high bar, Newmyer's history of Marshall is a very difficult read.   This book plods along.  When discussing a principle the court dealt with Newmyer often makes it impossible to keep track of what year or even decade he's referring to, making it difficult to put the principles discussed into the proper context, especially political context.  I also felt the book was very biased, glorifying his conservative nationalism without really defining why his brand of nationalism should be considered conservative rather than liberal or even non-ideological.    This book would prove helpful in a Constitutional Law class discussing certain principles and their historical development, especially the rise of Corporations, but only with the guidance of a Professor who knows the era and Marshall's court well and only in small doses.  I'm a sucker for books about our founding ideals and the history of our framers, but this was torture and with no obligation to finish this book, I finally gave up about ¾ of the way through, which I rarely do 
 I opened this book without having read a single review, armed solely with the knowledge that it had won the National Book Award.  I wish I had been armed with a paper shredder.  For such a rich and potentially captivating topic, Tuck did a horrendous job.  The life of the beautiful Ella Lynch, mistress South America's most enigmatic and charismatic tyrant, should have provided us with cutural and personal insights beyond a standard history text book.  For example, I would have liked to have finished this book with an understanding of how Francisco Solano Lopez managed to inspire 60% to 80% (depending on your source) of his country's inhabitants to die in a war which had absolutely no rationale.  Instead, I got a good solid dose of the Latin Lover.  Tuck did her research, but not to a greater degree than any high school student.  At no point in the story did I gain an understanding of the causes of the war, or of the unique political and social position held by Paraguay in South America at that time.  Not only did Tuck miss the broader context--the political rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, the constant power vacillations of post-independence South America, the struggle to establish national identities--she completely failed to establish the character of Paraguay and Paraguayans.  This is as unforgivable in a historical novel as failing to develop the characters (a feat which Tuck also manages to accomplish!).  Not only did Tuck do a slap dab job with South American history, her writing was consistently poor.  Long botanical lists which had no relevance to the plot (what little there was), letters, diary entries, which were all meant to provide the reader with verisimilitude, merely slowed down the prose.  Short,almost cartoonish, sexual encounters between undeveloped characters, one-paragraph vignettes, strange graphic violence, all gave a disjointed quality to the prose which made it tempting to skip paragraphs, if not whole pages.  Last, but not least, the author clearly does not speak Spanish.  This wouldn't have been a problem had she employed the services of a native speaker to check her error-ridden manuscript. (And where, pray tell, was her editor?)It was highly irritating to wade through grammar mistakes that a first-year Spanish student could have caught and corrected.  All in all, a highly disappointing read 
 This was the first book I got for my husband upon learning we were pregnant, and he found it to be quite condescending.  For example, it has sections entitled "in the doghouse" that give men helpful hints like not calling one's pregnant wife a whale.  Of course, this has become a running joke in our house...but do most husbands really need a book to tell them not to insult their wives?!  It focused more on telling men how to behave towards their partners than on helping the understand their own journey towards fatherhood.  Overall, this book seemed to assume the worst about its readership, whereas I would assume that men who choose to read books to prepare for fatherhood are already caring and committed to being good husbands and fathers.   We found a lot more useful information and a much more respectful and supportive tone in "The Expectant Father," and I would recommend that book instead.  
 Wells is a wonderful writer, it is true; however, his bigotry and hatred of certain peoples and of religion is very apparent. His political leanings are also too apparent--it is not an unbiased book and may give some the wrong impression of world events. I am currently reading the book updated just after WWII 
 I have read all buy 1, and felt this was the weakest.  It was still good, but lacked in a lot of ways.... 
 Unfortunately, this application includes only a Mac OS 9 (not the Mac OS X as advertised) version.  I cannot review the cds in general, as I cannot run them.  Why did they re-publish the 1998 software in 2006, again in Mac OS 9?  Frustrating 
 Instead of writing a review I am citing an error that I observed in  reading the book.   On page 141, Mr. Davis states that Bob Marley had a  daughter named Kimane. He had a son named Kymani, who is now a singer and  recording artist 
 "Journey to the West" is a literary masterpiece which has been loved in China for nearly half a millennium.  In contrast, "The Lost Empire" is a piece of meretricious rubbish which will hopefully soon be consigned to oblivion.  Its makers seem to assume, rightly or wrongly, that its audience will be unable to relate to a "foreign" story unless a white guy is inserted, however incongruously, into the action.  As if this were not bad enough, the idea of the "hero" comducting a romantic affair with Kuan Yin must be deeply offensive to many people of Chinese extraction.  Since Kuan Yin is someimes compared, in her role as compassionate mediator, to the Virgin Mary, one can only imagine the response had the situation been reversed.  This is an example of film-making at its very worst 
 I bought this toy for my 9 month old son for Christmas. He loved it and it is a wonderful toy. However, in mid January it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit. I replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still wouldn't work. I tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing. I had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon. They responded quickly and it appears that I will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that I may take my chances and buy it again. There are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine 
 We were expecting this movie to be about Idi Amin, not his personal physician, a spoiled rich Scottish lad who came to Africa to have free sex with everything that walks.  After failing to get another doctor's wife to sleep with him, he takes up with Amin as his personal physician, accepting an expensive house, expensive sports car, and a lot of new tailored suits while the rest of the country lives in poverty.  During this time, he barely does any "doctoring" and becomes an extremely unlikeable character, just not quite as unlikeable as Amin.  The only scene in this movie that gives a clue to Amin's personal eccentricities is at the end when he's quartered (removed the limbs from) one of his wives whom the Scottish physician slept with.  That's when the Scottish doctor finally decides all of the personal power and luxury cars can't keep him happy enough.  I am a fan of Forest Whitaker's, but this is far from his best work.  I would not recommend this movie for any reason.  
 The self-improvement books How to Win Friends and Influence People and Talking the Winner's Way are both way superior to this short book. Most of what you read is basically review if you've ready other similar books. And what's present doesn't pack enough substance or "how to" to make it really worth your time. About half-way through the book, Gabor started presenting fresh ideas. The problem, however, is that it was half-way through the book. Not a bad read, but there's so much better. If you happen across it one day on the street, it won't do any harm to read it. But I can't recommend paying money for something you already know, or can get for a better deal 
 Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds.   There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.  If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter.   There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.   Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.  Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.  Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters.  I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality."  Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters.  This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.  PROS:  Can be used for film or digital cameras  Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting   CONS:  Bulky and heavy Not neutral color balance 
 I find it hard to believe that the same band who put out the heavy metal classic "Burn My Eyes" and the strong follow-up "The More Things Change", would suddenly sink into the nu-metal trash. To be honest, most nu-metal that I actually like, I wouldn't buy a CD from(the nu-metal CDs I do have are from my nu-metal phase). The awesome riffs, the cool solos, the sweet drumming, and a band who had a message about society have been pushed aside here for power chords, rapping, and self loathing lyrics. I gave this 2 stars because I like 2 or 3 songs on here, but one of those 3 songs is a cover. When I saw the music video for "From this Day", it almost made me want to slap Rob in the face. He went from a tall, powerful metalhead to a stupid, trendy, spiky-haired w igger. They would get worse on "Supercharger", but thank god that Machine Head recovered on "Through the Ashes of the Empires". This is not a good place to start for Machine Head at all. Get their first 2 albums and their new one to hear Rob and the gang as a post thrash/groove metal powerhouse, not a nu-metal slump 
 I didn't enjoy this book, even though I'm partial to sea stories.  There is not a single likable, admirable character in the book.  I don't think the author, Robert Stone, has spent much time sailing or knows much about the sea.  I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in reading sea stories.  Actually the sailing material does not play a large part in the plot and is not convincingly portrayed.  So what then is it about?  It seems to be about the misery of modern American life.  Stone wants his novel to be deep and epic but it is just depressing and dorky.  The symbolism and ideas are mostly shallow.  There's obscure religious undertones that made no sense to me.  The parent/child relationships portrayed in the book are utterly banal and ugly.  I found no humanity at all in any of the relationships.   And consider the title-"Outerbridge Reach."  Outerbridge Reach is supposed to be an area in New York Harbor where derelict boats lie (get the symbolism?).  But I think the author wanted to title his story "Outta Reach" and came up with this 'clever' twist on the title instead.  Basically what the book is about is how fulfillment, love, and happiness are outta reach.  If you like this kind of depressing thing, you'll love this book.   I don't and I didn't.  Having said all this, I must admit that I did read the entire novel which I don't usually do if I dislike a book.  The reason I read on is that Stone writes well and has an elegant and interesting prose style.  He knows how to skilfully pace a story.  It's a shame that his talent is wasted on such negative content 
 This book is really a waste of time. Being an intelligent Christian, I loved Lee Strobel's book "The Case For Christ." I do not have blind faith, and in this spirit, I decided to see what Earl had to say about the book. It strengthened my faith in Jesus Christ by showing to just what lengths some people will go in their attempts to cast doubt on our Savior. He actually arrogantly taunted these incredible, well known scholars in this book that would intellectually tear him apart in person. I researched the author's credentials as well. They are not in the same league with those he "pretend" cross-examined in his book. The contents of the book and the manner in which the arguments are presented, reveal the author very well. I knew when I bought the book I would likely disagree with most of it, but I did not expect such an unprofessional approach. I read it from cover to cover, but this was painful at times with tangents that turned out irrelevant, in an attempt to make a counter argument.  I recommend that Earl read "The Case For A Creator," by Lee Strobel. IT TRULY DOES TAKE MORE FAITH to believe in naturalism, which he constantly referred to in "Challenging The Verdict" as a proof source for scientific backing for some of his theories. I would like to see him cross-examine some of the scientific experts in this book, who are recognized as some of the top scholars in their fields, and some who are former naturalists themselves. I am sure he would though (by book, but never in person) and I bet there are some people out there that are just nave enough to read it and listen to him.  Any author who tries to disprove our Creator, His written Word and our Savior Jesus Christ will always miss the boat on two things. 1) There is not an airtight case. If it were, then faith would not be required. It takes faith and study of the scriptures to reach a point where you are spiritually mature enough to really understand why. What I don't understand, I have faith that God will reveal in his own time and according to his own plan. 2) These scholarly attempts to disprove a Creator, or our risen, living Savior, sidetrack and cloud issues that in the end, just do not matter! What matters is JESUS! Once you have experienced Him, there is absolutely no argument sound enough to make a true Christian turn, because it is real 
 this book is as much about the gypsy communities as it is about confirming the author's own preconceived notion of  what eastern europe is (or what is not): in her own words, "certainly not a melting pot."  i will not comment on how the author deals with the main subject of her book, on the gypsy communities, its cultural heritage and its current problems- as a romanian, i am ashamed i know very little about it, and i was hoping to find out some answers by reading this book; i did not. there is one point where i agree on with the autor, when she deplores the absence of this subject from the public debate and modern scholarship.  let me now say what this book excels at: A. lack of scholarship.....: the author does a poor job identifying her sources. the 15 century of eastern europe as seen through the eyes of this author is full of surprises; to give just one example, "the princes of the teritories that would become romania made great fortunes of war, supplying food to constantinople". this is quite funny  given the intricate politics among the ottoman empire and the various genoese and venetian principalities that controlled the trade in the area at that time. what is more surprising is the almost random insertion of this statement in the context of the book.  B... to donwright plagiarism: one chapter of her book is entitled "temptation to exist" which is the famous title of a book by the romanian author emil cioran. name-dropping cannot replace bibliography (and this is unfortunately one of the more annoying habits of romanian scholars that the author seemed to have taken to).  C.... to insulting ignorance: is she aware of the sympathy of young cioran for the iron guard movement in the 30'? is paraphrasing a fascist sympathizer appropriate in a book about opressed minorities?   D... to cold war cliches: "to the people of the balkans, [the ursars... gypsies travellers with dancing bears] must have been a wonderful sight in the grueling last years of communism. for some reason, in ceausescu's romania people continue to pay money..." a bit assuming isnt it? well, what else were doing romanians during communism? gymnastics, nastase, sucking their own blood...perhaps, since even even the "literacy of the average romanian" is subject of mockery. E...to selective 20 century history: here again the evil spirit of eastern european chauvinism  is the obvious cause of all the evils of the century, if it weren't for other standard choices: nazy germany, etc... how about mussolini? there is not one mention   about mussolini and the fate of gypsies in italy...   For various reasons (perhaps some or many of them good) the author hates the country i am from. sometimes i do too. but i think a writer, an intellectual, should always be ready to engage in dialogue and thus set an example rather than labelling people (who did not benefit from the same schooling as the author did) as ignorant folk. on the contrary, this author does not permit even her (close?) romanian asisstant so much as a "tentative revelation" on the subject (these are the author's own words!!), not to mention that she misspelled her name (twice) in the acknowledgement.    Finally, i have a recommendation if you want to know more about gypsies and eastern europe check out emir kusturica's brilliant movies 
 I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.  
 I cannot say that I learned much about the Internet through this book.  The book was too simplistic for a regular Internet user.  The generalizations were repeated over and over throughout the chapters, which made the book fairly boring.  Also, the information in the chapters was commonsense based information.  If anyone has any knowledge about the Internet, this book is not for you.  Most high schoolers could probably give you the answers to the questions approached by Castells.  This book is not worth the price paid, I am sorry I ever bought it 
 Well, I researched the author and she isn't "world famous," or even well known, for that matter. The writing is contrived and the overall feeling is that Katie is a big overgrown teeanager, pardon the pun. While we bigger girls need to stick together, I felt the advice was a bit dated 
 Drew Rosenhaus may believe he is the top agent in the game, but his client list isn't very impressive in my opinion. Randall Hill? Marvin Jones? Eric Green? Sounds like an all-underachiever team. Although The Shark attempts  to potray himself as a suave playa who can talk street to his clients, he  comes across like a punk Vanilla Ice wannabe. Let's hope all agents aren't  trash like this 
 I think Bandit's Moon is a pretty good book. My Favorite part of the book is when O.O. Mary comes to town to kill Joaquin but the sheriff shot O.O. Mary's husband because he shot Joaquin in the shoulder and alomost killed him. I think you should read this very interesting book 
 I approached this title with all the expectations fostered by many friends endless promotions. I did my best to like it, to find some secret meaning, some redeeming quality within, to no avail. Actually finishing the book was an accomplishment, in my opinion. Ultimately I found the book aimless, soulless, and the promoter of everything negative about the human species. I know this sounds harsh, but time after time I felt let down by On the Road.  No, I don't "dig" it, Dean 
 Taut with international intrigue and frenetic action, Robert Ludlum's novels are generally highly entertaining and rich with suspense. The standard of The Cry of the Halidon, however, is well below his usual.   Unlike most of his other books, The Cry of the Halidon is rarely suspenseful and does not build to a recognizable climax. The plot is typical Ludlum fare, with Alexander Tarquin Mcauliff selected by a company, -Dunstone Limited- to head a survey team deep into the Jamaican forests. Minutes after successfully attaining the survey assignment, he is approached by British Intelligence and informed that the motives of Dunstone are far from honest.  Naturally, he finds himself involved not only with British Intelligence, Dunstone and the rebel factions of Jamaica but also with a third faction, an organization known only as the "Halidon." While initially this may seem gripping and interesting, the text quickly becomes confused and rambling. With so many hostile organizations and no primary antagonist, it is frequently difficult to comprehend the plot, let alone the actions of the main character.  Although the novel does become more interesting at its conclusion, I found The Cry of the Halidon to be ultimately unsatisfying, with its more suspenseful elements overwhelmed by a confusing plot, a sprawling diction and a lackluster climax. 
 It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition. I would not hesitate to use this vendor again.   
 This book is way out of date. The good thing about it is that we can read it and look back at how much things have changed since 1983 when it was published.  Another good thing about it is that we can look back and see how much things stay the same.  The same battles are happening today, but it does seem that, all in all, Cal's Moral Majority is more on the defensive now, whereas the so-called secular humanists seem to have gained ground in 20 years.

 Don't waste your money. What iRiver doesn't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead, the system is useless. I will never buy one of their products again and I'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iRiver products. My system cost me $340.00 and it is now as useless as the customer service department at iRive 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it pains me to say that is was terrible.  I am mystified why the author chose to call the book Charlotte because after JA's portion, Charlotte is rarely mentioned.  The rest of the story is a collection of rambling, tedious speeches by minor characters.  The story becomes ridiculous when the author introduces piracy and horse racing into Sandition.  It ends with the inevitable, but unbelievable uniting of Charlotte to Sidney.  It is unbelievable because they have barely had 2 or 3 superficial conversations in all of the author's addition to JA's fragment.  Don't waste your time on this one, check out Sandition instead 
 The wire broke off as I was slicing my first slice of chedder cheese.  Needless to say, I do NOT recommend this cheese slicer.  Last I checked, they're supposed to last longer than one slice.  Maybe mine was faulty...but regardless, I expect better 
 I bought this book soon after we adopted our daughter.  I found the writing style to be convoluted and precocious, much like the way children speak in contemporary movies (adult words from a child's mouth).  Sorry, not a fan.  We are still looking for a book that addresses an open, domestic adoption that can speak to children, not adults 
  I am really confused this book or booklet was like a bad version of a Guidepost. It wasn't all that witty and  the tales weren't that good. I bought this book figuring--It would charming and funny like the book "Marley and me".It was lame, dull, religious and preachy.I feel like I should charge Amazon a fee for wasting my time money and energies! What a RIP OFF! Below 1 star if that is viable 
 I bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted ones that we've seen in the mall, so this seem to be a good one.  Well, the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy. We had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in. Once we got it in, the head tripper felt great.  It really did send goosebumps down my spine.  THe only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off, litterally the next day after giving it to him. It first was bent and then finally broke all the way off. I do not recommend this product. I was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them. You can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short 
 These slippers are cute but the sole is VERY thin ergo, it's like walking on concrete. There is no arch support.  I would not buy them if either one of these things are an issue 
 This book defies description, it so bad. The dialogue is trite, the characters shallow, and the writing amateur. Sorry, Elrod, maybe you should go back to your day job. I'm ashamed I have bought all of Elrod's book on the advice of another author at Uncommon Con in Dallas/Fort Worth last year. I'm beginning to think she was in cahoots with Elrod to sell books for each other 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and "Into the Storm" is, by far, the worst.  There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other.  Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other.  Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s.  They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex.    The situations SB keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre.  All of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and I began skimming pages hoping that something, somewhere would grab my attention.  No such luck.  I used to love reading SB novels.  I couldn't wait for new books to be published and I'd stay up late into the night reading.  No more.  In fact, I think I'm done with Brockmann.  Granted, I never read SB for the suspense.  I loved the character development, the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story.  If I want suspense, which appears to be where SB would rather go these days, I'd much rather spend my time and money reading Tess Gerritsen or Karin Slaughter.  They do suspense so much better 
 The erotic content was on the level of jerking off into a test tube - never thought I'd find the sight of a woman masturbating so uninteresting 
 This is one of the worst horror movie I ever saw. I just hate it.    People dont waste your money renting or buying this crap.  If you want to see it that badly, just watch it on TV, like I did 
 I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric. After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read. At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut 
 I think Lynn Picknett sat down one night with a big bottle of wine and decided to rant her feelings, her research and strong opinions on some paper. She has some interesting ideas about who the Magdalene may have been or come from, and then never mentions it again- in fact here isn't much specifically about Magdalene at all.  And statements like "..when the Gnostics were silly they were extremely silly"- excuse me?? I resisted reading this book for a long time because friends who, like me, thought The Templar Revelation was an exellent book, didn't really like this one. Well, I gave it a shot, and it was not worth it 
 As a big fan of the Postal Service (their "Give Up" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)"Last Songs" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service 
 [the above is an actual quote from the book]  I don't usually read romances, but got this one at the library.  I thought: Thriller.  Hijacked plane, navy seal...all the right stuff.  And the beginning was promising.  Stan fixes everything, and has a human side to him that was compelling.  Then the plot hit the fan!  As a thriller it stunk.  The highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly, as an after thought.  The romantic "tension" between the protagonists was forced and irritating.  The dialogue is mundane.  The message that horniness leads to true romantic (Sam and Alyssa) love is rubbish.  The only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl, and I think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed.  The historic (WWII) componant was interesting.  But overall, I kept asking who the audience is for this book.  Not lovers of thrillers like me--and I wonder, do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane, or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether Teri will ever tell Sam that she loves him! 
 The gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un-fun!  The kids didn't even like it. Run, don't walk away from this dentist-office of a game JAWS-cr@p. (JAWS = Just another W. Smith 
 I am extremely disappointed in this book. After all the hype (the author proclaimed he was very successful, building 60 homes a year at his peak), this book appears to be written by someone who has never set foot on a building site.  It is virtually all written in generalities, with very little useful or valid information pertaining to contracting. This book really lacks SPECIFICS!! A lot of what the author does is just write "fluff," or "filler." In other words, much of his writing is just wasted space.  I believe that the positive reviews on this book were either written by morons, people who think "fluff" is good writing, or most probably, friends of the author who are trying to increase sales of his book.  It's really a shame, because I have the feeling that the author really does know about the building business. Too bad that he didn't choose to impart any specific knowledge to the people who forked over $25-30 for his book.  The author should be ashamed of this piece of work. It's really a ripoff. If you are a budding young contractor like me,   DO NOT waste your money on this book! Or, your valuable time.  
 This book has some merit, but does not add enough to the portrayal of Jesus in the gospels to make it deserving of more than two stars.  I liked Mailer's simple prose, which displays little of the show-offishness of The Fight, and the way in which he links the familiar events of the gospels, but otherwise I found the book slightly uninspirational. Jesus is portrayed as very human, and as grappling with the problem of how to handle his status of Son of God and the powers that go with it, but this is not a remarkable insight on the part of Mailer. I would think that anybody who has read the Bible with a sense of curiosity would have considered this as well 
 I bought this book based on its rating. Unfortunately, virtually every page of this book is half blank. Furthermore, there are many unnecessary blank lines within the text page. The format of this book is like for third grade. Also, the author uses Java code along with his text. But at the end of each chapter, he uses C++ code as a duplication of the Java code.    If you want to know and learn Design Patterns, make sure you look at "Software Architecture Design Patterns in Java" by Partha Kuchana. This book covers 42 design patterns including the 23 GoF patterns. Also, you might like to look at "Core J2EE Patterns" Second Edition by Alur, Crupi, amd Malks 
 I received my book a week before the class was over, luckily the local library was more reliable. Additionally they don't give refunds, maybe it's because they know there service sucks and would lose a lot of money......hmmmmm 
 I came upon this film while browsing my university library. My curiosity was picqued, since my home state is rarely discussed beyond such topics as drinking (Mardi Gras) and eating (Cajun food).  This film reminds me of a line from an explanatory plaque in Jean Lafitte National Park. Looking out over a marsh (through which runs a large gas pipeline), the panel details all the restoration efforts sponsored by ExxonMobil, Shell-Texaco, et al., all of whom have refineries in or around the wetlands. If they're cleaning anything, it's their own mess. And what methods are they using? "Bio-restorative detonations," I believe, was the term used. Are those "life-giving bombs"?  Back to the film, funded as propaganda by Standard Oil Co. when local sentiment was turning against the company. I'll pass over how many times the innocently befuddled Cajuns smile broadly at the blessed Oil Rig plopped in their marsh, and the way the young boy is given the Disney-nature-film treatment, as amusingly naive as Lobo the Wolf or Henry the Mountain Burro. No, just watch this film and catch a glimpse of the prosperity once promised to our humble state. And then visit the beautiful scenery of Norco, LA, in the middle of the famed Cancer Alley 
 Why am I reviewing this? I ordered it but was told it was not available 
 Upon my first use of this cute little flash drive, it broke. The yellow cover broke off and wouldn't go back on. I would not recommend it. I returned it. 
 Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that "Three Junes" was listed as a popular book choice.  The title sounded interesting so I bought it.  That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.  It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.  I will finish the book because that's my style.  It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to. 
 IMO, this is a terrible book for beginners.  The structure is non-linear; within the first few pages the author references more advanced Photoshop techniques as if the reader understands what he's referring to.  Frankly, I'm surprised the "for Dummies" group ever published the book.  If you're new to Photoshop, this book will almost certainly confuse & frustrate.   It simply is not a text that "Dummies" (read beginners) will get much out of.  I read the first 3 chapters, and I still had no understanding of Photoshop's basic features.   Perhaps it will be a good reference book as I become more adept at Photoshop, but I wanted a book that would teach me the basics.     I've found both the "Photoshop CS2 for Beginners" DVD and "Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book" to be far superior choices for Photoshop novices.  If I could rate this book a zero rather than a one, I would.      
 I used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades. I have always cut myself occasionally, but when I cut myself with the Fusion Power, I got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar! Talk about sharp! I went back to using it and then a month or so later I cut myself AGAIN and this one was even worse. You could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin. I tossed the Fusion in the garbage, went back to the 3-blade, and wrote Gillette an e-mail to complain, to which they did not respond.  I've read all 60 reviews before mine, and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem. Maybe it's my shaving technique, but this thing is a weapon 
 The musical is charming, but this recording of the musical is awful.  In fact, it is the worst recording of anything I have ever heard.  It sounds like one microphone was used to record the CD live on stage, so that the singers sound louder or softer depending on where they were standing on stage.  Not only does this lead to awful sounding duets, but even soloists sound at times like they are 100 feet from the microphone.  Avoid this recording like the plague 
 This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's a title to read if you wish to be considered "well read." Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird." 
 I think all this stuff is from California. I could be wrong. But it's pretty jewish, anyway. Ooh, I'm so kult/dangerous/initiated.   Anyone who drops money on this book, any like it, or anything remotely associated with Feral House and its pet charlatans, is a bloody fool. People who liked this also bought: Marilyn Manson's last album. Should tell you something about the level of culture here, no? Such folks want the allure of "badness" like rats want crack. No substance, pure ego trip. 
 Frank Chin uses 3rd person to go through the novel. What? Is he trying to question our competancy? It's and incredibly dull and boring book and is about a boy who dislikes being chinese. He wants to be a famous dancer-- so why doesn't he just do it. I mean it doesn't matter if you're chinese or not. Really, the book is about a kid who is so emo over his ethnicity, it just sickens me. Shut up and quit complaining. Only a few interesting dreams but that's it 
 Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.  I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English ("Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.     To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of "...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking..." or "...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking..." but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.  Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!    To reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I'll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive 
 I'm hoping that most of the people who wrote these reviews didn't actually stoop so low as to buy the book.  I read a few pages of it, and this is truly 7th-8th grade level writing.  I didn't realize that Bill's narcissism extended to the point at which he actually thought his writing was INTERESTING, rather than just blatantly one-sided and sickeningly arrogant.  Bill should stick to repetitive, "I know better," conservative babble - it gives us liberals/radicals/freethinkers something to make fun of 
 Unless you are interested in a running commentary on the lead character's peek-a-boo clothes, this is not the book for a serious reader.  If there is any science fiction in this book I failed to find it.  I will be sure to NOT read any other books by C J Ryan.  I can only assume the author is a frustrated stripper wantabe 
 I purchased this book, hoping it would examine the _ancient_ Egyptian source of the ideas within the Corpus Hermeticum. But, in that respect this book is entitled in a misleading manner. The author is a researcher for the Center for _Greek_ and _Roman_ Antiquity of the National _Hellenic_ Research Foundation in _Athens_. And, as the name of his foundation clearly implies, his academic zeal begins and ends with Greece and Rome.  Yes, everyone knows that the Corpus Hermeticum we now have was written by Greeks. But, my interest is in discovering the Kemetian source those Greeks worked from to come up with their Corpus Hermeticum. Alas, this book was no help.  
 It still amazes me that anyone takes Gould seriously. He is an admitted Marxist, and he allows his social beliefs to influence science. That is not science. Science is a dispasionate search for the truth. I get the feeling reading this book that Gould doesn't like what the truth is, so he wants to shape the way we see the truth. They used to do that in the middle ages when it started to look like the earth revolved around the sun.  Gould tries to claim that Samuel George Morton fudged his data on measuring skull sizes. This is not true. Morton conducted his tests with integrity, and only one error was found which actually benefited the measurements of a non-Caucasian group (Kevin McDonald, "Culture of Critique", 36). General intelligence is not a "statistical artifact" as Gould wants to promote.  Gould or any other scientist who wants to take Darwin out of biological sciences should be viewed with extreme skepticism 
 I thought I would love this book...and out of all the viking series I did like it.  But it was poorly written.   I have seen that Ms. Coulter does rewrite some of her novels this is definitely one of them that needs to be reproduced.  She had one to many loopholes that aggravate me as the reader.   I loved Miranda's character.  In my opinion out of all her characters I've read, I've only liked Alexandra Sherbrooke as my ideal woman next to Miranda.   What was disappointing there was not enough more combatative fighting between Miranda and those that kidnapped her nor just a visual between her brother and her.     Secondly with Miranda and Rorik...there was no romance.  I cannot figure how a man moves from detesting the woman to deciding to marry her...although there was a small explanation or round about, mainly Rorik's thoughts on how strong she is and capable.  But besides the romance...the sex scenes were horrid.   It seemed cold and clinical.  There was no passion.   Between Douglas and Alexandra, or even the Legacy/Brides/ and the rest of the Viking sagas..there was some kind of passion that gets you excited and into the hero.  But Rorik was horrid as a lover and poor Miranda just seemed unimpressed..until she decided to take things into her own hands...and then she had to be ill before that was sucessful.  So the quality of romance/passion was utterly lacking in this fic.  My main concerns would be to develop Miranda more and give her a bit more nuances, and expand on her fighting skills with a bit more action.    Another would be to definitely romanticise a bit of the sex scenes at least and give them a bit more loving relationship.  That is not only based on a marriage of convenience.     I think those two would change things a great deal and really improve the book 
 I really do congratulate Bill Rancic for being HIRED by one of the richest man in the world. But being hired does not mean that Bill Rancic just became the next Bill Gates or Warren Buffet.   Great to know that you take yourself VERY VERY highly Mr.Rancic. your going to fit fine in the Trump Organization, But seriously dont over do yourself.  I'd rather retake my 'X100 intro to business administration' class in my college than to buy this book 
 ... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.  To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another "blockbuster" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending 
 As someone that reads alot of books, both technical and non-technical, this is definetly the worst written book I've ever seen. It seems it has not been read by any editors. You can find typos, spelling mistakes, grammar errors and such all over the place. The authors just copy-pasted some of them over and over again. The text is boring to death, and for some reason, the least needed parts are repeated several times. For example, the meaning of "Description" of a field in a list is explained more than a dozen times in less that 5 pages. All of this, even before touching the content and subject of the book itself. The order of the content was not well thought of, the style of writing is boring, and the content itself is not very informative. As a developer, I did not expect to find much on the development side of SharePoint, but I doubt that even technicians and solution architects will find much help in this one 
 Full of beautiful pictures and containing much helpful information, one would think that this book is the perfect resource for home gardening enthusiasts and hydrangea lovers.  However, the most important information for gardeners without a degree in horticulture is the USDA Hardiness zone.  In my opinion, without this information, the book is useless.  I had high hopes that this book would contain it all; I was sorely disappointed.   Keep searching unless you just want to add one more hydrangea book to your collection 
 After hearing so much about this book, I was expecting something really informative but what I got instead was a book talking about America's federal debt for 300 pp.--BORING and NOTHING NEW.  As a financial professional, I can tell you that America has had debt for decades with no major consequences, and debt alone won't cause a problem for America.  There are so many other issues that are more problematic such as free trade and its devastating consequences, America's healthcare crisis, the real estate bubble, the pension problems, the global oil shortage, the elimination of the middle class, and the control of America and Washington by corporate America---issues that this book does not address.   After researching the authors, I now know why their coverage was so limited.   They are not financial experts, nor have they even worked on Wall Street.    In contrast, the book---America's Financial Apocalypse: How to Profit from the Next Great Depression---does address these issues in detail and makes Empire of Debt look like a comic book in comparison.   The debt chapter alone is better than the entire Empire of Debt book.  As well, the author does a spectacular job showing how the government and Wall Street twist statistics.  There are too many topics to mention but if you are looking for a book discussing ALL of America's challenges with hundreds of tables and figures to back up everything, look no further.  America's Financial Apocalypse is the book to read and was obviously written by one of America's foremost financial experts.  The price is well worth it.      
 Despite all the good reviews, this game is pathetic. Here are the reasons:  Horrible Stereotypes: If you're a Brujah character, you'll be like every other Brujah in existence. It's just that simple, if you want Celerity and Potence you play Brujah, if you want Presence you play Ventrue (those who've read the book understand the last sentence). The only good way to get a nice mix is to make a Clanless (Munchkin Alert!) or make up your own Clan (which Vamp players hate, because it forces them to think)  LARPs: I've chased LARP groups out of the graveyard near my house more than once. I hate them only because they don't respect the dead (or those that work during the day and SLEEP at night). You all don't have to LARP to play the game, I read the book. Sit around a table and eat pretzels like all other RPGers. Don't be afraid, it might develop your character and imagination to not run around at midnight and annoy all your neighbors and people who think you're in a dark section of the SCA.  Too expensive: For a book with no color whatsoever (and barely a system), it's as much as all the other RPGs on the market. Did I miss something? No color is stylish? That costs Extra?   Munchkin Factor 3: You'll have at least 3 munchkins in your group if you play with 4-6 characters. These munchkins usually have goth tendencies. No offense to goths, but y'all force normal people to hate you.   Game Mechanics are weak like a wet paper towel: the Soak die rules leave much to be desired, as two combatants could pound on eachother forever (I believe I had combat with 2 combatants last 3 hours once). The skills system is dumb, making a weak character able to do great things if he has enough of the skill.  Uncompatibility: All the WOD games CANNOT be played with one another. Mages are more powerful than Werewolves are more powerful than Vampires are more powerful than Hunters. Have fun you amalgamers!  We're Roleplayers!: The pompusness of Vamp players is quite annoying, since the system roleplays for them. Anyone could game Vampire. It's the same reason d20 has no respect with the game community elders (at least in my mind).  Finally, Suggestions: Don't play Vampire the Masquerade. If you really want a vampire game, upgrade to Vampire: the Requiem.  It's done much better than this tras 
 ....boring and Woody Allen will drive you insane. He never stops talking!!! 
 Having read info on this title my expectations were fairly high. My library not having a dedicated book on Augustine was lacking. It still is! This might be an OK purchase as a shelf companion to MANY other volumes on this topic. As a stand-alone I think not. Promises of books for further study in the bibliographies after each topic is largely a joke. Take 'predestination' for instance - not too many English titles here. Why? One suspects to hide the commercial 'scholarship' of the click, paste and rehash Eerdman editorial style of publishing. Take how Theisson's 'Lectures in Systematic Theology' revised by Doerksen as an example where Thiessen's work was adulterated to accommodate a broad theological market. For those familiar with Eerdmans editorial books (This claims to be an Encycleopedia !?!) the tradition continues. If you've got lots of Augustine books on your shelf, this book may help to tie up loose ends. However, a back cover reviewer correctly says about this book, 'the starting point for further research.' I agree as this sums up the depth of this book - pity about the bibliography though as mentioned above. (Yes, I admit I expect to see Latin references and the like.) If this is your first book on the topic, you may be better off considering other titles. For all what the book claims to be - a lightweight. Certainly I shall keep it as a reference, but I would not have purchased it given the opportunity to browse first 
 Playboy asks why this movie hasn't become a cult classic.  I'll tell you.    First of all, the painting on the cover does not look like the actual woman in the film.  One or two of the reviewers liked the way she looks.  Okay, to each his own, but don't be surprised if you find her unattractive.    Second, the nudity.  No, she is NOT nude all the time.  Nor half the time.  Nor a fourth of the time.  Nor...  She's nude a few seconds now and then.  No more than any other movie.    Third, the movie is only 79 minutes, and the first four of them are skippable.    The movie is mostly a man fighting with a Neanderthal survivor.  Both behave more childishly than primitively.  You'll see more convincing behavior in Clan of the Cave Bear.    There are NO explicit sex scenes.  Also, no effective sex scenes of any kind.  Even the fight scenes are disappointing.    Oh, and did I mention that the dialogue is a joke?    Bottom line: for almost every viewer, this movie will not be worth watching even once.   
 I'm a huge Don Cheadle fan, but this film is unworthy of him. [People] who claim that it's a story about racism either don't understand the film or don't understand racism. Basically, here's the plot: The character played by Mekhi Pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store. Rather than summon help for the others, all Pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register. He is caught, and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life. That is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film, because Pfeiffer's family insists on proving that he's no animal and can take his punishment -- in this case, death -- with his head held high. Yeah, right. Guess what? He is an animal, and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters, racism wouldn't be an issue. A more compelling question: if Pfeiffer's family was so concerned with his "dignity," why didn't they teach him moral values in the first place 
 I couldn't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking.  The characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do? Mamet appears to have never left Manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective.  To be honest I didn't finish the entire film, but instead checked the TV Guide for reruns of Northern Exposure for the real thing 
 This book attempts to call the reader to a compassion that Campolo feels is lacking in the 20th centurty church.  What it does is call Christians to a liberal legalism.  While there are a few issues he gets right, the vast  majority he does not.  For example he advocates for "celebate  homosexuals" to live together in a sort of plutonic harmony.   Campolo  doesn't seem to feel this would give occasion to sin (he does comdemn the  homosexual lifestyle -- yet not as much as say, a Christian owning a BMW).   Or if he does he simply ignores the issue altogether 
 This is a book about our society and yet I am left wondering how "everything bad for us" actually affects our society. I believe the author's underlying presumption is that improving the individual improves our society as a whole. This societal analysis, however, is completely missing.  The book can be summed up as follows: 1. Games and software are more complex, therefore our problem-solving ability has increased. 2. TV is more complex, therefore our emotional intelligence has increased. 3. The Internet gives us new ways to connect with others, therefore our communication abilities have increased.  The litmus test for all this is increasing IQ scores.  Part I of the book goes to great lengths to explain how an individual's "mental muscle" is increased through popular media: games, TV, software, and the Internet. Part II asserts that increased IQ scores are the proof that our mental muscle is increasing.  The individual may be benefiting from popular media, but is our society benefiting? Are more technological breakthroughs happening? Are we better able to piece together disparate facts provided by the media and government into a cohesive whole? Is software easier to use so we can more easily accomplish our goals? Are communities and homes being designed better so they improve communication between neighbors and families? Can we better recognize the underlying motives of our politicians? Are we making great strides to decrease global warming, air and water pollution, forest depletion, species extinction, famine, homelessness, cancer and disease, gender and racial inequality, and the distribution of wealth?  If our ability to see connections and solve problems has improved, why do a vast number of Americans still believe there is a connection between 911 and Iraq? Why do we not recognize that the diversity of plant and animal species on the planet directly affects our well-being? Why do we seem incapable of understanding that many of the divisive issues we focus upon (e.g., school prayer, flag burning, abortion, gay marriage) are simply manifestations of larger societal problems (e.g., inequality, poverty, domination and control).  How is the popular media affecting these societal and technological issues? Is it making them worse? This is the missing part of the book that I hope will be addressed in another edition 
 The book is detailed and the guy obviously knows what he is talking about but that is little help for someone who is trying to understand the concept's and practicality of what is being put forward. Save your money and buy "Visual Basic 6 Business Objects" by WROX 
 This is a very uncomfortable boot.  It puts a lot of stress and strain on the ankle.  I wear some type of boot almost everyday but could not wear these for even a few minuets.  My daughters could not wear them either.  They do look cute though.  We returned these boots 
 I bought this book because i enjoyed her book Creating a Beautiful Home. But this book was not a decorating book at all! It is not filled with ideas and inspiration. Rather, it is filled with a lot of  psychobabble nonsense 
 Back in the 70s, we hadn't yet learned to "just say no."  Perhaps that's why some people liked _Mystery Train._  Rampant drug use is the only possible reason anyone might find this gibberish interesting or enlightening.  It's so absurdly overwritten, so pompous, and so empty of actual meaning as to be beneath contempt.  This is, to books about music, what "Plan Nine From Outer Space" is to sci-fi movies 
 While there is no one good definition of "robot", I would state as a minimum requirement that it interacts with its environment.  Of the ten LEGO constructs in this book, only two - the Climber and Beetle - would qualify as robots.  Of the eight remaining ones, six have no sensor inputs at all, and four have only one motor.  These vehicles basically move forward or back, with no provision for turning, without major modifications.  That was the main disappointment: the book being more Technic than Mindstorms.  A much better title would be, "The LEGO Technic and Mindstorms Idea Book".  For many of these projects, a Technic battery pack could substitute for the RCX - and some of these look they were designed that way, with the RCX used to make them Mindstorms.  Plus, this book has little material about programming (except for an NQC programming language appendix).  Robotics is about both hardware and software, and that is the very spirit of LEGO Mindstorms.  There is also an overuse of obscure, exotic LEGO parts, such as the Slizer ones for the Legosaurus, and not all these projects can be built with the standard RIS kit.  The Legosaurus motor mounting will not work as shown (one 24 tooth gear on top of another needs 6 1/2 plate spacing).  I solved this problem by moving the motor to the rear end of the drive shaft.  I know this is an "Idea Book", and most of the fun comes with improvising, and improving the basic design.  From a purely non-robotic LEGO Technic point of view, most of these designs are great.  But if you want good Mindstorms books, try instead "Jin Sato's LEGO Mindstorms" or anything by Dave Baum 
  Since 'Gold' is nothing but an inferior rehash duplicate of 'The Very Best Of Marvin Gaye' CD set, I'll repeat most of my previous review here. While the music on this latest compilation is great, it's missing A VERY ESSENTIAL MARVIN CLASSIC....'After The Dance'!! This 2 CD set (nice packaging though!!) is a MAJOR FAILURE without 'After The Dance', and THERE IS enough room for it's inclusion (I remastered the set myself to include 'After The Dance' & more!!).   Also, instead of too many 'filler songs' from the so-so 'Here My Dear' CD, they could've (& should've!) included masterpieces like 'Save The Children', 'Flying High In The Friendly Sky', and Marvin's awesome 'Till Tomorrow' from his Midnight Love CD (1983). The rare track 'Where Are We Going ?' is nice, BUT by releasing this incomplete collection, Motown missed the boat AGAIN!   I advise everyone to remaster this set (with the proper software) & do Marvin some justice, since Motown continues to miss the mark!!! In the end, you'll have a CD set to REALLY be proud of!   GRADE for 'Gold' (a.k.a.'The Very Best Of Marvin Gaye')  Cover Art/Packaging...2 Stars!!  Tracklisting gets...1 Stars!!  OVERALL GRADE...1.5-2.0 STARS! 
 I AM STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE MY ITEM.  SO I COULDN'T POSSIBLY RATE SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE. EXCEPT TO SAY THAT ITS TAKEN WAY TOO LONG TO RECEIVE 
 Suzanne Somers' diet is a good idea and it works. However, based on her earlier successes, Ms. Somers' has started marketing a series of products to help follow her diet. This book is filled with recipes that all require her new products. Buy her old book where she still focused on using what is in your kitchen. These recipes are merely marketing for her products 
 This book has some good ideas, but the writing is highly slanted towards trying to convince you of the author's position and reads more like a lawyer trying to win a case in court than an expert offering the pros and cons of different strategies. Many of the numeric examples have highly optimistic assumptions for one side baked in, or give arbitrary negative assumptions to the other, just to try to convice you. I'd be warry of someone so cavalier with the facts when trying to get you to believe something. For example, the author doesn't want you to put your retirement savings in a 401k because you have to pay taxes on the money you withdraw. However, those taxes are completely offset by the taxes you save when you deposit into it, making it equivalent to an after tax investment without capital gains. Why is the author so biased in favor of universal life insurance instead 
 This book was good but not terrific. after reading best sellers like Why we want you to be rich by Donald TRump and God Doesn't run a $2 Shop by Sage Saint Francis i found that this book just was not in the same leauge. i mean those two books changed my life, and actually got me the result and financial freedom i was after but they are not for everyone. I do not feel this is the authors best work, however i still believe it is a good investment and a descent place to start 
 I was forced to read this book in my Junior Health class in High school. The book is interesting enough and easy to read. Any reading level can understand this book.   The plot revolves around Nick Andreas, who has received a restraining order against his ex-girlfriend Caitlin after hitting her. The story shifts between present day Nick dealing with his anger management class and filling out a journal. Those journal entries provide inside into the past, highlighting Nick and Caitlin's relationship while it was still "happy".   It was a constant reminder throughout the whole book that the author who wrote this book has no idea how teenagers actually speak. Being one myself, I have firsthand experience. It's not as if the characters use words that no normal one would use, it's just the manner in which they present themselves. Frankly, most of the dialog is just uninteresting and unrealistic.  My other complaint are Nick's journals. He writes them so perfectly detailed that it seems like they are happening in present day. He even uses quotes and "she/he said" to cap them off. I find it extremely hard to believe that any teenager will be that in-depth with a journal entry, treating it as if they were writing a novel.  I commend the book for dealing with such tough issues as control problems and child abuse but any brave steps taken to deal with these or short cut with the ridiculously formulaic ending that made the whole book feel like a worn-out after-school special.   Overall, the book is not the worst in the world but it definitely could have been better. I could have written a book better than this in my sleep 
 What the hell are fabulous actors Christian Slater, Julianne Moore, Steve Bucemi, Debbie Harry and Matthew Lawrence doing in this piece of trash? Even Are You Afraid of the Dark? is creepier and more captivating than this stinker. This is a collection of lacluster stories that are a waste of time 
 Save your money, don't throw ir away on this piece of trash. Kenny is a undertalented, overrated bald-headed little guy that got lucky. He cashed in on this island theme and thinks he is the Jimmy Buffet of country music when all he really is a artist with no talent. 
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 not nearly as appealing as the other magazines I have read: motortrend, car and driver, automobile mag, sport compact.  I don't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars.  Car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny 
 This will only please the most ardent vampire fans.  Why?  It's exceedinly poorly written.  I figured when I watched it it would either be a decent movie or so bad that it wouldn't matter.  Sadly it was neither.  Don't get me wrong, it was bad, but in all of the wrong ways.  For example the writing, plot dialog, character development is basically not there...well they are they're just about as interesting as chalk.  Unfortunately the acting's not bad.  This results in what must be the worst kind of bad movie.  You can't laugh at the bad dialog because it isn't bad enough, it's just flat.  And you can't laugh at the poor acting because for the most part it's acceptable.  It's got gore and blood, but it isn't the least bit scary.  In general my accessment is it is bad in the most painfully mediocre and forgetable way.  if you want sexy evil wait for the remake of Amityville Horror to be released.  Ryan Reynolds may not play a vampire, but that movie had more development in it's credits than this had in it's entirety 
 There is an old saying, if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all. But I feel compelled to critique this film, partly because I really liked what I think it was trying to say... Follow your heart, not what's necessarily popular, follow a Bohemian lifestyle if that what makes you happy. O.K.  This film instead comes across as one produced by a major corporation to get us all thinking about heading back home to the suburbs. Because really what it's saying is even if you have all the idealism in the world, it will only land you in a ghost of a town like Woodstock, N.Y., full of self doubt, and hypocritical trappings.  First of all the acting was not bad, I have no issues with the acting. In fact along with the other fine actors in this film, Colin Farrell should be angry. Their true abilities in developing characterization seem to be written, directed, and edited right out of this film. There is little or no subjective viewpoint from these characters lives. The viewer is left on the outside looking in, wondering where these characters are coming from, or what they are motivated by. This film forces us to assume everything in order to believe anything, without dramatizing or exemplifying why these characters feel the way they do. The effect is clear, as the screen-writer and director have apparently anesthetized these characters into poseurs and masked sterotypes; the only thing left to be certain, the only thing that can be derived, is that they truly do believe in hair color, haircuts, and one-night stands.  "A home at the end of the world," wants us to believe it's making a liberal statement, wants us to swallow the whole enchilida. By using home as a metaphor and a terminal disease to create sympathy for itself, what this film really does is lead us down the road with good intentions to a home decorated in bad taste. 
 Promises made & never kept, this book is about a marriage of the soul w/yourself.  Nothing really to do w/finding a lover, a mate or a friend. It's all about the relationship you are having w/your soul before you can possibly go & find a mate. Very heavy reading. I felt like I wasted time 
 I was at Scullers when they recorded the live parts of this album.  There were lots of great moments in that concert...unfortunately, none of them made it onto the album.  It's like they took only the dull parts of the  concert.  The studio portions aren't much better. I'm a huge fan of Danilo  Perez and John Patittucci but this album is really boring 
 Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other, the end. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine, hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe 
 Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam, guilty pleasure of the middle 80's scene, she was the queen of Freestyle by that time, her music was around every club, and her style will remain in many people minds.  Her sounds were extremely danceable, although some people thought that her voice was a little bit squirky and anoying, it fitted just great to the type of music she wanted to approach, even her hit ballad "All Cried Out" a bittersweet melody with amazing lyrics, that will be covered later by many, fitted her just great, but undoubtly her greatest achievment was dance music, "Head To Toe", "Lost In Emotion", where #1's the same year and make everybody love this, sadly she became lost in more pop oriented tunes with the next albums, saving only "Let The Beat Hit Em" that it's truly a comeback to the dance music scene, but too late, the magic was lost and we should point to "Little Jackie Wants To Be A Star" as guilty for throwing Lisa's career to oblivion, but if you forget that and concentrate on the early materials you will find an artist that surface out of the bunch, because they were talented and had a new flavor to offer to the public 
 This book took me three months to read. It was so dry and boring it put me to sleep. The book contains no charts, no photos, nothing but text. It was part of an assignment for a college lesson. I'm embrassed  to admit I chose  this book because it was thin, yet the subject was over the topic I wanted.  After I read it, I didn't find the deepth it promised. Its view was off in  left field. If I was going to point out any one thing I learned for this  book I'd say, size doesn't always make a book easy." 
 	And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.  	The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations. 	This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.  	The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.  	All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away. 
 this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho 
 The most memorable part of this film was the dance scene to "Night Life" which would repeat through the movie.  This version credits the song, but it was replaced with some lame disco music. I am writing MGM to complain and demand a refund.  Even the trailer has the right music playing all through it.  Demand the original 
 In a visual perspective, it's provocative, shocking, and highly disturbing to the point of it being too overwhelming for words...but overall, the movie creeped me out 
 I like the old recipe better, but this should give some people who were intolerant to the limitations of the old recipe a choice.  It is okay. Cheap book worth buying for what it is.  
 This book went great until page 18, when it switched into high-gear, Christian bible-thumping mode.  It goes as far as to say "...it's only when we go after those ideals from the foundation of Christian faith that our efforts will yield anything worth holding on to."  I have no problem with books geared towards Christians.  I DO, however, have a problem with devious marketing.  There are no idicators anywhere on the cover that this is anything but a guide to choosing a career.  Instead, it is just another tool designed to shove Christianity down unsuspecting throats.   
 I haven't read any of the real Robert Ludlum before, but I don't think I will be starting if this is his style. The action scenes, with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts, are perhaps better suited to a 90 minute movie instead of a 400 page book. The weapons-catalogue padding is comical at first, later frustrating. The childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places. We know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest. Perhaps most disturbing is the book's overall 1950's style racism  in which the Americans are dashing, multi-skilled warriors for good and the Russians, Ukrainians, even Germans are all ugly, inhuman or quickly dead. Whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water-tight, the reader is always a step-ahead of the characters. As other reviews have said, suspense and mystery are left absent 
 I had high hopes because I love reading about books, but this one was disappointing. I originally gave it three stars for the photos, which are worth looking at, but the text it pretty awful -- a serious drawback in a book aimed at compulsive book collectors. I took off one whole star specifically for a line that says something like, "It doesn't matter if books access is difficult, as long as it isn't completely impossible." Doesn't matter to whom? It does to this reader. I reread. I browse nostalgic favorites. I like to handle my books, and I need to be able to get to them. Also, a substantial number of the storage systems shown appear to be concerned more with style than with storage -- I didn't mind the coffee table constructed of books layered with glass, as those were old design catalogs and the whole was sort of a pun, but the grid system and a few other types of shelves that only contained a book or two here and there as placed by a decorator is really not my idea of living with books. Get this if you want pretty pictures. If you're really interested in books themselves and how they are stored, try Henry Petroski's The Book and the Bookshelf instead 
 Before I say all the reasons I don't like this book, I'd like to point out that I'm sure its elements are appealing to some readers.  We all like different things; I didn't like this one.  I did finish it, but only because I have this thing about always finishing whatever I read.  Lindsey relies on dialogue and action for this novel.  Did I say action?  Dear god, what with the beatings and kidnappings and running around, you get the sense that she's covering the complete lack of character development.  The hero and heroine had all the usual qualities that romance heroes and heroines do, but they were just incredibly flat and cliched, as if their qualities had been randomly selected from a romance chart or phrase book and then inserted.  I cared nothing for either of them, and found the hero to be weak and uninspiring.  It was never clear why the characters liked each other; Lindsey never got into their heads.  A weak attempt at the romantic historical.  
 I was very excited about this book before I started to read it.  Polk appeared to have flawless credentials...surely someone with so much relevent experience would produce an outstanding book on Iraq.  Unfortunately it became clear very early on in this book that my expectations were not to be met.  Let's start witht the obvious.  The subtitle of this book begins as "the whole sweep of Iraqi history..."  The book is 213 pages and even that can be deceiving...physically, the book is very small and the typesetting appears larger than average.  To be sure, no single book could adequately present the whole sweep of Iraqi history, but of all the Iraqi history books I have read or referenced, this book does the poorest job of all in terms of presenting an overview of the country.  I would recommend Anderson and Stansfield's book as an example of one of the best books in this area.  The way Polk has the book organized, it would be reasonable to have high hopes.  There are six chapters: Ancient Iraq, Islamic Iraq, British Iraq, Revolutionary Iraq, American Iraq, and Whose Iraq?  He appears to have the important bases covered, but within these chapters lies a remarkably weak and half-hearted presentation of Iraq's history, at least at the governmental level.  Another somewhat related criticism would be that there are next to no cited sources in the entire book.  From an academic standpoint, this is baffling.  His experience in the field notwithstanding, it is unacceptable to produce what is to be a serious history book and then provide no sources or bibliography.  The key here is to recognize that at its heart, this book is not an attepmt to provide a history of Iraq, but merely an outlet for criticizing the way the U.S. (particularly Bush) has handled Iraq.  Onto that criticism:  Polk is one of those authors that rightly and (mostly) accurately points out all of the bad things the U.S. has done when it comes to Iraq.  From a moral or humanitarian perspective, of course it's wrong to give support to someone like Hussein.  I think most people would agree with that.  What baffles me is that someone could so passionately point out all these bad things and then be so opposed to a war that ultimately removed a regime who surived up to that point because of what the U.S. had done.  Even though it was not the reason given, the U.S. had accumulated quite a large moral debt to Iraq.  In short, we owed it to Iraqis to get rid of Saddam.  Further explanations of this type of thinking can be found in Feldman's "What we owe Iraq," and Cushman's "A Matter of Principle."  My last main complaint about this book is that for all the criticizing and lamenting about U.S. intentions and mistakes (and believe me, these are all warranted), Polk offers no real ideas for what to do to help Iraqis build a better future, and more importantly, he never even touches on the topic of what kind of life these people would have endured if Hussein was still in power today.  I think it's important and necessary to call the U.S. on its mistakes, but at the end of the day, the U.S. actually helped get rid of a dictator this time.  And even though we owe this to a lot of other countries, I can only be glad that humanitarian and security interests were aligned in this case, and that for all the other problems, there is at least a chance for democracy and a better life in Iraq.  That chance certainly did not exist under Hussein.  The biggest let down here is that it is important for people to understand Iraq, but this book I believe, is doing more harm than good.  If you've done a fair amount of reading on Iraq, this will be clear so that's not the danger here.  What would be an absolute tragedy here would be for someone with no prior experience to pick up this book and then think they have a real understanding of Iraq after reading it.  These are the types of books that make my job as a professor harder than it should be because I have to spend so much time in order to defuse all numbers of students who read material like this and base their opinions and judgements from it.  While not nearly as damaging to the process of education and understanding as Michael Moore or Sean Hannity, it is much more disappointing because Polk has the education and experience needed to produce stellar work.  Framed in those terms, this book is largely a failure 
 Julia Glass buried her finely designed characters in excessive, useless words.  A discard.  Not National Book Award Material 
 I watched this movie on BRAVO one time, and they were plugging it as a comedy. Unless you have a screwed up sense of humor, this moive is far from that. It's very tragic, but then again, perhaps I'm just over-sensitive and gullable. I feel that I was mislead and I hate this film and will never watch it again. 
 When I read this book several years ago, I did not understand how anyone could have believed it. Having known several true Holocaust survivors, and heard their stories, I certainly didn't.  Now, there have now been several clear and thorough exposes of the fraud perpetrated by Bruno Grosjean Dossekker, who falsely claimed here to be one Binjamin Wilkomirski, a child survivor of the Holocaust. Stefan Maechler, The New Yorker, 60 Minutes and several other publications prove beyond any doubt that Wilkomirski is no such person and that Fragments is a fiction.  Every possible lead has now been followed; each detail in Dossekker's narration of "events" has been compared with historical records from such leading Holocaust scholars as Raul Hilberg and Lawrence Langer, accounts of other child survivors, interviews with members of the Dossekker and Grosjean families and more.  The strongest evidence, unearthed by Stephan Maechler, is the fact that in 1981, Dossekker/Wilkomirski contested the will of Yvonne Grosjean, whom, in a letter to officials in Bern Switzerland, he called "my birth mother." Dossekker/Wilkomirski received a third of her estate.  Other evidence includes Dossekker/Wilkomirski's use of Laura Grabowski to "corroborate" his story. Grabowski claims to have known him in a children's home in Krakow. In fact, Grabowski is an American citizen of Christian faith who has since her youth fabricated stories about her victimhood, the most well-publicized being a book called Satan's Underground.  The Social Security number of said Lauren Stratford is the same as that of Grabowski, who subsequently used it to make a false survivor's claim. Furthermore, Satan's Underground and this volume contain startling similarities.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 It takes a lot of skill to tell about how a FICTION book is historically inaccurate. In Richard Abanes next book he is going to tell why the elves in The Lord of the Rings could not have exciste 
 I should have known not to read a book about First Time Moms written by a man - psychologist or not. He has a very strong viewpoint on moms not working Full Time outside of the home. If you are a mom who chooses to do so, reading this book(and that chapter in particular) may cause you to feel like you aren't making enough 'sacrifices' as he puts it, for your child.  He is very anti-daycare and seems to lump all daycares into one group. I really, really disliked this book. Save yourself the time and read the Girlfriend's Guide instead of this man's old fashioned viewpoints that just don't work with today's families. Being a good parent is more than being home during the day to "make lunches for your child" or 'bandage their knee" in my opinion.. 
 This book was not in the same league of Frazier's first effort.  I found myself not caring about the characters and basically wanting the book to end.  The lack of a plot would be fine if you could get caught up in the character or lost in the beauty of the language but the writing is so overblown and tedious the fact that nothing much is happening stands out.  I really wanted to like this book and I was trying hard to like it as I read it but the fact of the matter is, this is a bad book 
 Very bizzare movie! Not for kids or anyone who is prudish! Can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it 
 This book postulates a relationship between creativity and autism. This is a potentially interesting idea. There have been suggestions and some evidence that creativity is linked to tendencies to a variety of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia (see the work of Gordon Claridge) and bipolar disorder (see the work of Kay Jamison). The hypothesis that it might also be related to autistic tendencies is certainly worth examining.  However, this book has several serious flaws that ruin it. The first is that it seems to ignore the notion of a personality spectrum, which is central to most theories of a relationship between creativity and psychiatric or neurological abnormality. Those who suggest a relationship between creativity and schizophrenia, for example, do not suggest that most creative people actually have schizophrenia, but that there is a continuous spectrum of liability to schizophrenia and that highly creative people tend to be further than most people along this spectrum. It is quite possible, and at least worth testing, that they also tend to be further than most people along the spectrum of liability to autism. However, Fitzgerald is not suggesting this. He is suggesting that many creative people actually had autism or Asperger syndrome as a definite diagnostic category. While it's possible that some did, extending the diagnosis to so many people is very questionable, unless one is to make the definition of 'autism' far more elastic than it usually is. If any eccentricity or social awkwardness is to be classed as 'autism' - as it sometimes seems to be here - then 'autism' begins to lose its meaning.  Secondly, just as the definition of autism is fudged, so is the definition of creativity. While it is probably impossible to get a definition that everyone will agree on, this book seems at times to equate it with eminence: a serious problem. For example, it is questionable whether even strong political supporters of Sir Keith Joseph would have described him as exceptionally creative in any of the usual senses.  Thirdly, the author ignores the difficulty of diagnosing people whom he has never met, and about whom the evidence is often imperfect. He selects biographical items that fit his theory, and ignores other aspects of the situation. For example, his discussion of the mathematician Ramanujan totally ignores the cultural differences that could have made this Indian mathematician behave unusually in the context of Cambridge University norms of the 1930s.   Fourthly, and most seriously, the author's zeal for a diagnostic category often lead him simply to try to portray his chosen characters in as pathological a light as possible: sometimes with very little relation to the characteristics of Asperger syndrome. This results in a very gossippy, 'tabloid science' style, which has quite negative implications both for the subjects of his biography, and indeed for people with Asperger syndrome. The references to Hitler are particularly offensive in this context. Hitler, who was able to mesmerize and manipulate others with frightening effectiveness, would appear to be at quite the opposite end of the spectrum from what is usually diagnosed as autism/ Asperger syndrome. These references, and the generally negative tone of the biographies, run contrary to what may have been the author's aim to portray the positive side of autism and eccentricity. 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 As a careful student of scripture who uses scripture to explain scripture, I was severely disappointed by this book. A single example will serve to show why everyone should avoid this work.  The Seals, Trumpets, and Bowls take up 11 of the 22 chapters of the book of Revelation. They are saturated with Old Testament quotations and allusions. Yet LaHaye doesn't use a single Old Testament passage to help him explain these three series. This is completely inexcusable. But even more, when he considers the first horseman (the first Seal), he completely ignores Revelation's own use of the symbolism of "white robes" and the "crown" (Greek: stephanos, the crown given to the righteous). By doing this, he turns the meaning of this symbol completely on its head.  No one should read this book for anything other than a good example of how not to read the Bible 
 The author of this book teaches the reader to talk down to their sub-conscious and treat it with disrespect. His advice tells the reader to treat the subconcious as a child.  A healthy individual makes friends with his/her subconcious. They become partners. They do not "beat up" their subconcious like the author teaches. Treating your subconcious with such disrespect as this book recommends is harmful . How can you love yourself if you disrespect a large part of yourself (the subconcious)?  
 The coverage on Loss due to external factors is fair but not deep enough. So only suitable as a first reading for someone who is new to retailing. The coverage about Internal theft is far from satisfactory ! 
 The other reviews were right on target.  I'll add: little substance, spelling/proofreading errors, unfocused photos, and very little useful information.  I'm not impressed and I'm getting my money back.  The only marginally useful part was the list of brand-name products and tools at the end.  For a momma committed to my daughter's natural hair health, this book has way too much about chemical treatments.  My most used references: It's All Good Hair (Michele N.K. Collision) and Kinki Kreations (Jena Renee Williams).  This just isn't worth the shelf space on my bookshelves 
 This book says the big problem with the Dems is they have no ideas.  OK so far.  They point out how the Repubs have put together a vast machine, involving think tanks, training centers, a right wing media, and coordinated messaging.  Yup, that's true.  They point out that the Dems not only have no ideas, but they run their campaigns in fundamentally wrong ways, such as going to the same few consultants, concentrating on a few states and a few races and not running nationally...dead right.  But...in more than 200 pages, I can't find a single idea.  Not one.  They keep saying that there's hope, that the Democrats can work this out, can become the majority party again.  But they don't give a single clue as to the ideas that would lead us there.  Don't buy this book.  Buy Joe Klein's book.  Better read, and what is good in this one is pretty much in that one 
 I was very excited that one of My "boys" had bought Me this chair, but when it finally arrived, I was very disppointed. the motors are semi weak, it does NOT feel like 10 motors more like 6 if that. the chair's pic is also very unrealistic in My opinion, the seating it not attached, its a pad, very cheaply made not worth the price at all... I wouldnt pay more then 80.00 for this chair! 
 I'm dissapointed at the arguments brougt forward by the philosopher in favor for the death penalty, Pojman. Even if you ignore the content of his arguments, the logic on which the argument was built didn't hold much  water. Even though I'm myself against the dead penalty, I have seen others  make a better and more coherent case for it. Pojmans last argument, that  people that are against the dead penalty and pro choice are somehow  immoral, is gratuitous and has nothing to do with an argument for the dead  penalty. I would have expected a more thourough and convincing case 
 Smith's book is a classic, and it is cheap - so those are some benefits.  However, the book is poorly organized.  It does not give you a clear outline in each chapter, and instead bounces around a little too much.  The most frustrating part of the book is Smith's clear intention to make all the religions seem as similar as possible.  Therefore, I think he sometimes does not give a clear picture, but instead describes the lowest common denominator.    Finally, some knowledge of Christianity will be helpful in reading this book.  He uses allusions from the Bible in every chapter.  
 Probably excellent for a child but no good for an adult beginner.  My mistake 
 Junk, It will not fly, tried for over 2hrs. It kept crashing into the ground. We called the company, they said it does that. Do yourself a favor and save a headache, do not buy this!!!!!!!!!! 
 I had hoped to use this book in my high-school history class but found that it does little in terms of imparting a solid sense of what life was like in ancient Rome.  The mystery portion is okay, but my real disappointment stems from the weakness of the historical contextualization 
 this is the cut down version of the 3 hour pilot that universel released in theaters after the show went belly up in '78. if you buy the whole series you can skip this pointless rehash that isn't that good or very well thought out 
 I read parts of this "book" until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and I immediately returned it to the library. What a stultifying simpleton this man is. He is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas. And unsurprisngly, this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the "David Letterman Show" and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity. First, he claimed that no one should criticize President Bush "because we're at war and it's no good for the country." Come again? I say that such a statement is "no good" for democracy, which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about. The right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the First Amendment. And this man is a graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government? Also, he insisted that Cindy Sheehan, whose son was killed in Iraq, not have the right to be publicly upset with President Bush and the invasion of Iraq because "she's connected with left-wing elements in this country." What left-wing elements? I feel that Cindy Sheehan is as connected to left-wing elements as much as Bill O'Reilly is associated with logical reasoning. 
 Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar. I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card.  But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem. Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader.  
 The card player is one of Dario Argento's most recent film and it doesn't seem like the usual Dario film, its not a giallo film but more like a competent Euro-thriller it even has that cheesy techno music that constantly gets played in the background which gets annoying after a while. The film was very dissapointing but I wouldn't say that it was awful there were some interesting scenes like the killer using the game of on-line poker with the police in return for the lives of his kidnapped prey and the chase scene with Remo the proffesional poker player, the only problem is that the film just turns into a routine detective story that gets kind of dull, if this film was done by another director than maybe I would have liked it better but since it was done by Dario I expected a much better high quality thriller that wasn't so predictable. You won't find any gory death scenes or excellent camera techniques but it is more modern contemporary and you can tell from the look of this film although some of the shots of Rome were very nice. Its worth checking out once but not worth buying unless your a diehard Dario Argento fan like myself lol 
 This book was not at all what I expected.  I was looking for fast and healthy meals to put in front of my family every night; and with the title being "...For People Who Don't Have Time To Cook", I assumed it was geared towards busy families.  Unfortunately, the majority of the recipes are not kid-friendly.  Dishes like Cider-Poached Salmon with Spiced Pear Sauce, Grilled Swordfish on Herbed Couscous with Vegetable Minestrone, and Middle Eastern Lamb Stew are not likely to please my brood.  I sent this book back.  2 stars because the presentation of the book is nice, and I'm sure someone looking for fancy dishes like these would enjoy it 
 I bought this book as a quick reference for a Technical Support group I manage.  We have a few dozen products that require an installer to run wires throughout a house. Unfortunately, a large majority of the calls I get are wiring related and this book provides tremendous insight into the problems created by improper wiring.  If you want to learn about wiring, this is the book to buy.  I also bought the full book that goes with it.  It must be good because I got the only paperback, and all the used hardback books are almost double the retail price.   From this guide you'll learn everything relating to wiring.  You'll learn balanced vs unbalanced, ground loop isolation vs cross talk, and the list would almost be half as long as the pocket guide.  Simply put, if your livlihood depends upon wiring, this book will help you a great deal.  
 I'm an undergrad from a NON-Ivy League school who works in the sex industry, and I was shocked at the stupid decisions she made!  Doing coke with customers, smoking crack, telling a male friend about her work and was shocked he tried to buy a service, unprotected oral, kissing all of her clients on the mouth, working for a pimp...  It just goes to show a degree doesn't help in this business unless you plan on writing a self absorbed memoir.  Her writing is so-so as well.  A lot of it goes like this, "I did this... and then I did that."  You get the feeling that she thinks she's very elegant and sharp, but really, she was only charged $200 and hour.  For a classic book on sex work, read Xaviera Hollander's "The Happy Hooker."  It's a little dated, but she actually has an interesting story to tell.  
 I loved the Sunday Wife.  The book had a great concept however we were lead into little clues along the way of different relationships and twists and turns...and yet nothing went further.  The focus ended up on the one SSG who got cancer and died.  The end left me very empty 
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 I found this story very average. Just so-so, not a page-turner. The writing is average, the story is average. I was surprised that the author didn't seem to know about point of view. He kept hopping heads in the same scene--very amateurish. I advise you not to waste your money. If you want to read it, go to the library 
 When I got my Fagor pressure cooker I thought it was going to be a long relationship. But I have learned over the past few months that it's much more trouble than it's worth.  It may cut cooking time in half, but it certainly doubles clean-up time.  It's hard to regulate the cooking of the food that's locked inside the cooker.  In a regular cooking pot I can look inside and see how things are going, add things at the right time, make any adjustments that I need.  I like the ease of just bringing a regular pot to a boil, reducing to simmer, and coming back when the timer goes off. I hate trying to get the pressure right, worrying that it's too much pressure, and then waiting for it to depressurize or depressurizing it manually to speed things up.  Food textures are often all wrong. And when is it done? You can't just open it up, look inside and say "ten more minutes".  For the same price you can get some very nice copper-bottom pans that will last your whole lifetime and have no gaskets or valves that will need replacing 
 Once is forgivable, but second one? I know money is really tempting, but you are losing my respect here.... 
 Old songs from a young J.L.Hooker. I never listen to this CD. Glad I bought it on sale. The CD has some decent guitar, but I don't like the chosen songs.  Not a favorite of mine 
 Alain Daniélou's assessment of the dionysiac cults is somewhat naive. The Dionysaic cults are by no means just about free, ecstatic love and religious tolerance. As René Girard has shown, these cults are most of all about the sacrifice of an - innocent - scapecoat in order to regularly release the tensions which again and again build up in a society. Pagan societies, which do not know forgiveness, need this form of tension release in order to preserve or reinstate their unity. The origin of the dionysiac cult is the cruel and indeed ecstatic murder and paradox divinisation of the founder of a culture/society. In Indian mythology, for instance, Parusha was torn to pieces and out of the pieces came the four castes. This founding murder is again and again repeated in the dionysiac cult. Archaic forms of this cult used to sacrifice humans, later forms animals. The Holocaust is a modern form of dionysiac ecstasy. Daniélou of course does see very clearly that dionysiac ecstasy is tension release. What he does not see or know is that mere tension release is not all that is possible in lovemaking 
 This is the only book I returned to Amazon.com. Not because it is poorly written or inappropriate sexual content; it is a well written history of courting evolution. But, this book is also a plodding tome, more a textbook  than a book to focus family discussions as advertised. The USA Today review  explained, "a wonderful anthology.... It teaches a higher form of sex  education--a form that cultivates awe for the depth and breadth of marital  love while showing respect for the fragility of the human heart."  Mostly the book will put you and your teens into a deep sleep. If you love  good books, great books, buy it. If you are looking for a book to help with  discussions with teenagers this is not it 
 Let's keep in mind that Hall wrote back in the 1930s and 1940s, when there was far less in print on esoterica than today.  Still, Hall's book on gnosticism is overly complicated and terribly pedantic.  One has the sense, too, that Hall is regurgitating received ideas.  There is no hint of real scholarship, or of an individual approach to the material.  I'm biased, however, by the fact that Hall fancied himself as a master of all esoterica, given the breadth of his writings.  If I knew as much about anything as Hall knows about everything . . . Add to this Hall's fervent championing of freemasonry as a repository of real wisdom, and one has to wonder who Hall was, and where he got the ego to appoint himself as an authority on sacred teachings.  There are far better books on gnosticism.  
 I bought this DVD because it features Alan Rickman. I also purchased it because of someone else's Amazon review (They sounded like they really knew what they were talking about). I am glad I bought it used, because if it were new, I would feel that I'd been cheated.  The movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor's office. There was no sense of suspense, and I was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea (Mind you, I'm NOT the type who requires non-stop action and special effects to be happy).  The dialogue throughout was tedious and trite; the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line, as well as the director and the editor.  The plot was, in some respects, totally illogical, and at other times nonsensical. Even previous scenes don't tie in neatly enough at the end. The plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible. The choices the characters make - whether restless, bored, frustrated - don't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film (Like a greedy, unwashed vampire).  The movie features a wealthy, bored couple. I was also bored. But I'm not wealthy.  However! All the actors did their best within the limitations of this film. Polly Walker was very convincing as a sensitive, but hypercritical wife. In fact, I'd say she provided the best performance, and her character was the most three-dimensional and human. They should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character.   Norman Reedus was fairly genuine as the young man, although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive. He failed to grab my empathy. Which makes the plot of the movie more implausible ... that a jaded, wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment.  Alan Rickman did his usual subtle work, but it was so subtle that I thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming. His attempt at an American accent did not fly too well. Later in the movie, however, he becomes much more interesting.   The end lacked passion and was not surprising at all; it was entirely predictable.  For Rickmanistas, yes, you get to see Alan naked. So, just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy.  I have always admired Alan Rickman - I'm a big fan - but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted & directed film.  So, I give it two stars. *Yawn 
 I spent years waiting for this novel. And then I finally got it from my wife for my birthday. I have to say that I was quite disappointed.   First, the conflict in the story is presented in such a fashion that it is hard to be anything but detached from it. While I am aware that I am from Generation Why and am divorced from the concept of caring about fictional or real characters and their trials and tribulations, the fact of the matter is that it was remarkably difficult to really care about ANYTHING that happened in this book, including the gang rape of the inhabitants of the tower.  What should have been an interesting study in the strife and malfunction of human relationships, the stranding of a thousand people on a desert island in the middle of a society that they are functionally free to escape to at any time, was underdeveloped and overprocessed. The result was that a wonderful story premise was destroyed. We know why three or four of the characters stayed in the tower. What about the rest? We only know anything about three of the characters in the entire story, and their motivations seem...lacking for the determination to survive and thrive in this environment that they are presented in.   If you want a dystopian epic about what can go wrong in a building like this, go pick up Neal Stephenson's The Big U. It is far more credible and far more entertaining. Much better overall.  The two good things about this: The first paragraph and the last page. The nihilism and the destruction wrought by the people in the first tower makes reading the book tolerable. And the first paragraph is the single most interesting beginning of a story that I have ever read. These two things are why it is getting a star above minimum.  Go read something better. This is overrated.  Harkiu 
 I have to strongly disagree with the editorial and reader reviews on this essay, even though it was a national bestseller. The book is touted as possibly the most rational description of a descent into morbid, clinical depression and suicidal despair. I didn't find it so. Styron was descriptive but rather than probing and baring the depths of his mind and emotions during his depression, I felt he only hinted at the tip of the iceberg. I didn't find any riveting, palpable tracing of his depression. It was rather moribund for a subject with such potential. There is a detachment throughout that many attribute to Styron's calculating dismantling of his own emotions to throw light into the abyss. I found the detachment sort of hovering over the pond, unwilling to dive in, which robs the reader. Candor, yes in some aspects. Precision, somewhat missing.  He quotes Dante "In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a dark wood, for I had lost the right path." Styron was in the melancholia described by Dante but he never succeeds at identifying why or even how he managed to eventually recover.  From what most reviewers have said, this book should have been the definitive treatise on deep depression, written by a survivor. It is not that impressive at all

 If you are looking for every detail known to modern man regarding all of the OTHER movies Mel Gibson ever starred in or directed, this is the book for you.  If you are looking for true insight into The Passion, just skip to the last few pages and you will still be disappointed.  I, too, am ashamed to say I spent a good deal of time wading through all of the details in the bulk of this book, hoping to get to the point.  Very disappointing 
 This book says nothing useful, and not much that isn't an anecdotal stereotype.  Save your money! 
 I can't comment on this one because it was lost on delivery twice along with the other two purchased items. It's a real bizzard 
 Tedious overall; notable are the funny, puzzlingly surreal, world's worst similes.  "The animals sprinted to the kitchen at her heels like hungry Secret Service agents...."  Hunh 
 I have friends who might be into this stuff, if only because they like the old and the strange. Me, I'm just like -- Is this "It's a Wonderful Life"?  I think I might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if I picked up the script. As it is, this just barely seems to translate into a movie, and--forgive me for I have my own opinion--"City of Angels" was a good movie. Too bad if you don't like all this "contemporary nonsense." I feel like it worked.  My opinion: it's long, it's boring, it's hard to hear. Even if it has a message, I just can't relate to it. So maybe that's my problem.  Your opinion: your own. keep it. you're lucky I gave it two stars 
 I bought one of these for my small cat.  When I looked the collar over I found I was able to pull on one of the two adjustable portions and the collar tightened.  While that is good for adjusting size, it also would choke the cat if just this part of the collar was snagged.  I tossed it 
 Much of this book read as it was advertised.  It was a stark look at the institute of marriage.  It was indeed dark in humor, and the characters were very interesting and complex.  If it were just advertised as an  entertainging, fictional read, based on these characters I wouldn't have as  much of a problem with it. (Other than it's terribly flat conclusion).  But  when it is touted as a "required read before obtaining a marriage  license" that is where I have a big problem with this book.  The men  in this book are all terribly flawed as far as morality, character, and  self-centeredness issues are concerned.  The problems or faults of the  women in the story, can all be traced back to a man, and are.  It causes me  to wonder if the author, and I say this with absolutley no malice, or  insult intended, is gay.  That would help explain the obvious slant against  the man in traditional male-female relationships.  The mothers role in the  traumatic episode with her young daughter is almost totally ignored, and  she never was asked to be accountable for it.  Yet the Man had to be  "broken" because of it.  I thought for it to be a book to truly  gain insight before marriage, it could have spent more time on the two way  streets of real life, rather than the one way, dead end street this book  ended up on 
 Just not a good book.  Not very well written.  No real insight, lessons learned, etc.  Just not worth reading 
 What the ----.  "A tale of revenge"?  Why does everyone in their review say that?  B/c it's written on the box cover??  This is an interesting and compelling movie, but w/ a very odd, abrupt ending that leaves you hitting the "REWIND" button and saying, "what a minute, is it OVER??  Did I miss something??"  Afte watching this, I scoured the internet, Wikipeida, and Amazon...still no reviewer seems able to say what was meant by the ending of this film.  My takeaway on it -- she is going to hang, and die (go to heaven);  he is going to stay on Earth..but maybe when they meet again (heaven), they can get married.  ??  ????  How come no one else can come up w/ a definitive meaning to the end of this film?  Subtlety is great, but not if it's so damn ambiguous that NOBODY in the universe seems to be able to define or explain what this film was all about.  It was NOT about revenge.  Maybe it was about love and obsession and sadness and the silliness of despair.   Sorry, can't really recommend this one! 
 Verne's publisher called this "lackluster and lifeless," so it was locked up in a safe and never released.  Reading it, I can understand why. The characters are boring and predictable, and the dialogue is flat. Verne's vision of the future is not particularly intriguing.  Really, this book is only worth reading for Verne's sometimes prophetic predictions. He imagines the elevator, the automobile and fax machines, for example.  Not horrible, but not up to the standard I expect from Verne 
 This book shows how Robert has been lying all along. He talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless. Ok then, how did Robert make the monthly payment? Why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a Porsch as a bum? This guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses. He is a conman and a good one. Thats why hes a motivational speaker. It takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money. Don't fall for this conman! This book contradicts what Robert has been preaching in previous books. Robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless. That would be odd but it isn't odd because Robert is a professional liar 
 Looked nice and plain in the picture and it was on sale. Got it and was all doily and fru fru at the top. Gave it to a girl I know 
 I find the subject matter of the transition between the middle ages and the renaissance as a fascinating period.  This book focuses on the life and times of John of Gaunt, prince of England and the Duke of Lancaster.  One of the most powerful English Dukes who never became King, he is indeed an interesting figure and there is much of the book that is interesting in that regard.  I found the portrayal by the author of Gaunt as a pragmatist quite convincing in the context of the turbulent times that Gaunt dominated English politics.  His flirtations with the heresies of Wycliff and the patronage of the budding English humanism you find in Chaucer contrasts sharpely with a man devoted to English institutions and the well being of the Plantagenet dynasty.  There is much to recommend in this book that I enjoyed reading.  However, I found the author's writing style labored and difficult.  Some editorial comments meant to sound witty seemed out of place and detracted rather than added to the enjoyment of the book.  There were also some sentences that needed a good editor to correct some structure problems and even correct some spelling errors.  Unsupported assertions were also rife in the book.  Most disturbing was the fact that there were some significant historical inaccuracies in the book.For example, the author mentions a daughter of Gaunt and Catherine Swynford, Margaret Beaufort, who married Edmond Tudor who was the mother of Henry VII.  A little genealogical research shows that Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII was the daughter of John Beaufort, who was the son of John "Fairborn" Beaufort who was the son of John of Gaunt.  That makes Margaret Beaufort the great grand-daughter of John of Gaunt, a two generation discrepancy.  He also lists John Duke of Bedford as a grandson correctly since he was the son of Henry IV.  However he then goes on to list Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Bedford's younger brother, as John of Gaunt's great-grandson.  A second pair of eyes and a good editor should have been able to detect these errors and correct them.    The writing style and editing problems detract significantly from the overall historical value of this book.  If the author had remained alive, I would have hoped he would in the future revise the book, correct the problems and perhaps add some more information about Gaunt's Beaufort children and grand-children who were so significant in the political history  of England in the 15th Century.    Some day, I hope a better writer comes along and takes the subject matter Norman Cantor addressed and presents it in a more substantial and substantiated way.   
 The author spends the entire book pontificating about how eBay has and will change the way consumers buy and sell things. While he has this general trend correct, and this is interesting to ponder, the author uses the book as a platform to conveniently mention and promote (by name) his own auction dropshop business.   Further, he states that soon auction dropshop locations will be as prevalently widespread as Starbucks. I think not. In fact, the auction dropshop store that opened in my neighborhood closed due to lack of interest after just a few months.  The fact is eBay and other online auction sites are changing things because they eliminate a middle man and wonderfully facilitate consumer to consumer transactions. That the author is a middle man himself is telling. And that he seems to believe that these dropshop businesses will thrive is way off base, and demonstrates a clouded lack of understanding of the marketplace based upon his own ulterior motives.  The book is not well-written either. Each chapter seems just like a re-read of the last chapter (like filler) and it doesn't really progress any new ideas that weren't already made early on in the book.    
 it is juust a copy of the frist book. if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time. jo 
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
 I have never once reviewed a product on Amazon or anywhere else, but like the other ADULT reviewers, felt parents/teachers should be warned about this book.  This book definitly should NOT say 8 and up.  My 9 year old picked this up at her school's book fair and I didn't think twice about it.  I just went up to tuck her in,  she was reading it and was very upset and confused about all the stories she has read.  Let's see, some of these stories include: the girl whose best friend was killed in a horrible accident, self mutilation, molestation by male babysitter, anorexia/bulemia issues, suicide, girls who are relentlessly bullied and boy chasing.  These are topics that are very real and some are quite graphic, if it was a movie it would be rated R, why is it OK to market this book to 8 year olds?  She is a mature 9, but is not at all ready to handle most of these issues. If I have to recommend this book, it would be for at least 13 and up, or at the very least read it yourself before handing it to a child  thinking it's an 'uplifting' book for girls. I consider myself fairly liberal and easy-going, but will be discussing the sale of this book with the school librarian (k-4) before the next book fair.  I really feel like a bit of my daughter's childhood was just swept away in 30 minutes, as corny as that sounds.  I blame myself, I should've read it first or at least skimmed it instead of assuming it would be about girls rescuing puppies, lending a hand to a handicapped friend or the pressure of selling girl scout cookies!  
 The message meant more to me than to my young children.  They didnt understand why the children were being locked in a box.  They think playing in cardboard boxes is fun, not a punishment for exercising too much freedom.  I could see using the book as a basis for discussion, but I think it may just scare children that they too could be locked up by their parents 
 There are much better books for those learning to cook.  I was reviewing this to see if any "How to ook" cookbooks were actually good at teaching folks how to cook well.  It did not at all in my opinion.  Folks need to know things that good cooks & chefs take for granted.  
 I found this book while trying to find a book I first heard about in the early 80's.  I believe the title was something like "Contact: The First Three Seconds".  I'm hoping someone will read this and assist me with the actual title and/or Author of the book 
 Maguire is far from a good writer and after reading Wicked, which was better than this, you only need read the first page to have an idea of what to exspect.   A few short decades ago the character of Billy Bigalow from the musical CAROUSEL committed suicide in the stage version. It was so objectionable that in the movie his death was changed to an accident and the spouse abuse, although minimal and explained, generated a new ending where Billy, comes down from heaven to whispers words of hope to his daughter and speaks of his love for his wife in both the stage version and the movie. I had no problem with the changes to the end. After all the play LILIOM, which was the basis of the musical was very morose, but the compromise on the suicide seemed needless even for Hollywood as it was allowed in the stage version. You may wonder where I am going with this. Considering SON OF A WITCH as a possible musical, which is being considered, is more than I care to contemplate. This strange, tedious and and extremely gruesome tale is not something I ever want to hear lyrics and music put to, and if WICKED was recommended for 8 years up (still too young in my opinion) a musical version of this would have to be 18 and older 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 This slim book, prominently featured on Arab and Nazi websites, is a collection of fevered fulminations by a leftist idealogue who, though Jewish by birth, chose to align himself with those who wish the demise of the Jewish state.  His presentations of Judaism, in which he claims that Jews are actually polytheists, are pure fiction, as even an elementary student of Judaism will realize.  This volume is not so much a book as an axe-grinding exercise, lacking any scholarly merit. This book will find an audience among enemies of the Jewish people and leftist cranks.   
 I must begin my review by stating that I am a reader of all memoirs because I find them to be healing for the soul. The best memoirs are honest accounts, whether the truth is devastating, beautiful or just plain boring.  I bought 'A Piece of Cake' because the rave reviews and because it was becoming available in paperback. After finishing 'A Piece of Cake', I must be honest that it is one of the worst memoirs I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The writing seemed to be done by a grade schooler: repetitive, juvenile and inconsistent - but this is not the reason the book is so bad. 'A Piece of Cake' is not a good read because I just don't believe 90% of what Miss Brown wrote.  I believe bad things can happen to a child in foster care, that kids in the ghetto get caught up in the gang lifestyle and addicts have a lot of interesting stories to tell. The reason I don't believe Miss Brown is that there is no honesty in her literary voice. Her stories are built from rusty crumbs and do not hold solid.  There are so many instances in the book that don't hold up to the light, but the most glaring untruth seems to be that the state of California would award custody of Miss Brown and her brother to their biological father and at the same time pay state dollars to a foster parent for their care. This especially seems untrue since there were other blood relatives who wished to take on the responsibility of caring for Miss Brown and her brother without the state's money. Since the whole book is based on this foundation, the whole story crumbles.  After reading 'A Piece of Cake', it is my feeling that Miss Brown was faced with many hardships in her young life and chose a road of self-destruction. She was able to climb out of the gutter and this is always a wonderful thing, but it does not necessarily mean that one's story should be made into a book.  Cupcake Brown obviously has many devoted fans of her book and I'm in the minority with my criticism. However, I stand by my review 100%.  Some memoirs that I highly recommend are:  'The Glass Castle: A Memoir' by Jeannette Walls 'Ava's Man' by Rick Bragg 'Angela's Ashes' by Frank McCourt 'Blackbird : A Childhood Lost and Found' by Jennifer Lauck 'Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith' & 'Operating Instructions' by Anne Lamott (or anything else by Anne Lamott) 'Running with Scissors: A Memoir' by Augusten Burroughs 'Naked' by David Sedari 
 Native Tongue  by Carl Hiaasen   This book is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and a zany weirdness.  No doubt, it is a page-turner.  And it is better than the other book of Hiaasen's I have read, Double Whammy.  But all that does not a good read make...  A strength of Hiaasen's books are his characters, well defined and numerous.  Most are straightforward stereotypes, from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist, the vapid sex-phone girlfriend, a steroid-doped strongman, the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy, a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop, to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars, and loads of redneck Florida "crackers".  Hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops, and by casting two characters that are quite original, an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman, and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman.  And we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins.  Etc. etc.  So what's wrong.  Mainly, it's that the book stays at a level of TV-sitcom-gone-book.  It achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject.  One might think that the exception is the environment, but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here.  So perhaps Native Tongue is just pure entertainment?  If you like brainless action, gratuitous violence, gross humor, and zany "fun", Native Tongue might satisfy.    I have one additional problem with Hiassen, and it's similar to the problem I so often have with Michael Crichton.  These books stink of hypocrisy.  Crichton makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science.  Hiassen's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society, but Hiaasen's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness.   While I enjoyed a few sections of Native Tongue, I had no doubts at the end that I had wasted many hours that should have been better spent 
 I'm on my third Mighty Mouse in 3 years. At $50 a pop, I expect them to last longer! Inevitably, after about a year or so, the trackball stops scrolling in one direction or another. I tried cleaning it with compressed air, but no luck. I always admire the MM's functions for 12 or so months, and then BAM! It chokes 
 NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES ARE FAKE!!!!I WAS CLINICALLY DEAD FOR 6 AND A HALF MINUTES. DURING THAT TIME I SAW NOTHING. AFTER DEATH YOU CEASE TO EXIST. NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE STORIES ARE MADE UP SO AUTHORS CAN MAKE MONEY ON PEOPLES FEAR OF DEATH. DONT SUPPORT THESE CON ARTISTS. 
 This is the first time I delved into the HellRaiser series, and I have to admit, I kind of regret it. The film opens with a collage of disturbing images, I guess to get my attention, but there is no real reason for them to be there. From there the film falls into a freefall where it jumps from one messed up scene to the next. It all looks perfectly twisted, but who really cares. Clive Barker, as he did in "Night Breed," shows his taste for creative costumes and set designs. Of course they are all very self-indulgent, but beautiful nonetheless in their own little way. Had this film showed up at a modern art museum I would have labeled it pretentious. But since it showed up in movie theaters I have no choice but to label it crap.  I would love to describe the plot to you, but it didn't make a ton of sense to me. Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is in a mental hospital and is convinced that her dad is calling out to her from inside hell, and thus she must go save him. Meanwhile her evil step-mom (and speaking from experience they are all evil) is reemerging from hell with the distinct disadvantage of not having any skin. Upon her return she uses her bloody pulp of a body to engage in a sexual act with another evil doer. I'm sure that gets laughs every time from the children who are watching, but to me it was silly and unnecessary. She goes on a quest for skin which goes off without a hitch, and from there a battle ensues between Kirsty and her step-mom over the soul of a little girl named Tiffany (or so everybody calls her). The whole point seems to be that our minds make up our own personal hells, and that is an idea I can get on board with. One overview shot of hell has it looking strikingly similar to an M.C. Escher print. With dead ends and trap doors and boogeymen we all travel through the labyrinth of our mind on a daily basis. But I cannot get on board with this film. It is sensational for the sake of sensationalism, which is fine with me, but not when it is mixed with a brain dead plot. What do I, or anybody for that matter, get from watching a man carve himself up with a knife? I guess that at least it is not soft like modern horror movies, but this one does not earn its gore.  For those of you who demand nothing out of your movies other than the experience of a bad dream where nothing makes sense then this is your film. For the rest of you this is failed storytelling of the highest degree. I still have "HellRaiser" on my shelf to watch and I must say it won't be hard for that one to top this mess. I may never understand why people think atmosphere is enough to create a scary movie. It is the major flaw of this film and Japanese Horror in general, but I want a story to go with my scares. What this one is selling is a chance to be grossed out of your mind or bored stiff. . .or both. I hated this movie, and no I don't care how realistic it looked when the characters were peeling the skin off of their faces. *1/2 
 Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new "web 2.0" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir 
 The first time my daughter played with this book she bit a hole in the plastic which covers the snail.  The thin plastic -- akin to saran wrap -- came off with a little pulling.  I think it presents a serious choking hazard; I am returning the book. 
 Biggest waste of $35 I've ever seen ! This was a required text in school , and approximatly 25% of the formulas were completely unusable. It was if this character wrote these recipes off the top of his head without the  slightest concern for whether they worked or not.I shudder to think how  many copies of this waste of paper have been sold to culinary students and  the general public alike 
 This book could quite possibly be the most poorly-written book that I have ever read.  The most glaring flaw is that the last approximately 40 pages are completely irrelevant compared with the rest of the book.  Since the book is only 200 pages long, this is quite a tangent for the author to take.  Within this section, the narrator descends into a self-pitying diary of his early adult years.  I would like to point out that the plot of the book originally centered around his last year of high school.  Past this, the rest of the book suffers from a lack of development.  Many new characters and conflicts are introduced, only to disappear in the next chapter.  The main character never develops, and the reader does not have the ability to empathize with his internal struggles.  The book simply does not have redeeming qualities, and even takes a few moments to trash Ayn Rand; since this is a book that young adults will probably read, it prevents them from forming and informed opinion about that author, controversial as she is.  I was surprised and disappointed that this book was nominated for the Pen/Faulkner award.  I strongly suggest that inquisitive readers look elsewhere for even mediocre reading material. 0 stars 
 This author unfortunatly gives Christians a bad name.  Not only does he profess that the KJV Bible is the ONLY viable translation (just read the introduction) but he also believes, "Satan has despised America for her unique relationship to the King James Bible..." (p. 329).  I guess he doesn't understand the preservation of God's Word or understand Greek, but I could be wrong.  Basically my title states it best: Stupid people will believe anything, for anyone who buys this book and believes Dr. Grady is a truly a winner.  Now I will state that there are a few truths to Dr. Grady's claims (probably more than I am even willing to admit), however the structure of his book is very laughable and his broad claims concerning the KJV and the numerous Scriputure verses taken out of context ruin any chance of believability.  This book clearly falls under the category of Christian Conspiracy Theory.  I'll leave you with one last quote from this book that summs up my feelings, "An exaggerated Masonic connection with the birth of our republic has led many well-intended conspiracy writers to overreact, sometimes to the brink of lunacy" (p. 330).  Well at least he knows how to describe himself 
 I had read the book Black Thorn White rose before picking up this anthology and had a lot of hopes for this book. I love the retelling of fairy tales even with a dark twist to them. However, some of the stories in this book are absolutely horrific. The Match Girl, in my opinion, does not belong in a collection of fantasy but instead perhaps in one of horror. Its been a week since I read this book and I still have a bad taste left from it 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 Out of the Furnace was the assigned "text" for the first half of a 3-unit American History (after the Civil War) class. As a responsible and voracious reader, I bought and began reading the book. I found the style conclusory and turgid--this happened, that happened, something else happened--without any real character development to differentiate between and among the characters and clarify their relationships. As another reviewer observed, names kept changing and keeping the people sorted out was nearly impossible. Facts and emotions were asserted without textual basis or amplification, making it difficult for this reader to get interested in the book. For example, one plant was deemed "more dangerous" than the others--What does this mean? How was this known?  The cover lines on this book read "Long out of print" and I would say, "with good reason." Because the book was produced in 1941 by a writer describing life two generations earlier, there is not the detail and immediacy the reader gets from "Grapes of Wrath," for example, for which Steinbeck did actual site-visit research. Needless to say, the "direct" writing of "Furnace" makes it, as another reviewer noted, stultifying reading.  Further I seriously question the assignment of a novel written so long after the events "described," as the ONLY assigned text for this period in a history class. A variety of first-person reports (letters or other documents), statistical descriptions of wages, housing conditions, hours worked/injury rates, profit statements of the corporations, plus photographs of the living/working conditions would be more effective inconveying the same message.  I will confess I did not finish the book. Having determined that it was, in my opinion, unreadable, I dropped the class 
 I have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more. The language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words. These books can cause you embaesment, since I read where ever I have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it. Please we would all like to see more of these 
 This book is basically a compilation of different things, most of them pretty useless. In particular, all the mathematical part is in view of the recent developments of network theory, totally obsolete. It seems a better investment to buy a network theory book or a "real" sociology book 
 I expected good things from this book, but was surprised to find it offered very little useful advice.  The examples of what to do in certain situations must have been jokes, they were that inappropriate and irrelevant to real life.  Amazingly, the book was also racist at times, making odd comments about Muslims.  I actually tossed this book in the garbage, a first for me. 
 Even though the questions here are good practice because they are so difficult, the explanations offered are incomplete or unenlightening or both. As a study guide, it is a resounding failure. Some answers are unreasonable and some questions --like one about pushing buttoms to get certain results, and then figuring out how to do the same if one button stops working-- are ridculous because there is no way to answer a question like that in the alloted time unless you are a computer. As such, it has no practical value for the LSAT.  Do not buy this book to learn about the LSAT  because you won't - you will only be confused and discouraged. One "piece of advice" that I found inappropriate (and symbolic of the attitude in the entire book) was where it says something like "let's face it, not everyone can score a 170." That may be true but it is the wrong thing to say in a book that purports to help you get there. Some of the answer explanations read something like: "Yuck! Luckily the answer is "A" so you do not have to go further down the list." Overall, I would only recommend this book if you are doing so well in practice tests that you are bored, it is a Sunday, there is nothing to do, you want a good challenge, and can tell the difference between difficult questions and absurd ones. 
 I am an avid reader, and I will finish a book no matter how difficult it is, or how boring it is, and I couldn't finish this one. It was so dry - and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I was really disappointed 
 I saw this crapfest in the theater and I should have known what I was getting into when we were carded not only at the ticket window, but at the entrance of the theater as well.  I only gave it one star because there wasn't a "no star" rating--even though it deserves a negative rating.    As a horror fan, I was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie started, it seemed to have alot of promise.  But once we met Baby and her "family" the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate.  The movie was disgusting, repulsive, and made no clear sense--at least with Michael or Freddie you knew what the h*ll was going on.  And I thought that Blood Sucking Freaks and Blood Sucking Vampires from Pittsburgh sucked, but Corpses not only sucked, it blew. As a friend told me later, "What in the h*ll did you expect from Rob Zombie?"  What did I expect indeed.  No wonder most production firms refused to touch this film 
 Product was supposedly shipped 1-4-07 and still do not have i 
 About average for the price, nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight.  The wide beam is fairly faint, with a strong central spot.  This one will go out into the garage, and likely stay there. 
 This book ruined a perfectly good plane ride.    I felt ripped off by the two pages of blurbmeister babble.  It's fine for a novel to be 'dark' but this was ridiculous.  I was actually interested in the world of probation, but I am unconvinced that I know ANYTHING more or better about it 
 A very adolescent work. Definitely not worth reading, despite the fact that Kosinsky had won an award for this book 
 This was my first Catherine Coulter book and my last.  MAYBE, the author was trying to portray life during those times, but rape scenes between the hero & heroine isn't exactly what I'd call romantic...  One other little quirk I had was during her pregnancy...so..her husband pushed her down like a boulder, got stabbed in the side by a knife in the process, husband's ex-lover kicked her in the belly during a cat fight, fell off a cliff and hanging down on that cliff and STILL managed to keep the baby!?!?!   Nothing made sense in the entire book.. from the characters, to the plots, and to the title...nothing made sense! Like one reader was saying, its so bad its good 
 The Berenstain Bears and the Messy Room is about Bother and Sister Bear who never clean their room. One day, Momma bear had enough and made the cubs change their way. After talking, they decide to do something about it.  This book teaches children about responsibility. This book is good for children from 4-11. I thought it was a pretty good book 
 this is the absolute worst book i have ever been forced to and have ever read. i would like to add that i made a very strong attempt to get more interested in the plot of this book because it was a school assignment, but jeez, this was cruel and unusual punishment. when i think of this book, the word that comes to mind is "torture". i like a number of books and i love to read, i usually don't have a problem with book assignments, but this was just...just really mean. If you are smart, you will take my advice and stay far away.  
 I wish I came here first before allowing my 5 yr old daughter to save and buy this movie, we own the original (non 3D version) and she knew the 3D version was the same movie but was excited about the 3D aspect and the commercial rums every 15 mins here so she asked if she could get it.    We made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half, (at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart), finally got up the money to go buy the 3D version, got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn, Mom Dad Daughter, then we realized Bibble pops on and says take glasses OFF after a few mins of intro 3D?  15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses ON again etc, overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3D and most of it NOT in parts you would even WANT to see 3D action...  Needless to say having already bought the first release, even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3D feature, it falls short bigtime due to the LACK of 3D in the movie.  Buy the original it's better, and it IS a good movie!  Just having kids take off the 3D glasses 5+ times per showing (expecting them to hold them I guess?) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3D segments is just asking for broken paper 3D glasses and leads to an overall DUD of a supposed 3D release 
 The description in the book order made this sound like it would be a fun book but the first time I read it, I was horrified by the bad values that the book teaches.  After the kid scares everyone into passing out, he takes their bags of candy, but he doesn't stop there.  He actually goes into someone's house and takes all the candy on the table, but he doesn't stop there either.  He goes to their refrigerator and takes everything from it too.  Not only does the book condone stealing, but it wasn't even funny either.  I expected it to be amusing, but really it was just plain stupid.  If you were considering buying this book, don't 
 The jar is very nice looking, but the spigot is most difficult to use.  It is a needle valve type spigot that takes about 8 turns to open and close.  By the time you get the valve closed, most of your drink is on the floor.  I would not recomend this item 
 Sorry.  I'm as big of a Bowie fan as anyone, but I have to be objective and honest: Bowie's output from 'Let's Dance' through this album, 'Earthling', just flat out sucked.  Sure, there were good tracks here and there, but Bowie's heart just seemed to not be in his music.  In the '70's, he changed from style-to-style and developed his reputation as a musical chameleon...but COMMITMENT was in each of those recordings.  Beginning with 'Let's Dance', it almost seemed as if he felt a need to constantly change to live up to his reputation and keep current and modern, but his head was somewhere else.  Take this album.  It's supposed to be club music and electronically-disco based, but that style combined with Bowie's Anthony Newley-styled vocals just clash and the overall effect is more irritating than enchanting.  The opening track, "Little Wonder", is such an alarming turn-off that it's hard not to turn the damn thing off without listening to the rest of the CD.  Thankfully, beginning with his next album, 1999's 'Hours', Bowie seemed content to accept his past, his legend and his legacy without having to jump aboard every musical trend that pops up.  The result has been three excellent albums in a row ('Hours', 'Heathen', and 'Reality') 
 Perfect examlpe of how easily facts can be manipulated, to appear as the truth. How truths can be altered, yet appear as if they have not. And finally, how hard many will work, how far they will go, in attempts to turn the American People against our Government. I think the author should take up residence in Afganistan, I understand land there, is very cheap; especially now 
 The Road to Los Angeles; and Ask the Dust!!! 2 fantastic books. Raw, perceptive. Full of Life felt like a 'nice' book. Family, expectant fatherhood. OH! It was so sweet. I've come to like the Bandini stories.  Fante pulls out all the stops in the other books.   I got about half-way  through Full of Life and stuck it on the shel 
 My one question is basically... how come the author sets out guidelines that apparently (unless i misread the thing) SHE DIDN'T FOLLOW?!!  I mean she says to avoid going to places alone... and avoid situations where it would be only the two of you. But then she goes around and tells a story of how she and jim were alone. (?) and then she follows it up that if she wasn't filled with the Holy Spirit it would have been hard. (hello?)  
 This book did not help at all with the potty training.  My daughter loves Caillou and I thought it might help her figure out the potty.  It didn't 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 Lackey should have been a TV writer in the 70's & 80's. This tripe plays out so much like Magnum PI, they actually mention the series several times in the book! You can almost hear the cheese music as the 'action' unfolds. Omigod, the dialogue is so bad (inane), I actually started highlighting certain bits to relate to my friends. After reading MR Sellars and now this (I actually only read half of this, it was so bad) I officially give up on Pagan fiction. 
 The tortured language, the dialogue, is simply awful. His attempt to make the detective's conversations seem like Spencer is more like Shaft in drag and it fails miserably.   The sexual tension is gratuitous, seems forced as if added to make the book sell rather than spending the pages in deeper character building. It's rare that I won't finish even a bad look, but this one I finally threw at the wall at page 160.  Enough.   
 This is literally in the top 3 worst movies of all-time. Complete waste of time and life that I will never get back because of watching this crap. There's always some other movie, or show, or what have you that is a lot better than this 
 This is a good product - sounds great, gets good battery life, everything you'd hope for in an iPod dock.  But it has one major flaw.  The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.  If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good. 
 If it were possible to give this movie zero stars, i would have. Although it may have won an Academy Award and been considered great in it's day, it is now outdated and boring. Unless scenes of teenagers trying to have sex with anyone are interesting to you, then maybe you will find it interesting. When i say anyone, i do mean anyone. The main chracter, Sonny, who is a teenager sleeps with Ruth, wife of his footbal coach and the young girl, Jacy, sleeps with her mother's lover on a pool table. The film also attempts to bring up homosexuality but keeps it muted. You would think a movie called "The Last Picture Show" would be more about a picture show but it really has very little to do with the movie. There is some nudity which was huge for the time of it's release since it was practically unheard of. The film is also completely in black and white which was a choice of the director so the film could give a better feel of the time period, 1950's. This movie also gives a bad impression of those who live in the country, making them look like they are so bored of their desolate surroundings that they must seek sex with anyone who is willing. If this movie would have been made in present day, it would be your typical porn movie but since none of the sex scenes are actually shown they just show the faces and i guess that is what it allows it to be called an "award winning movie" and not a porn. Also if you think the movie was bad, try reading the book it was based off of, much worse 
 I have always been intrigued by Mr.Cramer, when I found this smallish book I decided to read what he had to say about the market crash. I hoped to find some deep insights from a man who is a Wall Street insider. I am very disappointed with the book, you probably will learn more about what caused the bubble to burst by reading newspapers and magazines then you would from this book. The material in the book is very superficial and the only thing that stuck was that he was shamelessly using it as a means to advertise his web site and alert service. If you have loads of money that you want to waste, please mail it to Mr. Cramer at least then you will save a tree 
 This griddle performed very poorly and I will not be keeping it.  It cooked very unevenly (the left side of a 4-inch pancake was almost burned, while the right side was practically raw) and the pancakes stuck, even though it is supposed to be preseasoned (it's cast iron) and I heated it first before applying a light coat of vegetable oil.  It also did not sit securely on my gas stove, due to the 'grill' ridges on the other side -- it rocks back and forth slightly--even thought the box says it is suitable for all cooking surfaces except glass.    Because I use my griddle almost every weekend, I am considering the Broil King Ultra Large electric giddle, which got Cook's Illustrated top recommendation in its 2003 tests.    
 Well, I can't say that the storyline of the Dr. Moreau flicks is bad, it's an interesting blend of scientific and horrific.  The 70's version of the film is actually pretty good.  This update adds some more color to the characters, and some more advanced makeup and better visual effects.  Well, if it weren't for the poor script this might be a worthwhile film.  The movie starts off with an interesting naration, but 2/3 characters are killed after about 30 seconds and we never get to know them or care about them, which isn't good.  They should've started it off in the airplane instead of the exact same way the 70's version started.  Also, the editing of this movie is probably the worst I have ever seen of any film.  The best example of this is a scene that ends with Dr. Moreau saying "Tomorrow we will have a trial" and the next scene shows the main character trying to escape on a boat and being threantened, not attacked, by BADLY animated mutant rats.  The next scene is the trial, and the rats never show up in the movie again and are never mentioned by anyone.  Who had the brains to do that?  There are plenty of other examples, but see for yourself.  I'm not sure about this unrated director's cut, but I doubt it can save this mess.  There are scenes that cut to a completely different location involving the same characters that seemingly pop up there in no time.  The movie doesn't make any sense, and there isn't enough development of, say, oh, DR. MOREAU.  He is the title character isn't he?  Well, he gets killed off way too early, and it's just not satisfying as he has no real defining roll in the climax of the film.  I can't say you shouldn't see this, it's a little interesting to see editing and writing's negative effects on a movie if you don't know what I'm talking about, but if you don't want to see a bad movie, don't see this 
 This text is absolutely inadequate in the gastrointestinal physiology area for the level it proposes to teach.  They really need to get someone who understands this area to help them out 
 My report was done on Bradbury Speaks Too soon from the cave, too far from the stars. At first this book looked very interesting. It said it would talk about space and how we would get to it and how far have we really come from earlier man. But I was proven wrong by the book. The book discusses Bradbury's life and how he met important people and interviews that went into the stuff described but it was really not at all about the future and space. That was the first sign of trouble. I then began to actually read the book. Oh boy was that hard. The context of the literature is so hard to understand. This was one of the most challenging books I have ever read. It wasn't hard language it was just the way he used it. I struggled all the way through this book just trying to understand what the heck he meant. When I finally did start too understand the book was still a huge bore.  All he would write about was himself and for all I could read about this book it didn't say anywhere that this was an autobiographical book. It says that the stories are written by students and journalists that have Bradbury. But they all sound like they are his words. Like that they are all in first person and they don't come from an interviewer's point of view. This really ticked me off. This book was down right hard. Now the stories themselves were really difficult. He wrote as if he had no personality. Giving only facts and making the stories dull and uninteresting. Half of them I couldn't even understand what they were about. They are so factual and have absolutely now pizzazz to them. This book gave me a sense of that no one knows what's going to happen to the human race. The book made me both sad and crazy. Crazy because he can't go directly to the point with out having a confusing remark that sent you off another road of thinking. So you would forget all about what you just read and have to start all over again. This is a book that requires too much attention from one person. All the stories talk about is how he met important people and how he likes the rain. Witch is really stupid. The book followed nothing from what you expect it to be. I would now read it if I were you. If you want a really good book about the future past and present don't look here. But if you are looking for a dull boring something you would read if you had to this would be the book for you. I lost interest in the book since the first page but I had to keep going because it was for school. Other wise I wouldn't bother with the book. I mean even the really weird Hitchcock films were better that this book. I would sit through one thousand Star Wars Episode I movies if I could not read this book again. I would not suggest this book for my life!  
 Although his interesting childhood kept you glued to the first quarter of the book, the rest is just a basic cowboy's life written with little or no techniques to keep you compelled to read every word. It is interesting to read, however, since he was a true to life cowboy. If I had to do over, I'd saved my money. 
 uh......... no this book had litle to be desired and its just not cool with all them big words i mean come on.  Whats a sherry and what is an  amontdillo i dont even know. loserbook. Go Central High Footbal 
 The photos are beautiful, the designs are just wonderful...but if you have kids this is not real life. This is a magazine lifestyle. You could only do this if you had an unlimited budget, there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets. Sure my home could be organized if I had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built-ins, and all the baskets I could buy! Stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table. 
 I have to start by saying my kids love this bike.  I have a 2, a 4, and a 6 year old.  They all can ride this bike because of its versatility.    The problem is with the front wheel.  And you can't have a working bike without a working front wheel.  We bought this bike for Christmas, 2006.  3 months later, the rubber strip they call a tire, wore through, split and fell off.  The plastic rim is splitting.  Basically the front tire just fell apart.  Our other trike, the #33 Classic Red Dual Deck Tricycle has held up just fine, with a nice solid front wheel.  If your kids ride this as much as any normal, healthy, doesn't sit playing video games all day, kids do - then hold out on this one.  Get something with a better front wheel or wait till they redesign this front wheel 
 I thought the first three books by Slywotsky and co. were really good. But this one is really awful. The content -- digital business design -- can be summarized in one page. They just try to keep stretching the material to complete a book -- for the sole purpose of selling. The same point keeps being repeated again, again, and gain. Check the bibliography and read the sources. They are much better! Read the Profit Zone, Value Migration and Profit Patterns. They are much more relevant today though many principles are extremely difficult to apply in today's very unpredictable environment 
 the "power of Diana Gabaldon's writing" to this author's...Dream Stone stands on it's own, though it was not to my taste. Diana Gabaldon is in a league of her own...exclusively 
 These earphones are well put together and at the price they could be outstanding. The volume control alone make them a steal. The problem is that being behind the neck there is no adjustment for size. You can't wear them while relaxing in a chair because when you lay your head back, the earphones try to rip through the front of your ears. Add to this that there is no foam cushioning to the phones themselves and they are hard plastic circles than insert into your ears and it makes for PAIN.  Unless your ears are large enough to accomodate 1/2 inch discs inserted into them SIDEWAYS (like inserting dimes into your ears edgewise), you will not like the feeling. Add to this the fact that the speakers face forward instead of into the ears, and you have the problem of having to raise the volume higher than necessary.  So instead of a well designed product you have one that is badly designed from every aspect. These could be great earphones if Koss would make them adjustable, reduce the size of the speakers and turn them 90 degrees so they direct the sound down the ear canal and finally add some foam padding to cushion the speakers. The quality is excellent and the volume control is substantial and well made, not flimsy like most that I have seen. A company like Koss should know better. 
 i appreciate the nature of the subjest matter but, the book was short and pretty lame.  Many hackneyed anecdotes.  Im not sure why this book was even written.  Nothing funny or relevant is expressed in the boo 
 I love to read, and have all my life.  I don't know how I escaped reading "Mary Poppins" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book.  I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it.  I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it.  You'd have to use a microscope to find it.  Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting.  I don't have a problem with that.  My problem is Mary  herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book.  I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on.  Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book.  At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something.  In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice.  Watch the movie.  Forget the book 
 I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its "functionality" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being "propelled through every foot", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement.  BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.    *** UPdate *** November 15, 2006 It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible 
 You would think that when you buy a bracket of any sort, the package would include the mounting screws.  Well, this doesn't and you aren't made of aware of that until you open the box.  I'm a strong advocate of Linksys products but this falls under the category of "screw the customer" 
 As one pursuing a master's degree in Library Science, I was required to buy this book for my reference course.  I have found it to be poorly written and organized and of little practical use.  Someone out there must be able to know enough about reference techniques to write a more coherent and interesting text on the subject.  
 The only reason Susan McCrook wouldn't talk was she was afraid she'd end up taking an ADN (Arkansas dirt nap). Case closed 
 This book was terrible, and I would not recommend it for anyone, especially young teens. Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all 
 A detailed examination of the full transcript of the presentations made in Detroit in '71 shows they are a mix of reasonable, questionable, and really off-the-wall statements.  One of the stars, Scott Camil, has made a lifelong career of outlandish claims, most recently that an entire village was massacred by Marines who wanted the US combat boots the natives had all somehow acquired.  Since the average VN foot size is several sizes smaller than US and villagers didn't like American boots anyhow, this is patently absurd.  (He had also proposed assassinating US Senators.)  None of the claims of atrocities could be confirmed by the military investigators who later contacted those testifying, all of whom refused to cooperate.  (Since they were already out of the military, they could not have been prosecuted for any such incidents, so they had no reason to stay silent.)  Accepting the film at its face value, no matter how dramatic and real its contents seem, is well beyond risky.  There were undoubtedly individual atrocities committed by US soldiers in Viet Nam, as there have been in every war by every side.  But there was never a policy of inciting or encouraging such, and in fact there were courts-martial of soldiers for such occurrences.  Where do we hear of the trials of VC/NVA for the 4000-odd citizens of Hue very deliberately rounded up and murdered during Tet '68?  If you want to believe the USA is the source of all evil in the world, buy this DVD and you'll get years of enjoyment from it.  Otherwise, buy books by Gunter Lewy or Harry Summers or Lewis Sorley 
 There is a reason this recording is the best selling jazz album of all time. The music is magical - I loved it when I was a teenager in the early 70's (despite being a "rock" fan), and it's still special 35 years later. I highly recommend getting the pure CD format.   This disc is not a pure CD - it is a special new format called DualDisc, with "CD Audio"* on one side, and DVD video content and 5.1 audio on the other side. Seems like a great idea, a great way to get people to buy CD's instead of downloading them. NOT! Notice that asterisk next to "CD Audio"? There is a warning on the outside of the disk that it does not comply with the strict CD-Audio format, and it may not play on some CD or DVD players. If that was the only problem with this disc I say fine - the risk is worth the possible reward.    But no. Despite the added content of the DualDisc format with various extras, the DualDisc format is treacherous, very treacherous. If you want to play this "CD" (DualDisc - CD side) on a computer, on a Windows machine it installs a small hidden piece of software on your machine altering the driver for your CD or DVD drive reducing the CD/DVD's functionality. I have not yet been able to reverse the damage this disc has done to my machine's software despite reading many posts about methods to do this. I never agreed to any software installation (I never would have), and yet my CD/DVD drives have lost the ability to do DMA. And to add insult to injury, the DualDisc - CD side will not play on my computer - I cannot even listen to it where I spend many hours a day. Outrageous.  I've wasted so much time on this DualDisc that I haven't had the time to watch the DVD side content. Unbelievable that I paid for this abuse - this is the way the publisher Sony/BMG - Columbia treats a legitimate customer? I don't have enough words to describe my loathing for the purveyors of this current DualDisc product.  This DualDisc seems to violate the first rule of customer relations - "treat your customers with respect. 
 Since his retirement in 2000 as Bishop of the Episcopal Church in Newark, John Shelby Spong has fashioned himself as a leading spokesperson for a radically progressive Christianity. In a dozen or so books he has insisted that institutional Christianity must aggressively question the very essence of its faith inheritance, and not just in a cosmetic way that tinkers with the fringes. Rather, he admits that his drastic antidotes might kill the patient, although it is not clear that he would view that outcome as unfortunate (pp 58, 178). His current book is simply one more verse of this refrain. Given his unsparing and unflinching critique of a church he spent a lifetime serving, I wondered why he even wants to continue to identify himself as Christian. To be sure, his alternate proposal has at best only a tenuous connection to anything historically or theologically Christian.             I suspect that those who would like to address the very important question Spong's title purports to address will find his book disappointing. His style and tone throughout are condescending towards those with whom he disagrees (mainly anyone more conservative that he is). He categorically disparages these people as profoundly ignorant, duplicitous, repressed, and pitiable. Complex issues are oversimplified. Speculative and dubious opinions (Mary was Jesus's wife, Paul was a repressed homosexual, Judas did not exist) are offered as serious alternatives. He constantly invokes the weakest, weirdest, and most bizarre forms of arguments to dissect (straw man arguments). Finally, there is the feel of self-promotion and kitsch to this book. I mean, what are we to make of a dust jacket that includes a blurb by Bill O'Reilly of Fox News and the hype that "history will recognize Spong as one of the major change agents of modern Christianity." I tend to think of people like Spong as fundamentalist liberals.             All this is unfortunate because the ostensible subject of his book is so very important. What are we to make of the passages in the Bible itself that, upon simple reading, sound so horrible? Like God's command to exterminate the Canaanites, or the death penalty for cursing or breaking the sabbath? Paul's insinuation that homosexuality is God's punishment for improper worship? Related but slightly different, what about how so many believers have abused the Bible to support horrendous evils like slavery or genocide? Spong writes that he wants to "filter" the Bible through the sieve of contemporary knowledge; that is good and necessary. But we also need to learn to move in the opposite direction, to filter the world and all its evils through the Scriptures. Interpreting the ancient Scriptures in our contemporary world, then, is a complex task, and one is likely to find little serious help in Spong's shrill manifesto.             For a great orthodox-liberal dialogue, read the many exchanges between Tom Wright and Marcus Borg. For creedal development try Pelikan. For how and why religion becomes evil (a major theme for Spong), there is Charles Kimball. Showing very little awareness of how his own social location and theological commitments might have shaped his own thought, Spong exemplifies the dilemma of taking the Jeffersonian scissors to the text, which is that you end up with a Bible that looks remarkably like your own image 
 My main interest in buying this book was for information on Omaha high-low and overall I found this to be very disappointing. First, since the book is split between stud and omaha, I had little interest in the stud portion. Second, the information on Omaha was of a very general nature and not nearly as in-depth and specific as the Hold Em for Advanced Players by Sklansky. Why Omaha high-low didn't get its own book is beyond me, is it because the author just doesn't have that much strategy to share?  That was my feeling and I ended up selling my copy through amazon marketplace. I've found more useful information on Omaha strategy at online websites than in this book 
 I had previously written a review here charging Mr. Levenda with poor scholarship and libelous treatment of Mr. Aleister Crowley and "his occult orders," it has developed, on my own faulty memory of an article written by another author.  The irony of my accusing Mr. Levenda of inaccuracy based on my own forgetfulness has not been lost on me, and has been a gentleman in correcting my error.  I would like to apologize to Mr. Levenda for my thoughtlessness and plan on buying his -- I'm sure -- excellent book in reparation to him.  
 Nice going puto you set my buddy and his race back 200 years during your 15 minutes of fame 
  	The author of A Northern Light is Jennifer Donnelly.  She resides in Brooklyn, N.Y, with her husband and daughter as well as two greyhounds.  Other works by  the author  include Humble Pie and The Tea Rose.  A Northern Light was the winner of The Carnegie Medal, The Los Angeles Times Prize and A Michael L. Printz Award Honor Book.   	The intended purpose of this book was to address many issues that young people face growing up.  The main character, Mattie Gokey, has to go through many hardships and make many adult decisions in this novel.  Mattie lives with her Pa and younger sisters.  Other characters that play a large role in this book are Weaver, Royal, Minnie, Miss Wilcox and Grace Brown.  A murder takes place in this book that was based upon real events.  Even though the murder was an actual event, the characters are made up to help it come clearer to readers.  Grace Brown's body is found in the lake after she takes a boat ride.   She gives Mattie a bundle of letters to burn but when she is found dead, instead of burning them, Mattie begins to read them and discovers many important aspects of the murder.  Donnelly skips back and forth from past to present and takes us through part of Mattie's life.  She also adds alot of advanced vocabulary for Mattie's words of the day.  She also uses language of the time period to make the story  come to life better.   	Although this novel received many awards of excellence and I'm sure alot of people would greatly enjoy  reading it, I was not one of them.  At the beginning, I thought it was going to be a very exciting murder mystery, but was disappointed to discover that the murder played only a small part in the whole novel.  I did find it very interesting though that it was actually based on a real murder.  I would probably not recommend this book for someone who is looking for a murder mystery because the murder only plays a small part in the novel.  Also, I think the author could have labeled the chapters a little more clearly because it got a little confusing with all the switching back and forth between past and present.   	I would say the intended audience would be young adults and most likely just females.  It contained some adult content, such as some profanity, as well as some sexual content.  Boys would probably not enjoy this novel because it is, in some aspects, a love story.  There's "sparking" and affairs and dirty older men at the hotel.  A younger person would not understand or want to read something that involves such material.   	In conclusion, A Northern Light was not one of my  favorite books that I've ever read.  The audience range is very  small and also based upon gender.  It is a well written novel, it just doesn't spark alot of interest in many people.  It went into to much detail at some parts and not enough for other parts.  I think she should have made the murder a more important part of the novel because it would have made it much more exciting.  
 Burnt out the motor on the first one within 3 months, exchanged for a new one, burnt out the motor on the 2nd one within 6 months.  I only used the lower power setting and was only juicing carrots 
 This book was horribly written.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the analogies used... describing the American consumer as Wal-Mart's whores... that was great. However, a lot of the author's claims were highly unsubstantiated.  As a Wal-Mart associate, I know that a lot of what he said is untrue. We are NOT allowed to work off the clock, and we are not victims of Wal-Mart's corporate greed. I really like my job, and while I don't approve of all Wal-Mart's policies, I certainly don't think they're as bad as they are portrayed in this book. I'm sure many of the stories ARE true. However, if the author spent half as much time spotlighting GOOD things Wal-Mart did, this book would be much more balanced.  I'm not impressed by his research, the book is lacking in fact, and is full of baloney. The research he did do could have been much better presented. The book was rambling, he repeated himself constantly, and it just felt like the book was slapped together last minute to be rushed out onto Target shelves.. 
 I have recently purchase the epson 890 injet printer and was trying out the included roll of premium glossy paper.  The paper gets jam easily and photos comes out with streaks. I will definitely go for the regular 4X6 paper instead of the roll paper 
 As John Waters wrote in his first book, "Shock Value," 'there's GOOD bad taste...and there's BAD bad taste.' Author Jimmy McDonough may have been wise to consider this before choosing to write an entire book about exploitation flick bottom-feeder Andy Milligan.   Not that a decent book can't be written about a bad filmmaker. Rudolph Grey's bio on Ed Wood is a pretty entertaining, informative read, after all. But, as presented by the author, Milligan's world of pervs, pederasts and theater rejects becomes more ho-hum than hair-raising. We're supposed to be shocked (I think) by the depravity of these people. Instead, just as in any Milligan film, the characters are too void of life to be very interesting.  Almost worse, as this book grinds on, it almost feels as if McDonough has lost sight of the fact that Andy Milligan made really, really, REALLY bad movies. Unlike the best films of, say, Herschell Gordon Lewis, there's no spark, no wit, no fun of any sort in a Milligan flick. Milligan's defenders will use words such as "gritty" and "merciless" to describe his work, thus placing it on a higher shelf than it deserves. Well, his films may indeed be gritty, but does that really excuse the fact that they're also unwatchable? And if they're so 'merciless,' does that make it okay that they're mercilessly boring too?  The long and short of it is that if Andy Milligan had any talent at all, he sure didn't show it in any of his movies. McDonough, in writing this book, seems to have gotten too close to his subject to see this. And in the author's hands, the story of Andy Milligan and his band of misfits just never catches fire. "The Ghastly One" might be a little better than an actual Milligan movie, but that's not exactly high praise. 
 "Chamber" was always the worst entry in the Harry Potter series, but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse. Choppy editing, horrible humor personified by the untalented Rupert Grint, smug acting by the equally untalented Emma Watson, poor screenwriting by that hack Steve Kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack Chris Columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience.   Skip it if you can. 
 I never received this book.  Apparently it had been sold to someone else the same time I bought it - that's fine, however, I had to write numerous emails inquiring on the status of the book.  I couldn't get a clear answer for over a week.  This seller just needs to respond with correct information so the buyers are able to make adjustments to find the bookd elsewhere.  I ws on a time constraint because this book was for school. 
 This is the second HD DVD that I've had issues with the XBox360 player, the other being Children of Men. Ironically, both are dual format. While Children of Men refused to play, this one refuses to go past chapter 12. I've had no issues with my PS3 playing any of the Blu-Ray movies so it begs the question, what is wrong with this format? I've got another dual format HD DVD/DVD disk that I'm going to try. Anyhoo, if you're using the XBox360 HD DVD player, this movie might not play all the way for you or might not even play at all 
 Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition.  Set as a kind of "Rockies Rear Window," this is one slow story.  Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through.  Finally skipped ahead to finish the book.  I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :(  If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend.  Not worth the price. 
      I was not as enthralled with this book as these other reviewers.   As an RN, I know a lot about nutrition, and have studied the subject for many years. I've also studied fasting quite a bit.        One of this book's strong points is the physiology of what happens when one fasts, but I must qualify that by saying that some of its scientific assertions are questionable, if not dangerous. For instance, he says it is fine for pregnant women to fast for 2-3 weeks. Most other authorities on fasting, many of whom are MD's, advise pregnant women not to fast, as it could result in brain damage to the fetus. It is certainly not something I would risk.   Other reviewers liked this author's exploration of feelings regarding food, and perhaps this is another one of the book's strong points. But again, some of his recommendations, in my opinion, are medically unsound. Two examples: First, he admonishes his readers to look deep into their childhoods,at   parental attitudes, and relationships with food, while fasting, in the wilderness.  It seems clear to me that looking deeply into one's childhood and attitudes would be better accomplished in formal therapy with a good therapist, than off by one's self in the wilderness. In fact, a wilderness setting wouldn't be safe.  It is well documented that one can become dehydrated, or hypokalemic (dangerously low in potassium) during fasting, especially if one has a pre-existing condition. Someone doing an extended fast should be under medical supervision, or at the least have other people available. Secondly, one's thinking could become distorted while alone in the wilderness without food for weeks on end. It is the job of a therapist to correct one's distorted thinking in a supportive environment.         Another big problem I have with this book is the author's philosophical confusion. At times he endorses Darwinian evolution, saying we are "evolutionarily" adapted for fasting. Darwinian theory assumes there is no supernatural. But through most of the book this author rhapsodizes on his beliefs in Earth worship, and the "aliveness" of all things.  Remember, he is founder of the Foundation for Gaian Studies (in case you don't know, Gaia is "mother Earth goddess"). He says that a main reason for fasting is to become open to what "the gods" have to tell you, especially about your purpose in life. How foolish to think one can find one's purpose from imaginary animistic sources. There is no purpose without God our Creator, who in the beginning, created the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1:1).         Bottom line, I would certainly be careful with what this author says, and read other authors on the subject of fasting. I recommend chapter 5 of "What the Bible Says About Healthy Living," by Rex Russell,MD, "Fasting: the Ultimate Diet," by Allan Cott, MD, and "Fasting and Eating for Health," by Joel Fuhrman, M.D. Also, go straight to the Book of All Books. Fasting is mentioned 74 times in the Bible. See especially Isaiah 58. 
 I do apologise to the seller but I havent been able to work out how to contact you! I havent received this and I was wondering if you can find out if it has been delivered.  I am getting a bit anxious cause my wedding is in 4 weeks.  Thank 
 If you want a VERY simple will or a VERY simple living will or power of attorney for health care, this program will work for you. However, it offers only a very narrow range of options for personalizing the generic forms included in the package. I disliked this program so much that I threw the whole package in the trash.  
 i luv tony yayo cuz he is so rill wit his lirics and 50 cent is his frend and dey are rilly good rappers  yeah.......   
 Big dissapointment! I should have read the reviews more carefully.. I bought this unit because it was recommended as accessory to the Sansumg 42" LCD I was purchasing from Amazon....It turns out this is a very limited mount if you plan to fix it to a dry wall. You cannot slide the bars horizontally and the center of the openings are 31" apart with a little leeway both sides... If the studs are 24" apart, like mine, forget it. What a bummer....Amazon should place a caveat next to its recommendation as accesory 
 This was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film I kept looking at my watch, the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about William Shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama. My girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but I wasn't in the mood she forced me to watch this, the film was about a struggling young writer Shakespeare played by Joseph Fiennes who falls in love with Lady Viola played by Gwyneth Paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play Romeo and Juliet, this film also won a couple of oscars including Gwyny for best actress but I felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old English style thats hard to understand. Overall the film was just O.K. I think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and Judi Dench was great as Queen Elizabeth but I never want to watch this film again, if your a Shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than I did. 
 Jennifer Cox, a travel journalist decided to travel around the world in search of her soul mate. After having survived a breakup, Jennifer felt that she couldn't find someone in English worthy enough to spend the rest of her life wife, she contacted some friends from all over the world to set her up with a date whom they felt would be a good match for her. Those friends also let the word out and soon, Jennifer found herself having many many dates set up. She travelled to Asia, Europe and the U.S. in search of her soul mate.   The premise of the book was promising enough but unfortunately, the book was lacking in substance. It was interesting enough to read about her first ten dates but soon, as a reader, I found myself getting quite dull by her description of dates. Initially, I thought this was a travelogue and that the author would have provided information about the culture or the places that she was going to. Unfortunately, it consisted mostly of her whirlwind dating. In addition, there were hardly any plots as it was mostly, she travelled to a particular place to meet someone, she did subsequently, and the next day, travelled to another country for another date. It was definitely not engaging at all. 
  Miniter takes advantage of the American ideological divide by cashing in with controversal editorials of hyperbole.   Maybe he could get together for a book with Ann Coulter 
 I dont think this CD is all that because I only liked 1 song, track 3, the rest of them are too deep for me, I'm an old school techno lover, so I will say if you like new age Techno, then you will love this CD!!! 
 Start reading Chapter 1 of this book for even just the first few pages, and for various topics, it will say to go to future Chapters.  If you take a look at those future chapters, there will be notes on the side telling you to go back to Chapter 1 or to other chapters.  You can run into infinite loops or dead ends not really picking up anything.  It is possible to maybe find what you were looking for, or find that the explanation for it is just not sufficient.  If I'm trying to look for a topic to remember, this book is not an easy read with the index either.  If you look up some topics in the index and go to all the pages listed, it may not list all the important pages.  Sometimes, when I had to look for information on something, say a "use case" for instance, then I'd look that topic up in the index.  I'd go to all the different pages listed in the index and it might not be what I was looking for.  Then I'd have to look at the side of the page of usually the lowest or 2nd lowest numbered page listed by the indexed topic, and go to the Chapter(s) listed.  When I went to those chapter(s) I'd still have to scour the entire chapter(s) until I might find what I was looking for.  An example was when I was trying to understand what one of the diagram types was, a "state diagram" I believe it was, as compared to say an "activity diagram."  Sometimes I would find out that things just weren't worded well if in there at all, and I'd have to refer to another UML book.  This book may have some good use, but I haven't found that yet.  It's hard to read and hard to look things up, and hard to learn from if you don't already know much or anything that is for sure 
 This book covers ALL cats in general, it's not specific enough for Persians. Dissappointing 
 Seriously read the title.  There are more spelling and grammar errors in this book than most netspeak blogs.  Also the way the author goes about speaking of the paranormal is laughable.  These kinds of people are what is hurting the field of paranormal research.  I bought this book and immediately sold it to a book reseller.  It was not worth the space it took up on my shelf 
 I thought I did enough research before buying this machine but apparently not enough. I was disappointed in 1. the design ( looks rather cheap) and 2. the performance. The coffee maker didn't stop dripping either water or coffee when you pulled out the pot and for the espresso part you need to REHEAT the unit 30 MINUTES prior to use!!! So much about being flexible about having an espresso! If you really enjoy good coffee you need to invest more, unfortunately. 
 The brugo mug is a hyped piece of junk. The 'tip and cool' feature on mine doesn't even work (when you select the 'tip & cool' setting on the dial, no coffee comes out at all - brilliant!). It works fine as a regular thermos-type thing, and it looks cool, but don't be fooled. Save yourself the shipping costs and high price of this faulty paperweight and get something from a local store or cafe. 
 I really had to work hard to finish this book.  It was a stuggle in the beginning to keep up with the characters and the plot, though by about 3/4 of the way through, it finally started to make sense.  It wasn't my favorite Ludlum book 
 DO NOT WATCH THIS GARBAGE! This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm honestly upset with the other reviewers here for misleading me so badly. This film is so bad, with so many problems I don't know where to even begin. I can only hope that someone on the verge of watching this changes their mind after reading this review. If I saved one person from buying/watching this disaster, then I have done my job. At the very least buy it from the used bin, that's where mine will be 
 I read this book prior to watching the movie.  The movie is now one of my favorites of all time.  This book however is one of the worst books I have read and I read a LOT.  I will say up front that at least part of my difficulty with this book is the slang.  What I mean is the author and character of the book are Irish, so perhaps I just couldn't pick up the language, and that may be my own shortcoming.  That being said, the main problem with this book is that it is all over the place.  The narrator will suddenly write three or four pages about some random people that we don't know, have never read about, and do not ever read about again.  The problem with that is that it makes you wonder what the point of those interactions and antecdotes are exactly.  That's just one example of the "messy" part I am referring to.  I found myself re-reading almost every other page wondering what I missed, trying to figure out where this and that came from.  I am not even sure why, but I never felt much for Patrick.  Although what he describes is awful and sad, I never really felt like I could identify with him and I never felt bonded with him like I would expect to.     Another problem in my opinion is that I don't feel that the character ever evolves or changes.  Patrick does go through a lot and experiences a lot of things, most of them hateful and disgusting (not on his part though) and he spends his time being upset over his mother who abandoned him yet I don't feel that there is ever any resolution or progression at all.  I got to the end of the book wondering what the point was, wondering if there was any point at all.  This book left me feeling pretty s****y about humanity, not that I need much to make me feel that way.    The ONLY thing that stopped me from giving Breakfast one star is the simple fact that an incredibly heartfelt and beautiful, even inspiring movie was born from this muddled piece of work.  The movie is "never" better than the book.  Well this is one of about three cases I know of where that is absolutely not true.  I never thought I'd say this about ANY movie adaptation of a book....SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND WATCH THE MOVIE INSTEAD.  
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 All this is the instructions and qualifications for how to get PHR or SPHR certified.  I did not find it helpful at all for the price!  It does give a practice quiz (yes, just one) which I suppose is helpful but I would just go ahead and order prep materials and use those.  If you are nervous about standardized tests then I guess it's somewhat helpful because it goes in to how to take them and alotting your time...but if you are well-seasoned in them or any testing (as I am) then I would say don't bother 
 A friend recommended this book which I unfortunately bought.  I feel sorry for people who think that this is "writing."  The author not only contradicts herself but the writing is shallow and lacks any depth.  If you want to feel good, buy yourself a bottle of wine, not this book 
 Despite having been a huge Who and Townshend fan for more than twenty years, I have never been able to listen to my LP copy of this album all the way through in one sitting. I finally bought a copy on CD for completion sake and gave it a whole listen. While it is better than I remembered, it is still a pretty mediocre affair.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the Scoop version of Don't Le go the Coat led to a new appreciation of this song. However, I prefer the Scoop version of that and You Better You Bet. Another Tricky Day is pretty good and Daily Records is an OK example of the kind of songwriting Pete was doing at this point (compare to Guitar and Pen on Who are You). I will be happy to never hear Cache Cache or How Can You Do It Alone again, however.   Finally, a correction to the review by Glenn Wall: John Entwistle, not Pete,  wrote Success Story from Who By Numbers. Still a great song 
 This movie was boring, it was like one of those sundance films, interesting enough to watch once, then put it away forever. The best part of the movie was Halle Berry's sex scene's they were brief, and tastfully done, however if it wasn't for her I never would have watched it. If I ever watch it again, it will be to get my Halle Berry fix......Keit 
 The nomenclature,  the terminology is Christian. But is the substance Christian ... or pre-Christian? This is the question I asked myself as I read this ultimately disappointing book.  A word about my own bias may serve to clarify. I traversed numerous esoteric and psychotherapeutic  paths, and for years was concerned with such ideas as `centering myself', spiritual discipline, meditation,  good will and so forth. Then I discovered Christianity, esoteric and exoteric - and found that it contained all of the above - and something altogether more: The tears of the heart.  The centering and discipline I had practiced  I now associate with all great religions - pre-Christian and otherwise. The tears of the heart were inaugurated with the pivotal moment Rudolf Steiner called The Mystery of Golgotha. My impression of Smoley's book is that it has a lot (of good things) to say about (pre Christian) spiritual discipline. And again, it says it with Christian terminology. But how much deeper than terminology, the depth of Christian tears penetrates Smoley's vision is hard for me to say. Like another reviewer,  I felt a certain degree of depth was lacking.   As an alternative to this book, I would recommend either Steiner's The Gospel of St John and its Relation to the other Gospels or Meditations on the Tarot by an anonymous author. Both are profound classics of esoteric Christianity. Steiner's heartbreakingly beautiful book is more for those who won't be thrown by mind-boggling cosmic anthroposophical panoramas,  the latter is arguably more grounded, more human and the most profound book of the twentieth  century.. 
 I ordered 3 original Canon Twin Packs (ASIN: B0001Z5YTG), and received 12 "compatible" cartridges. A fast service is useless if you can't get the right items to the customer. I complained via Amazon, and I am waiting for the seller's reply 
 I'd like to know what's going on at Harvard University Press . . . have they launched a series of high school texts without telling anyone? A friend of mine suggested that we read this book and I was shocked by how mediocre it is.  Readers who are seeking a clear, documented and science-focused discussion of the debate about Darwinism versus design should order Simon Conway Morris' LIFE'S SOLUTION (published by Cambridge University Press, incidently).  His notion of convergence is basically a proxy for the design argument without the metaphysical baggage.  I don't know if physicists are more or less religious than the general population, but at least physicists are aware of how uncannily orderly the universe is, however they believe it came about.  Conway Morris brings this pespective to biology, which has been hi-jacked long since by the anti-teleologist gang of Darwinian popularizers. Ruse is one of them, albeit in sheep's clothing.  The first two pages of Ruse's Introduction were so simple-minded and patronizing that I almost couldn't bear to read them, but I struggled on and was rewarded by an ascent to mediocrity in the rest of the Introduction.  The crucial flaw in Ruse's book is that it is basically a history of philosophy and religion, and Ruse is apparently incapable of getting any of his material straight.  You may question how a nice man like Ruse succeeded in annoying me to this degree, but my concerns are more serious than the level at which Ruse has pitched his rhetoric: he doesn't understand his subject. For a guy to address the rational, fact-based vs. speculative/faith (or irrational) way of looking at the universe without once mentioning Spinoza is to commit malpractice: "Deus sive Natura" ("God, that is, nature" meaning that God is not distinguishable from nature) is the most devastating blow ever struck to the religious conception that observable design in nature is an implicit proof for the existence of a creator.  And looking at the list of books he has either written or edited, Ruse has established a niche for himself as an expert on design and theology as it relates to evolution!  A wondeful example of the power of the evolutionary strategy of mimicry . . . !  When Ruse does discuss the science, he repeatedly delivers himself of his real position by hiding behind that intellectual fraud and bully Dawkins. For example, Ruse's comment "The only possible response to Dawkins, is that, Darwin or not, you feel compelled to accept that our understanding of nature, of living things, is changed and illuminated and made complete by your acceptance of the existence and creative power and sustaining nature of God" (page 331) is pathetic blather-and both condescending and presumptuous since he is putting words in the mouth of his hypothetical religious person. However, the passage confirms what is evident throughout DARWIN AND DESIGN--that Ruse merely plays "good cop" to Dawkins' and Dennett's "bad cop"-while sharing with Dawkins an agenda of extreme intolerance to religious claims for the existence of any form of value or meaning. Pages 331 - 333 are unpersuasive to a degree that is simply embarrassing, and pages 334 - 336 sink to a level of bathos and obsequiousness that it is a rare experience to behold.  But back to Ruse . . . the last chapter, Chapter 15 "Turning Back the Clock" is the most interesting in the book, but it demonstrates that Ruse brought a knife to an intellectual gunfight. Ruse had already confirmed this for me-at the absolute latest-on page 208 when he writes, "The fairest conclusion, therefore, is that, with respect to the question of progress, people are very much divided." How can the author of a book called Darwin and Design: Does Evolution have a Purpose? avoid taking a position on the question of progress?  To return to the opening sections of Darwin and Design, Ruse's pastiche of Leo Strauss's distinction between Athens and Jerusalem (beginning page 11) bleaches out most of the content that made Strauss's essay famous . . . and that is being as kind to Ruse as possible. In his version, when he turns from Athens to Jerusalem, he ignores Judaism with the breezy comment "As we leave Athens for Jerusalem, we must move the clock forward, past the birth of Jesus and into the Christian era" (Page 19)! This is astounding, given that (a) Jerusalem had ceased to exist, having been sacked and razed by the army of Titus, in the era to which Ruse is referring-which vitiates the original logic of the Athens:Jerusalem metaphor, and (b) it ignores the fact that Judaism is the inalienable root of Christianity, and most relevant Christian ideas associated with his subject make their first appearance in Judaism.  Psalm 8 is the origin of the theme that the observable design and order of nature makes it clear that a divine and beneficent God created the universe. Strangely, Ruse postpones any mention of these obvious sources of the theological side of the design argument until page 306, when he quotes a phrase from Psalm 19--much less engages in any meaningful way with the key representatives of the tradition.  Ruse's discussion of Augustine is laughable-Augustine was indeed "much taken with the philosophy of Plato" (Page 20) but Augustine spoke/read not one word of Greek so Plato's influence on him was quite indirect, and as a former Gnostic Augustine was all too aware of the danger of creating radical distinctions between the physical world and the world of values.  Not a word from Ruse about that, but Hans Jonas, a student of Heidegger who wrote the great The Gnostic Religion: The Message of the Alien God and the Beginnings of Christianity realized that 19th century scientific innovation was not the real reason for the era's attack on the idea of order and design in the physical universe. Jonas was a student of Heidegger, and he wrote his thesis on the Gnostics, which became the book The Gnostic Religion. Jonas was intimately familiar with the implications of Dawin on Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, and understood their impact on Heidegger. After having studied the Gnostics he asked this fundamental question:   Let us stop to ask what has here happened to the old idea of the cosmos as a divinely order whole. Certainly nothing remotely comparable to modern physical science was involved in the catastrophic devaluation and spiritual denudation of the universe. We need only observe that this universe became thoroughly demonized in the Gnostic period . . . . If not science and technology, what caused, for the human groups involved, the collapse of the cosmos piety of classical civilization, on which so much of the ethics was built?  His answer was a radical alienation that developed in late antiquity between the physical world and the world of values. Christianity, exemplified by Origen and Augustine, insisted on the synthesis between the physical world and the realm of values. This is the real story which should have been told in Ruse's first chapters.  For example, his quotations from Lucretius and Hume make a point very different than the one he is trying to make. The issue about chaos or design is ancient (which is obvious to anyone with a passing familiarity with the Western tradition), and hasn't really changed much; partisans of both sides have risen in almost every generation. The fact that Hume sounds Darwinian only shows that Darwin fit a metaphysical template over a set of physical facts to make a heuristic point every bit as speculative as any Church dogma.  In any case, a force just as powerful as the skepticism of Hume and Spinoza in the attack on design arose from the ethical critique of Voltaire, and it is the moral critique that is probably the more influential one. Ruse waits until his last chapter to address this point, which is revealing because Darwin's biography seems to indicate that the ethical argument was decisive on his views about the existence of a divine creator. Ruse also acknowledges at the end of his book that Dawkins has been deeply influenced by the ethical issue as well. Why does Ruse park the discussion of such an influential issue at the back of his book?  The moral or ethical critique is the issue about how a God powerful enough to create the universe could permit the unspeakable suffering evident everywhere. The publication of Candide in 1759 was a devastating indictment of design on these ethical grounds.  Indeed, the death of Darwin's daughter--ie his personal reaction to the problem of inexplicable suffering-seems to have been a major factor in Darwin's personal loss of religious faith. He also comments in his writings (I can't remember where) in relation to a particularly horrible parasitic relationship between host and parasite, that he couldn't imagine how anyone could be aware of it and believe in a good creator God.  These are theological views, not scientific views. As such, they are answerable with theological responses. Darwinists ignore the doctrine of the Fall in their theological speculations. The doctrine of the Fall teaches that Satan corrupted creation and triggered the introduction of diseases, the redefinition of the relations between animals into the relationship of predator and prey, and other calamities which distorted the original natural order of the physical world. Paul famously describes the effects of Satan's intervention in the natural world in his letter to the Romans:  For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now. (Chapter 8)  Of course, this is theology, but so are Darwin's (and Dawkins's) sweeping statements, and if Darwin and Dawkins were moved to speculate about God's motives, why should they ignore a 3,000 year old tradition that declares that the natural world is strongly influenced by the adversary of God?  But the metaphysical assertions of Darwinism are nothing new, they are merely the other side of an ancient tradition. Nor is it news that every living being who is born must die. What was innovative was Darwin's decision to focus on death and the killing process as the efficient causes of the world we see around us, indeed the secret mechanism for the development of living beings.  Jonas makes interesting points in his Phenomenon of Life about how Darwinism in effect makes death and killing the creative force itself, and by asserting that adaptations were mutations, Darwinism destroyed any sense of an "essence of being" in its traditional, noble meaning. As Darwin wrote, "Thus from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely the production of the higher animals, directly follows (Page 649)", and this vision is the heart of the challenge posed by Darwinism to traditional ethics.  Darwin's belief in death and killing as the underlying creative force in the natural world is the lodestar of Darwinism; everything else about the theory has changed and changed again since the publication of The Origin of Species, but the idea that evolution occurs as a result of adaptation through natural selection, with the elimination of beings with less-efficient adaptations, remains the key idea. I'm not sure whether science has confirmed that Darwin's Malthusian logic is true for the animal world (it turned out not to be true with respect to humans), but in any event Darwin's emphasis on death rather than on life is the most enduring aspect of his Weltanshaung:  All that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase in a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some season of the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction. When we reflect on this struggle we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (Page 106)  What is particularly sinister is the solace Darwin offers his reader in the last sentence. This is not science, this is a dark theology.  Why did I react at such length to a mediocrity like Ruse? Because Ruse is a committed partisan and popularizer of misleading ideas-and by this I don't refer to scientific ideas-that have already caused humanity much sorrow. He acknowledges that Darwinism is a theology of death and then basically advises his reader to accept it as fact and move on. Like the follower and the sheep that he is, Ruse heads right down the well-trodden path to disaster pioneered by his intellectual betters. His final comment is a perfect expression of his limitations and poor judgment:  "This is what makes it all meaningful to the believer. Not proof, but simply flooding, overwhelming experience that could not be denied. In Raven's words . . . 'Here is beauty-whatever the philosophies and art critics who have never looked at a moth may say-beauty that rejoices and humbles, beauty remote from all that is meant by words like random or purposelessness, utilitarian or materialistic, beauty in its impact and effects akin to the authentic encounter with God.'  I have nothing more to add. (Page 336)"  Indeed not--Nietzsche concluded that transcendent values did not exist, and that all existing religions and systems of meaning were an illusion. Where did he look to find meaning? He wrote in The Birth of Tragedy (I think): "The world can only be justified as an aesthetic phenomenon"--precisely the position arrived at by the stumblebum Ruse as he reflects on what meaning is left to him by Darwin's theology of death. 
 The battery function didn't work. Discovered poor battery wiring inside... I might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering. I'm not surprised by the crude construction from a $11 item. However, the hand grips themselves are worth the money. No more cramped hands 
 This book is full of quotes from different authors and lacks authenticity. The book does not prove solutions and elaborates on other authors quotes. I would recommend the works of Robert Anthony or David R. Hawkins for authenticity.  
 Some say everybody loves a mystery, but this book wasn't supposed to be one. It struck me as a buffoonish rant by an unbridled ego gone wild. The book's logic was so wildly disconnected as to leave me wondering exactly where the author was ultimately headed. The real mystery was whether or not someone could truly pontificate for two hundred pages without saying something of substance. The problem was that if there was any value in what was being said, it was masterfully disguised in a shroud of name-calling, racism, and non-sequitur. It was a pompous diatribe rooted in such shallow thinking that any reader with a hint of common sense runs aground long before arriving in port - wherever that was supposed to be.  In this work of art, all those who disagree are evil "liberals", even Bush! If the world were truly as black and white as this uneducated and vitriolic assault on the spirit of humanity, it might be a worthwhile read. However, you'd get more out of reading "The Chronicles of Pee Wee Herman". The book's greatest merit would be as a study guide in a seventh grade class on the fallacies of logical thought.  Newscasters are renown for having big voices, huge egos and pretty faces. Deep thought is not normally something associated with these "readers of the wire". This book presents no evidence to the contrary.  If there is to be another effort by Mr. Hayworth, I'd suggest more substance and less simple-minded name calling and chest pounding. If the rest of the world is as dumb as he paints it, we're all in trouble. He reminds me of the under-achieving student in the back of the class throwing tantrums to to call attention to himself. Try studying more and talking less. 
 Easy to see why this book didn't sell very well. Sorry, guys, but the kids in the Metallica t-shirts really did it. No, dem 'der hicks in Arkansas weren't just looking for innocent teenagers to execute 
 This wasn't a "book".  It was a few flimsy pages of very thin poor quality paper, tied together with a plastic ring.  It did nothing to help identify water fowl in flight.  Anyone can identify a duck once it is in hand.  This pamplet was a big disappointment.  A fair price for it would have been about $1 dollar, not $10 
 After seeing some of the other Amazon reviews of this movie, and the fact that Jason Swartzman was in it (after having seen him for the first time in "Rushmore" - a wonderful film), I had to purchase a copy of this DVD for myself to view.  It's got a wonderful cast of fine actors, but I found this movie really dumb.  One critic on the DVD box claimed this was "Laugh Out Loud Funny."  Really?  What movie was he watching?  I strained a chuckle here and there, but that was about it for me.  The Lily Tomlin & Dustin Hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script.  I know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie, but I didn't find much to snicker about.  
 this is basically a walkthrough but they dont tell you that i was dissapointed when i finally get it, but thats just me its up tu yo 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 The author has a great topic and a great question, and does a wonderful job of not providing any straightforward substantiation for her assertions. Part ofd the problem is perhaps that "Has feminism changed  science?" is not the question Schiebinger seems to be asking so much  as "have *women* changed science?"  By Jove, they have.  But is  this a new story?  Save your $27.95 for later...  this book offers little  that is edifying or even interesting 
 I love Beatrice Small's books but I can honestly say that this book is an exception. I felt that the heroine Rosemunde was a shallow character. She supposedly had this heart stopping love for Patrick Leslie and as soon as an osbstacle comes between the two, like loss of memory, she splits. Whatever, happened to that love that was going to last forever for Rosemunde, obviously she wasn't in love with Patrick Leslie that much. The guy she winds up finally marrying is a narcotic stalker. Definitely,not one of her better books 
 In "Iron John," Robert Bly announces that American men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness.  He illustrates his point with one of the Brothers Grimm's more obscure (and frankly less interesting) stories, interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point.  He also draws heavily on Freudian and Jungian theories.  He proves his point in the same way Freud and Jung proved theirs' i.e. by saying "This is what I see, I am the expert, so that makes it true, Occham's Razor be darned."  Bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions, nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or, heaven forbid, that his observations might be wrong.  For example, Bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 (conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion, despite his objective tone).  Bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true.  He does not consider that by age 35, most men have realized that they don't really want to be firemen.  Could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to (such as self-help books)?  Naw, it's gotta be that "dreams" thing.  Bly also describes a case where students during the Viet Nam war broke into their college presidents' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the CIA.  Bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures, because their fathers left home to work, preventing their sons from seeing how men work.  Bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger.  No, there had to be a "real" reason for the break-in, and aren't we lucky to have Robert Bly to tell us what it is?  Along the way, Bly overloads his writing with literary references, all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes.  It's all very pretentious, er uh, interesting, but so what?  I could interpret the same passages to mean something else.  If I lived at the time the passages were written, my interpretation would most likely be very different, despite Bly's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal.  Bly' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down, however.  It underscores what is wrong with his whole premise.  He tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact, but uses only subjective views (many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context) to support the idea.  Sorry Bob, you can't have it both ways.  One gets the impression that "Iron John" was cynically written to fill a niche.  Like all self-help books, "Iron John" targets a specific audience, tells them they are not happy, and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy.  Bly's target audience is White men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements.  If you do not need a political movement to define who you are, then "Iron John" is not for you 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 I wanted to order the puzzle sports mats but they do not tell you how many you get with your order.  I also tried the company web site and could not fine info there. 
 Very dissapointed in this outfit, looks really nice in pictures but is very cheaply made frayed the first time put on.  
 Watching the creation of the music on the DVD showed me why this left me cold.  It wasn't performed, rather it was assembled in the studio.  As such, its an exercise in high-tech recording techniques and currently-fashionable metal stylings.  The songs are disjointed in construction, and lacking the organic wholeness and grooviness required to make heavy music great.  I don't know how it was created, but Leviathan was a much more engaging listen 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 The prose of this novel is pleasurable to read at times.  Ward Just effectively conjures images of the 1950's culture of affluent suburbanites in Chicago.  But I couldn't really get into the characters.  There are moments where we begin to get to know a character, but then Just resorts to declarations like "I was never closer to my father than at that time" (I'm paraphrasing) instead of showing us how and why two characters were close.  A couple of pages of dialogue between them wasn't enough to make me feel they were close.   The dialogue rarely rings true; it feels like glossy pontifications, not something a real person would actually say.  It's rather cumbersome getting through it without quotation marks, too.  The other thing that undermined the believeability of this novel is that while the protagonist is only 19, his reflections and interpretations of things sound way too mature.  Perhaps this can be explained away by the fact that the novel is a reminicence of a much older man, but he claims to be having all these wonderfully deep insights at the time, not as he's writing his memories.  Overall, the book has nice moments, but it didn't move me.  I didn't believe that much of what the main character said and thought could be authentic.  I think Just is trying too hard to be ethereal but deep at the same time 
 Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.   For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.  It was definitly a waste of money.   
 There is no reason to wait any longer for a better transfer of this classic.  There was a Japanese laserdisc release fifteen years ago from a pristine film source; the intertitles were in Russian and Japanese (an interesting combination since the events of the film took place during the Russian-Japanese War of 1905).  The opening sequence of water rushing over a diversionary dam, and of the sailors on their cots, is simply astoundingly better than any transfer we have seen released in America on any format.  If the rumor is true of a 2004 digital remastering, we have waited three years too long for a quality DVD release.  A film this great needs to be seen in the best transfer for its reputation to be understood by all.  Eisenstein directed the details, and the better the transfer the more details will be seen.  None of current DVD transfers are at all acceptable 
 While I did appreciate the author's honesty and self-explorative approach to this book, I agree with the previous reviewer that this book went on way too long.  The author actually presents the same anecdotes in different  chapters and struggles with the same questions again and agin throughout  the text, with little movement forward.  Funny that the last section is  entitled "Time to Move On." because she doesn't seem to do that  very well. Unlike the previous reviewer, I don't recall anything in the  book that indicated that the author's weight is contributing to health  problems; in fact, my recollection is that she was able to ameliorate a  number of health problems through healthy eating and exercise without any  weight loss.  My sense was that she was attempting to demonstrate that we  talk about weight loss as a health necessity, when it is more often a  culturally mandated appearance issue.  My favorite line in the whole book  was a quote from columnist Ellen Goodman: "Show me a woman who only  wants to be thin for her health and I'll show you a man who buys Playboy  just to read the interview.&quot 
 ok.. I'm picking on Dave because I'm not a big fan of his voice... his voice sounds like Eddie Vedder gone way way way wrong....this is especially true with 'Rhyme and Reason'....   yes, I know Dave was born in South Africa but Paul McCartney was born in Liverpool and actually managed to sound American soulful... so what is it with Dave... I mean, he can sing in tune... and his band is really really good... I guess in the end... I'm just not a big fan of the finished product..  The albums starts out all right and 'What Would You Say' is a good song... but when some of the slower numbers come along like 'Rhyme and Reason', I just don't get it.. it doesn't sound good to me.. I mean, I listen to a lot of music and I can't understand how people get into this song... Dave's suicidal ranting and raving... his voice sounds like a wild beast... I'm not going to lie, this is just terrible material... 
 Contributors to this fine anthology of male authors would be far better served without the unnecessary and cloying tailpieces tacked onto their work by Author-Publisher Sarah Ban Breathnach. The jacket photo of foxy Sarah tells it all. The girl's gotta have the last word 
  Well Mr Whiting , I sure as hell can guess you did'nt like ''Georgie'' there was scarcely a page went by when when you didn't refer to GSP jnr's  sqeaky voice. I could'nt help but think through the book you were attacking his personality . Not one for Patton lovers 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.  
 I'm sorry but this album was a huge let down. I usually like beats from Dre, Storch, Just Blaze, Swiss Beats, ect but here the beats are just dull and the lyrics aren't any better. This is my first Busta album so I can't judge him as an rapper just from one album but this was just garbage. Maybe not the worst of the year but it just didn't work for me.  Thumbs dow 
 Okay, I was excited to see this movie.  I read a few non fiction books on the dot.com bust and thought I knew a thing or two, but when I watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more, I found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from.  I mean, WHO cares about these people's relationships??  NOT ANYONE WHO IS WATCHING THIS MOVIE!  We care about why and how businesses succeed and fail.  This movie sucked 
 I am extremely disappointed in "The Inside Ring" by Mike Lawson.  Injecting his personal political views into the book as a way of adding current events into a fiction book has made this unreadable.  I did not select his book to read his political views.   Here are some references that I believe are linked to current administration.   Page 21 - Reference to Dixie Chicks Page 28 - Reference to the "invisible weapons of mass destruction 
 I love Daniel Stell books but this one was horible.I have to admit I didn't finsh it but I got tired of how her husband treated her and she did nothing about it.But from what I've read from other readers I didn't miss much by not finshing it 
 i had given this a second star, but then i thought to myself: why? this movie is abominable. its not just the amateurish performance by joaquin phoenix as johnny cash -- i never thought anyone could sing flatter than the REAL cash -- or the squeaking by reese witherspoon as june carter. its the whole damned show! how often have you ever seen a musical when the songs actually STOPPED the action (i can only think of richard attenboroughs dreadful interpretation of "a chorus line")? but the REAL villain here is james mangold, the director who previously gave us that alltime classic "girl interrupted". its bad enough that hacks are given millions of dollars to make movies, but i urge you to listen to this guys commentary on the dvd; he is a pretentious jerk who honestly believes he has made a significant work of art. at least the hacks in old hollywood knew they were hacks and were willing to work within their weaknesses, thus often turning out fine professional work. this guy mangold is a moron -- the technique of a buffoon and the limited talent of an ed wood (without the freak show imagination). i cut this down from 2 stars to 1 because i resent that i gave up a few hours of my life to watch this stupid unprofessional ugly movie! 
 I bought this book solely because of the reviews below. Having read as much of the book as I can stomach, I must ask these reviewers, "What have you been smoking, dudes?!"  This book is a slap in the face to all the authors who came before and is harmful to any reader who expects the truth and nothing but the truth. Hollywood is famous for its fictionalized accounts of historical figures, but I don't like reading flights of fancy in a supposed non-fiction book.  For the past 35 years, I've read every book I could get my hands on about the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and music recording and production. And I've got lots of experience in the recording studio, much with my own bands. Reading some of the B.S. this author wrote made me (several times) throw the book down in disgust. For example, the author's explanation of "vocal doubling" and ADT in the George Martin section is embarrassingly wrong -- to the point of being hilarious, if not painful. It's quite apparent he has never sang any tracks and doesn't have a clue what doubling is, because he sure got in way over his head. Probably has never set foot in a studio. But he pretends to be an authority.  Another example out of many fallacies: In the Brian Wilson section, he claims Brian's deafness in one ear is the result of Brian's father whacking him with a 2x4. Where did he get this story? All the books I've read on the Beach Boys merely SUGGEST that Brian's deafness MAY be attributed to his father boxing his ears many times as a child.  This being a book about producers, the author tends to write the chapters as if the hits were all because of the producer. As if "Jumping Jack Flash" was great solely because of Jimmy Miller -- like the Stones just happened to be there when Miller created the hit. Yeh, right. And in one chapter about a guitarist who used lots of feedback, the author claims how the producer "heaped on the feedback". Sheesh! Every guitarist knows the feedback comes from the guitar amp, not some knob in the control room.  If all these errors and misinformation weren't enough, the author also writes in a florid, verbose style. He likes big words, some of which he doesn't understand, because he uses them wrong.  I'm something of a bookaholic, with a couple thousand books in my collection, and I've read every one all the way through -- some 3 or 4 times. This is the first book in my life I was unable to finish, the first book I ever threw in the garbage. If this book can be published, then you and I can be writers, too. All we need to do is make up stuff about famous people.  I hope this review saved you some money. Amazon offers many fine books about the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and recording and producing popular music. But this isn't one of them 
 Presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a Prince album or two but don't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection. The way this is laid out though is confusing at best: Disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable. ("My Name is Prince"? His take on "Nothing Compares 2 U" when Sinead O'Connor's is definitive?) Disc 2 compiles 12" mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e. for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat His Purpleness every records.  BOTTOM LINE: This is haphazardly thrown together. Middle range fans are better off with THE HITS/THE B-SIDES which compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material (some of which equals his singles) 
 I cant find any place in the book where the author teaches you how to think. If the book were about, say...sex...Maxwell never gets around to teaching any practical techniques for better sex. The book is all about attitude and setting....which might make sex or thinking or whatever more enjoyable, but still fails to deliver the goods about how to do "it." The book is an infomercial about thinking. Like the one's that promise to teach you how to make a fortune playing the stock market but never quite get to the part where you learn how to do "it." The infomercial is all anecdotes and quotes, like this book. And that's okay because Maxwell uses good material.   Much of what Maxwell asserts I agree with. Amen! Candy and dinner and flowers and liquor are terrific for the right mood. Plus proximity...you need to be there! But no where does Maxwell instruct you how to score. How to get from the right friends and the right place and the right time etc, etc., etc. to "Eureka!"  But in fairness to Maxwell, I dont believe you can teach anyone to think any more than you can command a feeling or mood or orgasm to materialize. I dont believe thinking and emotions etc. are THAT auto-manipulative. I mean, some very creative people swear by drugs and booze 
 (...). You're better off going for Lonely Planet or Let's Go or the Berkeley Guide. This guide is terrible. I was so disappointed especially after how good their Time Out Guide to Cape Town is. I expected it to be just as good. It makes it seem like Dublin is boring. Go buy another guide. I wish we had an option to give negative stars 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 A little wordy.  Suggsted for serious work not for casual reader 
 This book has two key faults:  the author's unobjective/uncritical assessment of her subject and an asleep-at-the-wheel editor.  Carmel Snow seems to have been a fascinating and complex character, but the author's apparent idol/family-worship prevented her from viewing Mrs. Snow critically.  That ultimately makes the Mrs. Snow presented in this book a one-dimensional character - "Aunt Carmel who worked like a man, didn't have much time for her family, etc."  It would have been interesting to know, for example, why Bazaar's circulation numbers often didn't equal Vogue's, for all of the paeans to Mrs. Snow's editorial genius.  What were the real, business reasons for the housecleaning at Bazaar after Mr. Hearst died?  Mrs. Snow's alcoholism was almost entirely avoided until the very end, when it was presented as "Mrs. Snow liked to have several cocktails at lunch" and then noted only as the cause of a highly embarrassing social moment.  Alcoholism doesn't happen overnight, as it seems to in this book, and it would have been interested to know what effect it had on her work.  The book also suffers from the want of a good editor who could have eliminated the author's juvenile asides to the reader, e.g. "how to put it", "Pace, Nigella Lawson" etc.  
 This book is awful.  It doesn't discuss the issues of Configuration management, it isn't a how-to book.  It is a collection of disjoint material and results that would appeal to no one, or at least I have no idea who the target audience is.  I bought this online and would not have purchased it at all if I had flipped through the pages in a bookstore first 
 Outdated and poorly written, I found this book to be a big disappointment. Many topics relating to the professional esthetician were not thoroughly covered or were not covered at all. In many instances, the author was incorrect in the scientific aspects of the book. Many things were not fully explained. It seemed as if the author wrote the bare minimum in order to complete a book. The only skin care discussed was a facial. This is a basic skill taught in cosmetology school. Check out Milady's Standard Textbook for Professional Estheticians instead. I found it to be a much better text 
 Read Corso's The Day After Roswell and also Jim Marrs Alien Agenda after this one.  This reads like disinformation from the 50's. For those who wish it to all go away and to not have to think any longer, this is your book folks.   Just another voice who asks you not to look behind the curtain is all.  Writing style was not all that great either 
 "Longwinded.  Tedious. Impossible to finish (there was a reason Flaubert never finished this either) 
 I am a little over halfway through the book and I doubt I will finish because it just can't hold my interest (and I am very interested in the subject).  It reads like a technical college text and is definately not a fun book.  After reading what I have I haven't picked up one useful real-world exercise to try and it contains less info about body language than other good books like Body Language Secrets or Undercover Sex Signals.  I have Superflirt on order and am hoping it has more real-world useful information and advice 
 this book was very disappointing, it is a very limited point of view written for a committed male/female couple and no one else, also only talks about "domestic discpline" not really about the BDSM mindset.  I really didn't learn a thing from this about truely creating a scene and understanding your sub 
 TALKING ABOUT A MISSCAST. SAMUEL JACKSON CAN PORTRAY A HITMAN, A PIMP OR A THIEF, BUT A PHARMACOLOGICAL GENIUS, YEAH, RIGHT 
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 Unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded.  Save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  By the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read English very well or are shills for McKinsey 
      This movie could not be pulled off even with Audrey Hepburn. I am an ardent Audrey Hepburn fan but, the script was terrible and so was some of the acting. I hate to say it but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have not read the book but, from what I have heard the movie does not do the book justice. By the end of the movie I was actually glad it was over unlike many of Hepburn's other movies. I only gave it 2 stars because it is a Audrey Hepburn film. 
  The book doesn't go into enough depth nor does it  expand on problem solving 
 I must admit. I am not Kings biggest fan. I like the way he writes characters, but for years, I haven't been able to put my finger on why I don't like his books. After reading The Colorado Kid, I realized what it was. King is a lazy writer. He can tell a good story, but he doesn't follow through. His typical way out of a jamb is to make some inanimate object talk. Bleh. You can tell when he is done with a story. It just ends.  This book is no exception. The story rambles through the mouth of a clichï¿½d old time reporter teaching a young'un the ropes. King tells the story, he doesn't show it. I kept waiting for the narrative to stop and for the action to begin, but it never did.  And the ending! Someone, his editor, agent, family or friends, tell Mr. King that mysteries are supposed to be resolved. He doesn't resolve this mystery. That was the only reason, other than the fact that I had a 7 hour flight and nothing else to do, that kept me reading. I got to the end and I swear I almost tossed the book while on the plane. There is an after word trying to justify his ending. I didn't get past the first sentence. Authors don't write justifications for their books unless they know they are guilty of something.  If I could take away all the stars on this book, I would. Even one star is one too many. 
 While I do love this movie, and the songs from it, this CD is a sad example of a missed opportunity. This CD was released a few years ago with dialogue in-between the songs. Its now more like the original LP from 1968, but far from complete. If they truly wanted to release a great "Special Edition" soundtrack, they should have included the fantastic score by Irwin Kostal/Sherman Bros. I have heard the "isolated score", and in some ways it is better than some of the songs. Maybe they will get it right for the 70th Anniversary 
 In "Government Gay" (1997), the first book in Fred Hunter's Alex Reynolds mystery series, Alex's lover Peter is kidnapped.  In Chapter 15 of that novel, Alex finally rescues Peter from a locked hotel room by using his VISA card to pop the lock on a door off which the numbers had fallen, leaving only the shadows of said numbers on the grimy door.  Alex explains to his readers that he had learned this simple break-in technique from a neighbor.  In Chapter 12 of "National Nancys" (2000), the fourth book in the series, Alex is again trying to break into a hotel room, this time using bobby pins, when Peter suggests, "Why don't you try a credit card?"  Alex looks up at him, and says, "What?"  And Peter then proceeds to explain to Alex how the technique works.  Alex whips out his VISA card, but is unable to make the "new" trick work, leaving Peter to demonstrate how to pop the lock successfully.  Uh ... hello!  Wake up, Mr. Author!  Oh!  And did I mention that in this novel - too - the room number is able to be identified only because there were shadows left on the dirty door where the numbers used to hang?  It's this kind of sloppy, repetitive, and extremely formulaic writing that makes the Alex Reynolds series so incredibly tired.  Apparently author Hunter was so disinterested in the books that he didn't bother to worry about repeating himself after only four plots!  And sure enough, there is little about "National Nancys" to distinguish it from its previous three cookie-cutter predecessors.  Insist on trying out this series?  Pick one title, any title, and borrow it from the library.  Now you know exactly what happens in each of the first four novels! Alex, Peter, and Alex's mom get involved with murder; withhold evidence from the authorities; are warned by those same authorities to stop investigating; ignore the advice; barely escape death; wrap up the case.  Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z .. 
 This woman sounds like she was very bitter about the entire experience. Quite honestly, it's people like her who contribute to the many problems of the greek system in general by not speaking up when these things are going  on. I will admit that she did offer some solutions. My undergrad greek  experience was nothing like what she described but  these can vary from  campus to campus. One thing I really didn't like is that she gave away  which house she belonged to. If she wanted the readers to know which  sorority she belonged to, she should have just said so and not use examples  of hazing rituals for us to figure it out. I suggest if you want to read  this book, borrow it from your local library and don't waste your money 
 I really wanted to like this.  I love Paul Auster's 'New York Trilogy' and Mark Haddon's 'Curious Incident' and was expecting similar mind games.  But  'Remainder' didn't work for me, I'm  afraid.  The writing feels forced and maddeningly artificial.  The dialogue is plain bad.  The  sluggish pace means you're always a few steps ahead of the narrator.  Which is never a good  place to be.  A disappointment, sorry.  
 I'm in the process of confirming the rumour that Rod was being seriously considered for a knighthood until the royal family was accidently subjected to listening to this CD.The rest,as they say,is history. Let's get serious, Every performer of Rod's stature has the right to dress up and sing like a lounge lizard once and awhile. But like every good joke you only have to tell it to the audience once, not three times and counting.The only group that applauded the release of this CD were chronic insomniacs. Rod needs to emerge from the "counting room" of his Graceland mansion in St.Tropeze and get serious about the music instead of the bottom line. Forecasts are not promising. The music industry is abuzz, that his next project under consideration is a tribute album to the legendary Harry Reser and the Clicquot Club Eskimos orchestra. It's being leaked on the web,that through the state of the studio art, Harry's instrumental tracks are being combined with newly created lyrics for many of his best selling tunes. The standouts include,"The Old Town Pump" and"Send Me Back My Honeyman".I have serious reservations concerning the project's success, particularly given the weak performances represented on the American Songbook Vol.3. However,hope springs eternal. 
 I thought this was a pretty bitter screed that was more about her life and self-absorbed (as well as self-indulgent) negativity than Julia Child or food. I was also embarrassed for this woman's husband, whose dirty laundry was aired in a book ostensibly about cooking. I was really disappointed with the whining. 
 Well this has to be a classic, but describing it as a new 2001 novella by Delillo is a sure way to rile Delillo fans like me, who almost ordered it on reflex.  It turns out to be the first part of Underworld.  While Underworld is, in my view, one of the great books of this decade, the publisher should at least warn potential buyers that they may already own this book.  On the other hand for those who find it hard to stick through an 800 page book, this sample delicacy might be a good introduction to the art of Delillo.  As for me I prefer the original Underworld,  or Body Artist, a completely mesmerizing novella about the same size as Pafko 
 This was one of the worst books I have ever read.  The language and content was awful!  If you are planning on buying it,please, don't.  I usually try to stay open-minded about books I read, but this was awful 
 I needed to purchase this book for my graduate class in biochemistry.  I found it to be NOT user friendly in the least.  Most books I have used for biochemistry come with a great set of definitions.  This book not only doesn't come with an appendix with definitions but doesn't explicitely define words in the text.  I finally found the "definitions" appendix at the only website (how nice of them...and how cheap can you get.  Most books if they have a website also have definitions in the back).   I should also mention it does not have a thorough index.  Major subjects are neither defined nor shown in the index.  Several times I had to go to either my organic chem book (Morrison & Boyd...great book), the Lippencotes (spelling) biochemistry review text (also a great concise book), or my under graduate biochemistry book (and study guide.  Garrett and Grisham) to find information due to either the lack of information in this book or difficulty in finding it. Also, the layout of the book is terrible.  Although proteins are now THE significant phase of biochemistry, the introduction of DNA and mRNA in later portions of the book is rediculous.  If you follow the basic flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to Protein it is much more easily understood.  Throwing in the flow of genetic information at chapter 5 and later in chapter 27 discussing DNA replication, RNA synthesis and splicing (ch 28) and protein production (ch 29) makes no sense whatsoever.  The order is correct but to place this information at the back of the book when it is necessary to understand some of the basic systems of the cell is rediculous.  It is like learning all the organic chemistry reactions without understanding the basics and reasoning behind organic chemistry. 
 This is simply a disjointed journal of a series of short hikes with portions deteriorating to a lame account of car camping. This ranks as one of the worst books ever published. Don't waste your time 
 This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.  I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies.  They are either worse than this one (rare) or better than this one. As an example: Buffalo '66 is worse.  If you watch both in the same day, you will surely die 
 This book covers a facinating and underexamined area of US history.  I was very much looking forward to reading it.  The author clearly is extremely well-educated on this subject.  The problem is -- he's boring.  Ward Churchill writes like your typical college professor who turned you off history forever by being pedantic and uninspiring.  I've worked as a book editor in the past and I have found that often the more education a writer has the worse his or her books are.  Churchill seems to be underlining his scholarship with tediousness and seems to be over his head in information with no way to convey it in an  readable manner.  His editor should be fired for not making this book comprehensible to a wider audience.  It isn't a doctoral thesis, for crying out loud.  It's a disappointing treatment of what should have been an enlightening and educating experience. I wish I'd saved my money and hope, considering all the books Churchill has listed on Amazon, that he has, or will, learn to write well 
 There really should be a disclaimer on the back of this book; the description given doesn't prepare the reader for the incessant preaching.  What could have been a decent mystery is totally ruined by the insertion of religion in nearly every sentence. If Ms. Blackstock wants her books to reach a wider audience then she needs to tone it down a lot.  If she's satisfied with "preaching to the choir" then she's done the job well because these books will never be successful out in the real world 
 I was so anxious to read this after waiting so long for the 2nd book.  I loved White Oleander.  This book is psychotic and not much of a story.  Very disappointing from a talented author 
 The book was ok, but with all the information at our fingertips on the web and also knowing some things about the heart and other conditions, I felt like I wasted my money except for the diet part of the book.  He didn't really list anything that I didn't already know and he didn't give any symptoms, except for tests.  I guess you have to go by that, but I just felt let down by the book.  I wanted more from it.  I know about the chambers of the heart and techniques used to treat heart problems.  I just felt all of that could have been left out.  I want to know more about the disease and how they came across it and how people's lives are doing now with the diet and things like that.   I just felt like he was a doctor giving advice, but it lacked that punch that keeps you wanting to know more.  He didn't give a good review on meds and he just didn't sound like a good writer.  I felt like he was saying the same thing over and over at times and he just didn't need to explain all the stuff about the heart and how we burn calories and stuff like that.  It just seemed redundant.  Some people may want to know all of that stuff or they may already know it.  I just felt like I was reading a boring book that had things in there that were of not any use to me.  I hope I'm not being to harsh, but I just was so let down 
 When Dickens was good, he was very very good.  When he was bad, he was wordy and sappy and boring.  Did you ever wonder why you never heard of the three stories in this book?  Because they're so unremarkable!  The title story is the best; i.e. it's the only one that's even readable.  Do yourself a favor, don't read this boo 
 As is generally the case, Dr. Laura directs her criticism/suggestions directly at her readers/listeners: "get your own act together and your life will fall into place."  There is, of course, a lot of wisdom in this.  Before making a laundry list of complaints about how other people are letting you down in your life, you probably should examine your own shortcomings.  This can definitely help put things into perspective (i.e., "yes my husband is insensitive and aloof, but maybe my constantly criticizing him isn't helping").  Dr. Laura goes on to give some decent advice on how women can improve their marriages: be friendly and cheerful with your hubby rather than bitchy and resentful, don't let yourself go to pot (keep your weight down and dress nicely), don't withhold sex.  Yes, your spouse will probably will be in a better mood if you are cheerful, look nice and eagerly welcome his sexual advances.  According to "the doctor" men are "simple creatures" (give them food and sex and they are happy), it's women who are chronically dissatisfied, constantly complaining and impossible to please.  She claims that the situation is made worse by the feminists who are always telling women falsehoods like: "men oppress women," "women who are housewives are unhappy," "women should seek, and expect sexual equality with men."  Of course, Dr. Laura isn't very clear about who "these feminists" are and she talks about "women's magazines" as if they were the voice of  "the feminists," even though most feminists would probably argue that magazines like Cosmo are more part of the problem than the solution.  There are a lot of women who call themselves feminists and very few see eye to eye on all issues.  However, I think most would agree that feminism is about giving women the opportunity to realize themselves in whatever capacity they choose.  This can mean as a wife and mother, as a professional or as both.  There may be feminists who look down on women who've chosen to be housewives, but there are at least just as many "feminist haters" who impugn women who have sacrificed motherhood in order to pursue dreams that were more important to them.  What's the difference?  Both are guilty of criticizing women who make choices different from their own in order to feel better about their own decisions.  Dr. Laura clearly errs is in her assertion that all women are happier being wives and stay-at-home moms and having a husband who provides for the family.  If this were the case, why did the 1950's (the epitome of traditional family-life) bring on the feminist movement in the first place?  Rather than becoming addicted to Valium or clamoring for more equality, why weren't women simply singing the praises of their wonderfully fulfilling domestic lives?  I think the answer is clear: a lot of women were extremely bored and unfulfilled without the intellectual and social stimulation that a life outside the home can provide.  Also, being economically dependent on another person puts you in a very vulnerable position if you are in a physically and/or emotionally abusive relationship.  It is very true that women today who are juggling careers and family are feeling their own dissatisfactions: they are overworked and feel robbed of time with their families and they feel like the do a disproportionate share of the work in the home. However, I don't think the answer lies in sending ALL women back to the traditional role of housewife.  At least now women have options.  If they decide staying at home and caring for children is the #1 priority in their lives, or that they simply cannot "do it all," then everyone should respect their decision.  If they prefer to juggle work and family or remain childless and free to pursue other ambitions, those are also decisions that should be respected.   Life is complicated and there are no one-size-fits-all answers to life's most important choices.  Dr. Laura tries to support her claim that ALL women REALLY WANT to be stay-at-home moms and cared for by a man with some study that "demonstrates" that partners in marriages that don't follow these traditional roles have higher rates of heart disease.  Rubbish!  You can always dig up some obsolete study to prove any argument you are trying to make.  There are A LOT MORE studies that show that single women are happier than married women (I'm not saying this so, I'm just saying that such studies say nothing about whether or not YOU will be happy in any given situation).  Particularly offensive is what Dr. Laura says about sex.  Essentially she argues that it is women's duty to provide their husbands with sex whenever they want it.  I agree that discrepancies in desire can be a problem in a marriage and that women should not make a habit of casually dismissing their husbands' sexual attentions.  However, there are "reasons" why many women are not as interested in sex as their husbands, the biggest one being that they are not getting the kind of sexual stimulation they need in the bedroom.  But, "the doctor" makes no mention of this.  She advices women to service their husbands and act like they are loving it ("men like to think that they are good lovers").  What about a little more communication?  What about telling your partner what you like?  What about some compromise?  No, according to the Dr. Laura, sex is what you give your husband in exchange for his ultimate sacrifice: his marrying you.  She even goes so far as to remind women that in some states we are legally obliged to do so (does she want to put women who don't behind bars?).  I guess on this issue I am "idealistic": sex should be something that is mutually satisfying for both men and women.  Life is probably more complicated for the modern woman, but this does not mean that it is worse.  In fact, I would argue that women have it better now than they have at any time in history.  Turning back the clock to a "simpler time" may seem like an appealing solution to today's overworked and highly-stressed women, but I sincerely doubt that it would provide any lasting satisfaction in most women's lives.  Women, as individuals, must decide for themselves what lifestyle is most gratifying.  The path Dr. Laura suggests is only one of many that "can" lead to a healthy, rewarding life 
 Other current pop-rappers like Jibbs or Unk that have one or two hits usually have a consistent album behind them.  At least that's what I thought.  I can't say the same for Mims.  With his long-winded intro about music saving his life, you start to wonder if Mims is trying to appeal to your heart or your ear.  Pretty soon you find that it's not really either.  Many of the songs are too soft compared to the hit, lacking even big bass that makes for an enjoyable car ride.  Savior self, skip Mims 
 I love Sidney Sheldon's books, but I was quite disappointed with this one.  I can't believe it got such good reviews.  The story was fast-paced, interesting, and well written.  However, the ending was awful and frustrating.  It was too abrupt and too many things happened at once, it didn't resolve well.  It was also too much of a let down.  There are definitely better Sidney Sheldon books than this one 
 I really like the Rosetta Stone product (although it is over priced).  WARNING: Rosetta Stone (Fairfield Language Technologies) will NOT replace a CD if it is lost, stolen or damaged unless you bought the product DIRECTLY from them (and then they charge you $30 for a replacement CD).  I had the misfortune of purchasing from a local bookstore and someone had stolen the disk from inside the package.  In this case I can get my money back from the store I bought it from but since you can't backup the disks you had better be VERY careful to not lose one 
 Thought I'd try this tea.  Wrong choice.  Tea is not as good as Numi's Iron Goddess of Mercy Oolong tea.  Perhaps my favorite Oolong. Shipping costs almost as much as the tea on the Natural Chinese Wuyi Oolong.  I'll stay with Numi Tea from now on 
 I was one of many birth-mothers who received a copy of this book when considering open adoption. It seemed to be written for the adoptive perents to persuade them into open adption. The Open Adoption Experiance and The Other Mother are much better choices for birthmothers, and really give them the information they would need to make an informed choice 
 I usually would briefly summarize the plot in my reviews, but there really isn't one to write about.  It feels like a "days of our lives" soap opera of Betsy's life...she and eric are in love, she and eric have a fight, then she and eric make up, re-wash and rinse.  I wouldn't mind this as much except Betsy is getting more annoying with each book.  I keep waiting for her to grow up and be more queenly.  Her though process is like a 13 year old, and I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up.  I feel like the author is making Betsy more immature so that she can put Betsy in sillier situations (that anyone with a brain can figure out in 2 minutes) to get a cheap laugh from the readers.  This is one book in the series that you can skip without loosing anything.  To be honest, I truly think Betsy's demon sister is a better character to read about.  Maybe the author could do that after Betsy's story fizzles out...like the next book.      
 For decades, many male professors have made the same excuses for sexual exploitation of their students--to the fury of feminists.  To read a feminist using the same rationalizations is both nauseating and infuriating 
 The title says it all. Reguardless of why Dave left, these "episodes" -- if you even want to call them that, should have stayed lost. But because of Dave going MIA and seeing as how Viacom  wants to cash in on the popularity, they released not even subpar material. If I was Rick James, I would be spinning in my grave.. 
 Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal ("Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness") or precious ("Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound"); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs 
 The author cannot seem to grasp that there is much discontent amongst the people. She swallows the Islamic doublespeak about women's rights but I'm sure she wouldn't tolerate one tenth of what Iranian women must endure. Also she is fixated on being a blonde in Iran. Weird 
 We Can Build You is one of PKD's weakest books. It starts in a quite interesting way, but ultimately leads nowhere. The best ideas are discarded and the end of the book concentrates in the lead character's descend into schizophrenia - and even that is not interesting in any way (unlike in some other Dick's books). Recommended only for Philip K. Dick completists 
 George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys.  This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be.  However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then.   In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did.  By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way better than the main feature. 
 I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, "hey, they're cheap, isn't all shearling good?" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy.  They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I'm a size 7, and the 8's were a little small for my feet. 
 I'm giving up on this book.  It reads like a first draft.  Sentences like the following on page 71 abound: "When you hear not so often as you wish, remember, our silence means our safety," the Committee of Secret Correspondence  - now doing business as the Committee for Foreign Affairs, although Franklin, who had never mastered the original name, was not to know for months - soothed the envoys, whom they understood to be starved for news.      Schiff needed a good editor but didn't get one.  This certainly isn't Pulitzer grade material.  I wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth.      Van Doren in his biography gives a better account of Franklin's years in Paris. 
 All of his books are based on lies. He states he is writing from his personal Native American experience, but he forgot to tell people HE IS A FAKE INDIAN.      I am a Native American and most of the Native American community from the 2 largest Native American newspapers Indian Country Today and News From Indian Country and International AIM know this fake wannabee is fraud and a phony.      He lied on his resume to steal a job set aside for a Native American professor. He has never faced the same discrimination as real Native Americans. He is a Cultural "Identity Thief" for his own greed and ego.       He has no shame profiting off of American Indians. He makes over $100,000 a year off a "playing" Indian. Some Anti-capitalist phony? Why take those "Eichmans" money, unless you're a hypocrite. We all know you're a big phony.      IF HE LIED ABOUT HIS NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE, THEN HOW CAN ANY OF HIS WORKS HAVE ANY CREDIBILITY?      In fact the so-called ancestor he claims "Indian" from was actually an INDIAN KILLER and killed Creek Indians in a story by the RockyMountain News, one of the largest papers in Colorado. The same tribe Churchill said he originally was from.       DON'T BUY BOOKS FROM A LIAR. BUY BOOKS WRITTEN BY REAL NATIVE AMERICANS.       If he had any honor he would step down and GIVE THE JOB TO REAL NATIVE AMERICAN and stop using the guise of American Indian to enrich himself. He is a cultural identity thief for his own agenda, big bucks and EGO. 
 This book was extremely dry. The subjects brought up in the book had no real applications and was only pleasing to those whose fun time is filled with boundry layer equations and diffusion of dilute gases in my butt 
 I hate to be that curmudgeonly reviewer, but I have to say, this album simply isn't good. I have a rather eclectic and flexible taste in music, and I tend not to think worse of music that's far outside the genre borders of stuff I enjoy.  This is within those borders. It's not good. I got this album on advice that it was similar to other good sadcore singer/songwriters I love - Elliott Smith, Red House Painters, Nick Drake, Jose Gonzalez. It IS square in the middle of the 'indie' genre. It is NOT Elliott Smith or Nick Drake.  The songs are plodding and repetitive, the instrument playing is harsh, clumsy and unrefined, and for as broad a variety of vocalists that I think are great, or at least enjoyable, this fellow seems to have troulbe hitting the notes and even more trouble holding them. This is something akin to Ben Folds, minus skill on the piano, vocals... or, musical talent in general. The second track, "Little Lords", is the closest to enjoyable listening. Decent strumming on the guitar. Then it repeats, the vocals get a little wobbly, and it repeats, the vocals fly off the tracks, and finally, goes nowhere. The 1 star is just for the first 20 seconds or so of this track. And because zero stars isn't an option.  I see that other folks like this music so I'll finally assert that it's "not for everybody". But approach with caution. I think many folks who like awesome riffs, excellent vocals and great guitar will want to feed this CD to the dog 
 My girlfriend had this CD and played it for me.  I really like country music and I like some of Reba's music for this CD was way too "far out" for me!!  Some reviews here have mentioned that its too loud and overdone.  I have to agree.  I don't think much of the songs on this collection.  If you're going to buy a Reba CD I would buy her first greatest hits collection.  That's a good example of country music without Reba overdoing the vowels and syllables to her words.  Give me a break!! 
 I did not count, but it did not seem as though I read 201 answers, but fewer. In many years of working and interviewing, more lately than formerly, I encountered perhaps 3 of the questions.  In today's market, it seems interviewers are looking for evidence of directly applicable and detailed skills, especially technical and hard ones, for comfort with the candidate, for evidence of being quick, adapting well, and for initiative and solid achievement.  The questions are mildly contrived, and I have not been asked more than about 3 at any time in my longish career. Possibly because he covers so many which are illegal or too personally probing in this litigous era 
 Albeit you'll learn many things about Area 7 & 8. Although you'll learn about chemical  and nuke weapons, this book's really boring. Each chapter begins with a persecution. So, how many persecutions could you read in a book? How many times the book's hero can save himself or being save by other person? At half book when you're still reading persecutions, you'll know that Schofield and Gant will survive. About the inexistent love story that of course is pathetic I won't write more. So if you like my kind of books (check my listmania! list) don't read this one 
 Yes, I bought this enormous dollhouse- I saw the low price, and thought "how cool" : the dollhouse I never had growing up.  Reviewers are right- it's total junk. It's made mostly of particle board, and apparently cheap particle board at that.  You really can't move it, as folks said, it starts to come apart.  So, I would suggest looking elsewhere- I think Hearthsong might have a nice wooden dollhous 
 I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally,  after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and  suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option 
 I returned this biofeedback software and hardware. I was happy with Amazon's quick credit back to my credit card, but i found this purchase totally lacking. The games it had you play were boring and i wouldn't suggest buying this for doing biofeedback 
 I have not received the books I ordered 3/01/2007, can you please check the address is 11357 SW 68 Ter, Miami, Fl  3317 
 Buy low and sell high. Keep stock for years and diversify your portfolio. Now you've already read the boo 
       Finally, "Making Love" is released on DVD. For those of you questioning my rating, let me explain. The ratings are supposed to be for the product (the DVD) not the film itself. I give the DVD a 2-star rating simply because it contains no extras. No commentary track, no "making of" featurette, no deleted scenes, no bloopers, no nothing (unless you count the trailer......and I don't count the trailer). The film I give a 3 1/2 to 4 star rating or a 5 star rating simply because Kate Jackson is in it.         Considered controversial and ground breaking for its time, today (as another reviewer mentioned) in the days of "Will and Grace" and "Queer as Folk" it seems rather mild by comparison. Still, that doesn't mean it isn't a good film. Yes, it is riddled with cliches and yes, it goes out of it's way to be as unoffensive as possible, yet "Making Love" tackles it's  subject in a fairly honest, forthright manner (especially when you consider it was filmed in 1982).          Although it's nice to see Jackson on Ontkean together again (since their days on the television series "The Rookies"), I never really bought Ontkean's performance. Even when I watch it today I feel he's too stiff and reserved, never really willing to open up and fully explore his character's conflicts and emotions. Jackson does some of her best work here (okay, so you know I'm a fan and somewhat biased but....hey, whatever). She has some genuinely touching moments, such as when she confesses her crush on her teacher to the camera ("Crepe paper is a [..] to tear"), when she talks on the phone with her father, or her final meeting with Zach. As he walks down the driveway and out of her life, the expression on her face breaks your heart. It's moments like these that make me very curious to see what Jackson could have done with the role of Joanna, the ex-wife of Dustin Hoffman's character in "Kramer Vs. Kramer". (She was originally offered the role but the producers of Charlie's Angels would not give her the time off). Harry Hamlin deserves kudos for taking a basically unlikable character and portraying him as such while showing the audience why he has built up this wall around himself. One reviewer noted that Zach unexplainably falls for Bart. I think it's perfectly understandable why Zach falls for him. Zach is in the middle of an identity crisis. Bart is the ONE gay man he actually knows on a personal level. It's only natural that he'd be drawn to him to learn more about himself, no matter how cocky or flippant Bart is.        So yes, the film has it's flaws (as most do) but I think it holds up pretty well after all these years. I just wish the DVD had some extras darn it!!  
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 This book was quite boring. Within the first few pages (when Ruby describes her own birth) hints were dropped about the ultimate "big secret" of the book. By the time I'd read a quarter of the book, there were so many hints it wasn't a secret any more. By the time I got to the end, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything more to the story than that. None of the characters were particularly likeable, nor were they bad enough to hate.  The book was billed as "darkly funny and satirical" in one review. I saw no humor except for the brief slapstick physical mishaps at a wedding reception late in the book. On reflection, I gained nothing from reading this book, and got about a half-minute of laughter from that one scene. It truly was a waste of my limited reading time 
 These are the worst Elvis covers done in a studio I've ever heard. I think she must have paid them to record her! Try early 55-56 Elvis, Stray Cats or early Gene Vincent if you want to hear Rockabilly. In my opinion this is complete nonsense and an insult to the fans of Rockabilly! Save your money 
 I bought this season (which really should be season 3) of Baywatch episodes because I am a die hard fan of the show. However, this set of DVD's was very misleading and poorly made. If the show started in 1989, then this set is Season 3 not Season 2. The very first 2 episodes of this season which weren't on the DVDs should have been included. It was the episode where Mitch and Hobie got up to the river to go white water rafting gold country and Shauni gets kidnapped by some gold theives. Plus Eddie and Shauni get married at the very end of the 2nd episode. Very disappointing! The theme song, "I'm Always here" performed by Jim Jamison is not the title theme getting replaced by something very cheesy that doesn't even fit the show. None of the music video songs are the same because I remember every episode from that season like it was yesterday. I will buy the other boxed sets, but the only reason why is because Baywatch was my favorite television show. If First look entertainment is going to make more boxed sets, please bring the old theme song back and place some of the missing episodes on future discs or you will have more disappointed customers. I only gave this set 2 stars because it was my favorite show at the time 
 I have a kitten I can't keep up with and thought this would be a great idea. Wrong, he figured it out and lost interest in the first day. He will play with it for a few minutes but then looks to see where the beam is coming from, figures it out and walks away. A whole 2 minutes of fun 
 The S9000 fits perfectly in the case. Too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop. Apparently, the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also. Too bad the camera strap is extremely short, made for very small people. So, instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well, I will adapt the case to work for me. I will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera. I can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on. It will work but only after extensive modification. Great camera design so it's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before 
 I recently purchased this book to strengthen my momentum skills. Being somewhat new to TA, it is has came easy having a extensive computer background. I found Prings explanation on oscillators complete but lacks  application to daytrading/investing. I met him at a recent show asking him  pertinent questions as they apply to the market and trading and he  replied...."I need to buy another book". This book is good on how  oscillators are made....NOT HOW THEY ARE USED 
 Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'  I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.   The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot 
 I was quite sickened after finishing this book.  For some reason Mr. Feist has decided to debunk, destroy and remove almost all sense of mystique and continuity from certain major characters, his overall world/universe plot and the magic contained within the original 4 books.  I feel he has dishonored his characters, the story and the readers.  I so wish Jenny Wurts had co-wrote this for maybe we would have been spared this clumsy, lazy, unfathomable revision.  Almost all of the major 'reasons' we were led to believe at the end of the Riftwar saga were actually lies - oops sorry!    Poor Macros the Black - you were just an ordinary fraud with borrowed power and lies oozing out of every oriface.    Poor Dragon Lords - simply a tool of some mad genocidal god.  Poor Pug - you are destined to become the acceptable, palid, PC version of Macros forever being written to come up with reasons to justify not using your power.  Poor Thomas - hobbled in terms of power and without any real focus, purpose or point.  I think that Feist for personal and philosophical reasons felt he had to mess with his earlier mainly flawless creation and has ended up crafting something that is in all ways medicore by comparison.   What a pity.  I will stop here now and buy no more of his books and try very hard to forget I ever read this 
 The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer. 
 The leaves are changing color and the days are getting cooler.  " I smell winter in the air," said bear.  " It is time for me to crawl into my cave and sleep."  " But I must tell snail  first."   	As a forest of friends, realize that the leaves are  changing and that winter is coming, they must tell each other. It starts  with bear, and she tells snail.  Snail tells skunk then skunk must tell  turtle and the list goes on. Finally, ladybug gets the message and she goes  to tell bear.  When she gets there, bear is already sleeping in her cave.  Lady bug wakes up bear and tells her that winter is near and that is time  for her to crawl into her cave and sleep.  Bear says "Ladybug, I am in  my cave and I was sleeping." Ladybug says she is sorry.   Then all the  animals say goodnight to each other. 	This book is not very exciting  compared to most children's books. There is not really a turning point.   All that the tale does is repeat the same thing from animal to animal. The  animals just tell each other that winter is coming and that it is time to  sleep. Author Denise Fleming did a poor job of writing the story.  The  moral of the story, which is to go to sleep when it is bedtime, was weak.   She could have easily put in more detail and action and still get the same  point across. 	Even though the author did a bad job with lack of  excitement she did do a good job of describing the setting and what was  going on.  When snail is moving Fleming used the words " slowly  slithered", when she described how turtle moved, she used the words  " trudged up Woodchucks hill," and she used the words "  scritch and scratch" to describe how skunk was digging.  By using  these words the reader can picture how the animals were moving. Although  the writing was bad the illustrations were good.  The pictures are the only  thing that the book has going for it.  The illustrator did a great job of  showing detail and using bright colors. The leaves were bright and  different colors, just as they would be expected to be in the fall.  Good  detail was also used with the shape of the leaves, trees, animals, and each  animal's house. Some other good things about the book are that the print is  big, there are only a few sentence on each page, and there are not very  many big words.  These are good examples of why this book would be good for  kids who are learning how to read. Because there are not a lot of big  words, so kids would be able to understand what they are reading. 	  Time to Sleep would make a great bedtime story, because it would probably  bore kids to death.  This book would be a great story for kids to read, but  because of its lack of excitement it wouldn't be a very good book to read  to them. 								- Jessica Pac 
 While this book was a good attempt at making a picture dictionary, it failed to create a good resource for English-speaking learners of Arabic.  If you are Arab and want to learn daily English, buy this book.  If you are learning Arabic, forget it.  As for the Arabic, not only is the Arabic difficult for many learners of the language (lacks pronunciation for those who can't read script), but it's not "real" Arabic.  After scanning through some of the pages, I started to get a weird feeling about the way the Arabic read; it just didn't sound natural.  So, I turned to the front to see who the authors and editors were - NOT ONE SINGLE ARAB!!!  There were maybe 20 or 30 contributors, all of whom were non-Arabs.  If you used some of the phrases in this dictionary in an Arab country, not only would the Arabs look at you funny, but they'd probably beat you up.  Another problem is that all of the pictures in the book were pictures of daily life in America.  Although this helps beginners to relate to the new words, it does not help anyone who is attempting to learn Arabic in an authentic way.  Even the map of time zones is of the United States.  Once again, if you are a student of Arabic, avoid this book, unless you have extra money and want a bigger library.  If you are an Arab immigrating to the U.S., perhaps you should buy this book 
 None of these covers "changed the world". Whether they will admit it or not, the American media don't rule the world. Least of all Life Magazine. If they're so important, why did they go out of business 
 This book was as much the author's opinion and imagination as anything else. He makes claims that are not substiantiated by facts, biblical or otherwise. I will not purchase further books by this author 
 The authors no doubt know Investment analysis. Unfortunately they don't communicate that information too well. Frequently happens when Phd's forget they are writing to students, not other Phd's. Bought this book for a senior level finance course, required to complete my major in finance.  Even my Prof. started the course with, "the textbook is difficult to read but just follow my notes and you should do ok". Not too good of an endorsement for a textbook. Now, after completing the course, I am searching for another text on the subject to keep as a reference. Even after the lectures, this book's explinations of the same topics are difficult to follow 
 Barry Longyear's story is perfect. This movie could have been but what was that bull at the end with the whips and factory slaves and that stuff? They should have ended the movie as the story ended and not added that last bit. That totally ruined the movie for me. The novella and its sequel at least give humanity the benefit of a doubt; the war is over and there is an uneasy peace and humanity, if love doesn't prevail, at least strives to be better. In the movie, they made humans brutal savages in the way they treated the Dracs. Did we learn NOTHING from the USA's foray into slavery and brutality? IT seemed that a violent ending was gratuitously grafted onto the movie to make it more palatable to the 13-18 year old testosterone crown, thereby destroying what could have been as perfect a film as the novella was perfect. But, when has Hollywood ever gotten it right? They usually find some way to shoot themselves in the foot. 
 This is one of the all time worst electronic engineering books I have ever encountered.  A few minutes searching the Maxim web site will find most of the material.  90% of the examples are simply reprints from Maxim data sheets, or Maxim app. notes and engineering handbooks.  Most of the material is out of date, even allowing for the book being 10 years old.   It does not cover modern battery technologies (such as LiIon, or LiPoly), and does not really cover any of the "stuff" other than the switching supply itself.  Notable by not being there would be any material on micropower processors, logic, interfacing across logic families, latchup, linear peripherals, low power switching, protection, design techniques, measurements, and a host of others.  A better title might have been "Some out of date Maxim medium power Switcher Datasheets briefly explained".  Sorry John -- you have published some good work, but this isn't it 
 ****this review is NOT for the superbit version***** The 2 star rating is not for the movie, but the fact that the description on this site says its widescreen; it kind of sucks when you get the movie in the mail, it says on the movie case its widescreen, yet its full screen, not much you can do.  Can someone at Amazon change the product description to reflect whats going on?  It would help out 
 Absolute mindless tosh, stick to Iggy pop , this is a waste of plastic and oxygen on the part of the artists 
 The writer of this book has found the real threat to gays and lesbians:  radical Islam.  Really, what have Right Wing Christians ever done?  Nothing.  The NEA has more political power than Christians.  The Muslim aim is to take over the world and exterminate "infidels".  That's us.  That all of us.  The Christian right wing can't even stop graphic sex education at their local schools.  They are not a threat.  Heck, Christians are not a serious worry.  They are not a worry.  Do not buy this book.  It's obsolete.  The author, Bruce Bawer, says it's obsolete.  We can't ignore Islam.  Why?  All GLBT people will be eliminated by Islam.  That is a face.  Read Bruce Bawer's book "While Europe Slept."  We may actually want to be friends with Christians.  Why?  Islam means to destroy us all!  All good feminists should be worried. 
 This is a really cool concept, poorly executed.  The clear sleeve slides up and down on an aluminum cylinder.  The top of the cylinder is a rubber gasket that seals the sleeve, thus preventing leakage between the sleeve and the cylinder.  All of that works fine.  The problem is that at the bottom of the aluminum cylinder is a plastic ring of a larger diameter than the cylinder.  This ring stops the sleeve from sliding below the top of the cylinder, and also acts as a foot so you can stand the measuring cup.  Unfortunately, the ring is made from a fairly hard plastic, which can become brittle and crack.  But it doesn't break away cleanly - so you're left with a measuring cup that won't stand up straight.  That might be fine if you're measuring things and dumping them straight into a bowl, but if you have to sit the thing down while it's full, forget it 
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
 Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did 
 A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity.  
 I read all Jonathan Kellerman books, but this one put me to sleep. I was disappointed. I also think he should resolve this love interest and get Robin back. Allison needs to go. His books were better with Robin. These issues get boring after awhile 
 If you love Calatrava's work (as I do), choose another book. This could have been an excellent book if it had been well illustrated. It isn't 
 Having grown up in Coney Island I found this effort to be extremely substandard. This book takes the most uninteresting pictures of the most uninteresting individuals that I can imagine. Mr. Stein would have done much better to find alot more of the old timers who truly represent the feel and atmosphere of What Coney Island was, not so much the depressing delapidated dangerous neighborhood that it most unfortunately has become. He did not look hard enough to find what is truly representative of the Coney of lore, because had he done so, it's still there, just difficult to unearth. The pictures of the parade just shows how far down Americas greatest playground has gone. Do yourselves a favor and go to the library and pick out any number of other books on Coney Island and then compare. Unfortunately, you might become meloncoly and saddened, for Coney is really just a microcosm of what has become of this nations great cities 
 You guessed it: It's the same leftist b.s. we were all taught in school. Please, I'm already almost asleep...spare me these tired old lies 
 Betty's voice is still strong and beautiful but arrangements of most beloved songs are simply horrible.   If you prefer traditional versions this concert is not for you.  The quality of image and sound is very good.  Can be recommended only to hardcore fans 
 "Whitehead" doesn't refer to something on the face.  Although, like puss spewing therefrom, the book is a morass of grotesque prose.  What is Whitehead getting at that so many scholars seem to ignore completely?  At the core of Whitehead's philosophy is "bifurcation of nature."  From this, Ph.D's have waxed eloquent and stated, "Aha, Whitehead is a panentheist," meaning, the universe contains a god like a spirit in the body.  Hmmmm.  Modern democrats espouse an unusually similar theory that cannot be coincidence.  Nevertheless, everyone has missed the point.  First and foremost, to his credit, Whitehead had great command over mathematics and modern ideas in science.  More noteworthy is the fact that quantum mechanics (micro physics) and relativity theory (macro physics) cannot be reconciled (unless we use Hermann Weyl's guage theory, which implements methods from group theory, which is nothing but mathematical formalism and reconstruction with no physical meaning).  The theories are irreconcilable since relativity predicts via E=mc squared that an electron, which approaches the speed of light, must approach infinity.  Yet, the physical fact is that an electron is of finite weight (although, I think a clue to this problem is in nuclear fission, aka the fact of the atom bomb).  Whitehead resolved to accept that both quantum mechanics and relativity theory are both true, or rather, complete unto themselves for the domain of physical phenomena they addressed, and resolved to accept they cannot be reconciled.  This resolution is formulated in his fundamental hypothesis about the bifurcation of reality.  Case closed 
 Hi...I bought this book looking for a nice aquarium reference text and was extremely disappointed. I went on to buy  Baensch's book and was infinitely more pleased. I was expecting more from the man who is almost like the Jacques Cousteau of aquarium fish. The text has excellent pictures, but, if you think you can easily find your most common local fish store fish in this tome by using the index, FORGET IT. Most of the fish I have in my aquarium I couldn't find, except, perhaps, by flipping the pages. I'd stick with Baensch's (will all due respect Dr. Axelrod). It's better organized, the index works and agree that it has a great plant section. Have fun 
 This book did not provide me with any valuable information with respect to fireplace design.  I felt the book was vague and the majority of photographs were of traditional fireplaces.  I was looking for contemporary designs and styles that would compliment different room types and configurations.  This book is very predictable in text and in photos, nothing new here 
 I found this book to be ponderous and, in the end, unreadable.  I gave up on it with only 100 pages left to read - I cared that little about what was going to happen to the characters.  The book is now in the donation bin of my local public library 
 I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.  The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.  Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.  The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's naï¿½ve and unique generosity.  That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.   For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!  In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.  She wants readers to get an "insight into the psychology" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.  My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.   I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is "The Virgin's Lover"... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel "The Queen's Fool" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful "Earthly Joys" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)  So, get "The Other Boleyn Girl" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).   But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's "Legacy" 
 While this Modern Library edition is attractively produced, all teachers and students who hope to use it in an academic setting should be aware that this is a severe abridgement--it represents about one-eighth of the original text from 1660-1669.  As a result, there are large gaps in continuity, exacerbated by a lack of editorial notes to fill in those gaps.  Also, the abridgement omits many of the sexiest passages and seems tailored to a Victorian sensibility.  .. 
 This book lacks the information about the horse more info of everything else. The book put more effort into the apparel and activites of the horse. Than actually telling about horses and what they need 
 First off, you should by the Pedaller's Paradise instead of Lonely Planet.  It can be found for about 12 NZD in New Zealand (but is also available through Amazon for a bit more if you can't wait).  Dangerous - The profiles (ie. graphical descriptions of hills) shown in the Lonely Planet Guide are drastically over-simplified.  On a good day, this is only just very annoying.  On a bad day, it could mean being out in the cold wondering just how many more hills are before the next stop.  It is obvious that the writers did not use bicycles to research the routes.  Nor did they use GPS or any other precise means of measuring elevation.  They were very lazy about how they threw this guide together, and it will get you into trouble.  Avoid it!    Buy the Pedallar's Paradise instead - it is a fraction the size, half the cost, and packed with useful information 
 I like Patagonia and admire the company's philosophies, but this book felt like one big, long self-aggrandizing advertisement for the company.  The title of the book really says it all if you're looking for good business management practices.  No need to read any further.  But the history of the company is quite interesting, and their efforts to be environmentally responsible are inspiring 
 This is all around a pretty mediocre, uninspired exposition of quantum field theory.  More recent works by Weinberg and Peskin & Schroder, for example, are far more coherent and elegant 
 I'm sorry I wasted the money. I can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it.  I'm not squeamish by nature, but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims, but animals as well.  Three quarter's way through, when I realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end, I started skipping these parts (which got me to the last page quite quickly). I was bored and disgusted with the author.  I believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages. In the end my eyeballs got six-pack abs from rollng around so much.  This book is going on my "Do Not Lend" shelf as I value my friends and wouldn't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense.  
 Bottom line... 1. If you liked Gore, you will love it and visa versa. 2. It is one-sided, plain and simple.   3. Nobody considers the poor inept voter who failed to comprehend a simple ballot, or the responsibility of a voter to unsterstand at least enough English to distinguish "GORE from BUSH".  Democrats wanted quantity, and the lack of quality also extended into the indecisive and ambiguous recount procedures that hundreds of lawyers just couldn't get right.  
 I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.  I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone 
 This book is so predictable and boring that I couldn't read past Vicky's first trip to America to meet Amber.  I didn't even get to the swap.  And, that was already more than halfway through the book!  I couldn't find myself liking either of the main characters at all.  Vicky over-romanticized everything so much it made you sick, and Amber was living such an exaggerated, spoiled life, it was surreal.    This book was so overwritten and dragged on horribly!  Save yourself time and read a book with some substance.  Leave this one in the store 
 Being a looooong time Batman fan City of Crime ranks as one of the worst stories I have ever read in a Bat-title. Do not waste your time on this one. It was a 12 issue series that disappoints.  
 It's about what I expected after reading the article in the Washington Post several years ago.  I wouldn't waste your money on this book.  I can forgive anything if it's well written - this isn't 
 What a disappointment!  There is no documentation whatsoever.  For example, astronomers and astrologers agree that there are fixed stars assigned to every day of the year (and used for birthdays), but none appear here.  This author cites stars, but gives no hint of where/how she arrived at them (and, no, they're not the same as fixed stars).  Likewise, she cites guardian angels for each day of birth, but, again, her's differ from those in other books, but give no hint of where/how she arrived at them.  She assigns everything from trees to composers to each DOB, but gives no hint of whether these are well-researched, or figments of her imagination.  Moreover, padding is used to make the book look much fatter than it really is ... If there are only eleven guardian angels, there is no need to repeat the definition of each one on every page -- and this is done for all subjects and topics.  In short, this book was a huge disappointment, and is being returned.  I don't understand why the author couldn't cite any sources or give any clues to how she arrived at her information. A bibliography would have been ideal, but if she'd at least briefly referenced this, it would have been okay.  Without it, the book was garbage 
 Have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it. Simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme.  They say we Americans are obese in body, but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism.  Page after page of glossy ads for things we do NOT need.  And rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections.  Sure they make pretty pictures, but who wants all that 'junk' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful.  I recommend the magazine Dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning.  For someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden, Oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply. And how many homes does one American need, when so many Americans cannot afford even one 
 I expected to really enjoy this book, but was disappointed.  Some of the stories/essays were very good, but some of them were poorly written and/or could have done with some serious editing. It might have been better if some of them had been omitted: the book would probably have been half as long, but the overall quality would have been significantly improved.  I was also disappointed by the way the book was laid out.  It seemed jumbled and poorly conceived.  Photos, illustrations and cartoons/comics were seemingly thrown in randomly, with little context or relation to the surrounding content. The graphic content of the book was good, but the layout just did not display it to full advantage.  The idea behind this book was a good one, but the execution could have been a little bit better 
 I have read hundreds of true crime books and I followed the story of Lori Hacking in the news very closely.  So when I was on vacation and was looking for a book to read on the airplane, I was happy to see that a book had been written about Lori's story.  I am now very disappointed that I did not have the benefit of Amazon's customer reviews before wasting my money on this book.  The author did not talk to any family members (save maybe Paul, who had one or two quotes in the entire book).  The book was written from a reporter's perspective and added no detail that I had not already read in news reports when the story was unfolding several years ago.  He even quoted the National Enquirer.  Here are some quotes from this book:  "While Winslow had his scoop, and would lead others to the story, the Deseret Morning News held an edge.  The paper, which had been founded by Brigham Young, would make the playing field uneven for other news outlets working the story.  Throughout coverage of the case, journalists from the Deseret Morning News got access to family members of Lori and Mark Hacking when other news outlets did not.  Why should journalists from the old Deseret News and Church-owned KSL get all the leads?" (p. 108)  "The AP reporter hadn't paid much attention to the missing persons story out of City Creek Canyon when it first broke.  After all, it was local and would be of only passing interest to the wire service clients who subscribed at radio and television stations and newspapers across Utah, much less the ones on the national wire.  But word travels fast among AP clients, and the wire service's Utah office learned that the North Carolina television station had broken a major story on the Hacking disappearance.  The AP reporter was now assigned full time to the story as the AP moved the item." (p. 133).  "Network television producers and guest bookers have a power that print journalists envy.  The lure of the camera, the desire to appear on national television, boils under the surface of a surprising number of ordinary citizens. . . .  But three outlets had an edge, and they covered both print and electronic news.  The Church-owned Deseret Morning News and KSL radio and television often managed to beat the competition, both in print and on the air." (p. 143-144).  "The editorial showed how out of touch the hierarchy of The Salt Lake Tribune had become in its ignorance of how major media work.  Worse, it demonstrated a shallow view fired by a desire of city fathers to manipulate the image of the city.  Members of the national media laughed when they read it and e-mailed it to their home offices, who laughed as well." (p. 149)  "Money is a lawyer's curse and blessing.  The curse is simple:  If there is a Hell, surely some of them will find their particular circle to roast on for defending their clients who paid them.  The blessing is equally simple:  They will live well, eat well, drink well, and have the most articulate friends around until that day comes and they face the Devil himself." (p. 153).  Anyone who writes true crime books should realize that the American system of justice includes the Constitutional right to an attorney for all accused of a felony, and to compare a defense attorney to the Devil for doing his or her job is ridiculous coming from a true-crime author.  The portion of the book describing the weeks when the police were digging through the landfill was torturous:  Page 172: "Tedium quickly became the norm, yet once in a while the search would stop as cops would walk over to look in the pit that had been dug.  When that happened, reporters scrambled, knowing only that the cops had broken the routine and were doing something different.  Maybe that meant they had found something.  The journalists sitting along the road joked among themselves that they were stationed in a media version of summer camp, although a smelly one.  Some brought lawn chairs, chips, cookies, and sodas."  For crying out loud.  It was at this part of the book that I began rolling my eyes on a regular basis at the absurdity of this story and the wonder that any publisher would accept it.  I try not to criticize a book without reading the entire thing, and because I was trapped on an airplane with nothing else to do, I finished this one.  It never got any better.  I cannot say that a news reporter would not find this book interesting, but I can certainly say that no one else will.  The story of Lori Hacking broke my heart.  I only hope that a really good author (Jerry Bledsoe, Carlton Stowers, Ann Rule, Charles Bosworth) will do us all a favor and tell Lori's story the way it should be told.  I would recommend to anyone "A Killer Among Us" by Charles Bosworth, Jr. -- a story about a husband who hired someone to kill his 28-year-old wife and the mother of his 4 children, Elizabeth DeCaro.  That book will make you cry, and you will feel the pain of each family member because Bosworth brings you inside each person's heart.  Elizabeth's memory was done justice by Bosworth, and I only hope that someday we can say the same for Lori 
 This book totally sucks! When I bought it, I was like, yes! a good book finally! But majorly, this book is the worst book ever! I repeat: DON'T GET THIS BOOK 
 The worst book I've read (actually, I was listening to the audiobook).  The characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that I found myself YELLING at the tape player, "I KNOW, I KNOW ALREADY".  I couldn't stand the torture anymore, I didn't even finish it.  I have enjoyed some of DS's earlier work, but will not buy another 
 Unsure of what else to do besides mount my work on stark black pages I set out in search of some reference material. Since this book is called Creative Portfolios I assumed it would give me a taste of how other designers make their portfolio's stand out. Boy, was I wrong. Thankfully I checked this out of the library instead of wasting money on it. This book is mainly all text and is obviously extremely outdated. Don't waste your money 
 If you don't like seeing the message "Unable to connect to preferred wireless network," then don't waste your time with this God-awful piece of crap.  I lose my Internet connection once or twice every single time I'm online.  The other computer in my network is a 6-year-old Dell with a Netgear card, and I have not once lost my connection on it, and the Internet is much faster.  My computer is a new eMachines, but with this junky D-Link card, and the Internet is barely usable.  Also, the two computers are in adjacent rooms, so range is not a factor at all.  They are both running off a Linksys router.  I have had problems with other D-Link products as well.  I had a network bridge which I returned because after following all the instructions and calling tech support, it just didn't work.  Also, before the Linksys router, I had a D-Link one for about two weeks before I returned it because of its very slow speeds and inability to maintain a connection.  Don't waste your time with D-Link.  If you are starting a network from scratch, I would recommend getting all Linksys components 
 The Chinese victory over the USA will make you ask this question.  What's wrong with America?  Thousands of things.  USA dishonors Christ through its sexual immorality.  Look at the rampant pre-marital sex in America.  Don't tell me that America is a Holy Nation or a Christian Nation.  It's not.  China is more pure.  We illegalize homosexuality and forbid pre-marital sex.  China is a more pure nation.  Christian writers don't seem to care about the purity of America.  Mr. Philip Yancey hasn't written one book on it.  I rest my case 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 Gilles Kepel's ultimate message in this book is clear: the Western democracies should not exaggerate the threat of Islamic terrorism because it is on the decline. This, however, is far from certain. Kepel bases his analysis , and his conclusion, on a very small amount of evidence gathered from a few Muslim countries. He has , as might be expected, no access to the internal debate of the various terror organisations that operate throughout the Muslim world. Another problem is that Kepel does not seem to understand the importance of such traditions as " kitman" and " taqyyiah" in the Islamic culture which make it incumbent on the believer to hide his real beliefs and feelings whenever and wherever he senses that the general environment might be hostile to him. The fact that Kepel, who seems to know a little bit of Arabic, has no knowledge of Persian, Turkish, Urdu and other major Islamic languages is a further handicap as the bulk of the ideological litrerature of terror is curently produced in those languages, and not in Arabic. M 
 The early entries in the book (first 100 pages) are very interesting tales of unconventional lives revealing the author's confusion with his/her ethnicity.  However, after ten or so entries, the reading becomes old and repitive revealing many Americans need to preach their problems.  Being biracial/multicultural is not a problem but a gift which I can personally attest.  The readings need more creativity in establishing a point that is engaging but captivating.  Its too easy to simply say back when I was 4 I came to the realization that... and over and over again.  With this book all I can say is find the entry which most relates to your personal history because this book proves that the whole is not greater than the sum, of a portion mind you,of its parts 
 The Starter Wife started out promisingly vapid, in an entertaining way, but rapidly became more disgusting than anything else.  The narcissitic self obsession rang true (not surprising given the author's similar lifestyle), and the ways in which it was indulged were fascinatingly ridiculous.  However, those descriptions only hold interest for so long, and then the book digresses into an unrealistic, annoying conclusion.  The insight into an actual L.A. Wife Of lifestyle is unbelievable enough; to try to throw in a homeless guy that leads an exemplary lifestyle then reconciles with his family and inherits their billions... there's a limit to the willful suspension of disbelief.  
 type smudges / translation bad / in short, a disposable boo 
 I purchased this DVD with the thought of replacing my VHS versions of same.  I expected Joe Garagiola & Vin Scully narrating the 1986 World Series as they did on television and Lindsay Nelson & Curt Gowdy for the 1969 which were the official broadcasters on NBC.  I got neither.  If you own these World Series classics on VHS, don't discard them for this DVD 
 I witnessed the rise of this man and his designs over the years and I must say it is very hard not to be appealed and seduced by him. He is what he is and he knows this quite well, and is not afraid to share his existence with the rest of the world.  This man was the biggest groundbreaker since Gianni. He became one with the company Gucci, and made his identity mold and cover the company's personality and stance from top to the finest detail in image, production, design, PR and most importantly, in business. It is hard to resist his presence and power.  As a design student, I must say he is also quite inspiring. He is creative alright, has a sense of style and business, ever so perfect, walks the walk, talks the talk, and refines and redefines design according to what he knows best. And it seems he has an answer for everything, because he is basically the 'it' - the tastemaker, the designer, the Oscar Wilde of this era.  I love him for that and he will forever be the story of perfection and power to me.   But the book... for a hard cover block heavier than my fridge, it is just sooo empty. More empty pages than the ones with words on them, more celebrity oriented and focused images than the actual designs and his vision, much less compelling and a lot more reduced -correct word is 'dry'- explanations of his mind and vision...  It is just empty. Why putting images of the likes of Lil Kim, or Eve, and whatever seemed more important than a few more shots from the runways, his sketches, his houses, office space, mag covers etc., I do not know.  It is very hard to find the images or prints of his designs, ad campaigns included wonderful parfume ads, accessories from watches to the infamous bamboo heel stillettos etc, but he would not put any of these that made him who he is internationally, instead we have to see the same dress on a gorgeous model, and on the facing page, we had to see it again on Lil Kim in a very bad tabloid shot.   I dont know how much of his creative ddecisions went into editing the book, but still, it is unacceptable. This is not an art book. This is a book titled as TOM FORD in capital letters, but you do not get the sense of his presence at all. When you title a book with your name, you promise a lot to the audience, and this book just seemed unfinished or very badly edited. I did not expect a biography obviously, and I am happy that it is a visual book, because I always thought that the guy is more of a 2D person than a one dimensional one, but still for a man that has a lot to say and show, there was so much lacking and missing for a huge book of over 400 glossy pages.  Still, I think any price is cheap for this man and his gorgeous book, but still... This is closest the came near imperfection (literally, by my first copy was printed incorrectly-had two inroductions and no interview-changed it later), and I believe this book does not represent a celebration of him, but almost him trying to show what and how much Gucci will lose when he is gone including his celebrity fans etc.    PS: it is funny that he only has one face expression, at least in these photos. 
 Does anyone care about the opinions of a senile pompous windbag like Mailer?  The man is so longwinded.  He couldn't tell a straightforward story if his life depended on it.  Mailer should keep quiet and stick to what he knows, like writing unreadable tomes and stabbing his wife 
 My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie 
 First, a full disclosure -- I run my own pet-sitting business and I'm a happy, paid member of Patti's organization, Pet Sitters Internaitonal (PSI).  She's a good business woman who had the sense to get out of the industry and create alliances to help those in the industry. Second disclosure, I run an organization geared directly toward helping petsitters start and run a successful business so that they can enjoy their life, work with great clients and retire happy.  Now, onto the review.  I bought this book about 6 months after I started sitting full-time.  I had already bought, read and devoured Lori and Scott Mangold's book.    This book was a disappointment to me -- it had been touted for so long by so many that I know and respect as THE BIBLE of pet-sitting.  So, I guess I was expecting fireworks and drumrolls.  None of that is here.  It's basic. It's not quite a how-to and definitely not the Complete Manual for Professional Success.  But then, a complete manual would need to be much larger and more expensive.    There are alot of ambiguities as noted by other reviewers and I really wish there was a more extensive Appendix listing places to get information regarding licensing, insurance, employees vs ICs etc. for each state.  But, there's still a good overview of the business here.  So it's worth having in your library -- I just wouldn't depend on this as my sole guide to starting and running a successful pet-care business.   
 I found out that there isn't any difference with Adkins for Life from the first book.  Disappointing,  I tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results.  However, I never support anything unless I have been convinced it truly does what it says and I found that with "the average joes diet."  A friend told me about it and I was always considered the fat girl.  No longer! and it's stayed off. 
 Speaking as a graduate student in physics who is condemned to sort through this abominable text, I strongly discourage anyone from engaging in this book if they are given the choice.   It's presentation is extremely fragmented, and explanations obscure - survey unlucky students who are condemned to this text and they will tell you that learning particle physics has been a matter of finding other strong treatments.  Not at all recommended.  I am disturbed by the five star marks awarded by Amazon 
 The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat "hero" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed 
 I could give 5 stars for the pictures but becouse of a big mistake, stars come down. Okay the photos are good but somewhere I am very dissapointed. On page August 22, where the comments for the picture were about the genocide of Jewish, it was written that Turks did the same thing to Armenians. But that was a lie. Some nummamorous people told this allegation and the writer believes them. This is very sad. If someone writing a book, he/she must be very careful about his/her words. Books must not contain allegations. Or author must tell that it was an allegation, unless it is proved 
 I received a painful injury and almost lost my finger to this recliner. I grabbed the arm rest, and tried to slide back into the recliner. The mechanism under the arm rest snapped closed on my finger. I could not get out of this "trap". Had my wife not been there to help, I would have lost my finger. No way should this chair be sold to an unsuspecting public! 
 OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.  No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays 
 I began following this author quite a while ago including reading ealier books because there wasn't that much information about baking sourdough bread.  He has simplified the directions a little but I was never successful with his directions until I took a course at King Arthur and discovered that baking sourdoughs isn't all that complicated. Now I make naturally leavened bread almost every week.  I finally trashed the silly "proof box" that Mr. Wood recommends.  I occasionally dip into this book to try the recipes and I'm pretty sure some of them have significant errors (the SF sourdough turns out more like a ciabatta because either the flour or water measurments are wrong).  If you want a really good book on bread baking check out "Bread A Baker's Book of Techniques and Recipes" by Jeffrey Hamelman.  It has lots of good sourdough recipes based on solid baking formulas 
 I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse. It arrived and I immediately saw a defect,in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly, even with major force. I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them. I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me. Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter's organization but without any success. I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and, in particular, the after sales service.

 I was disappointed when I received this book.  The title is very deceitful.  What the book really showed was posed photographs of rock stars and actors.  What was not shown were detailed photographs of tattoos, nor was there really any explanation or narrative about the individual photograph itself.  The book is weak and definately not for someone interested in tattoos.  However, if your interested in photographs of a few famous people, you should buy the book 
     Let me start by saying I think that in general, Binney and his music are fresh air. The melodies in much of his music are beautiful,arrangements very cool and his music seems more textured or layered than a lot of modern jazz.     he also seems to understand how to use drama in his compositions better than most.    Now,to this album; unfortunately, i have to say I was let down by this music,especially in light of how much I enjoy his music typically.    There are a few "free" tunes with what sounds to me to be combined performances to give a semblence of structure. The first tune fits this mold and is more interesting than the other tunes in the same vein but still not enough to bring me back to it.     the tunes which are more composed are not as good in any way as his previous recordings. in fact, the best tunes are not even composed by Binney and they feel to me like pale imitations of his earlier work.   All in all, the record seems as if less care went into the music and as if Binney has been bit a little too much by the brooding,droning "New York" thing. Pick up "Welcome to Life".-I promise you won't regret it 
 This is one of the greatest books ever written 
 Good information in general, but there a lot of instructions that are unclear and/or EXTREMELY poorly edited (spelling/grammar mistakes etc). The book itself is not good quality and pages are already starting to fall out of my barely-month-old copy. 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 I received this product in good shape. However, it makes loud noises when it is heating, almost like fire cracker. Had to return and get a replacement.   Amazon provided excellent service. Quickly shipped a second one and took the first one back without charging me shipping 
 This stuff has a very strong smell -- like WD-40 or something.  If you can stand the smell, you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt.  I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless, like all other treadmill lubricant I've bought.  But it isn't odorless.  It really stinks.  I don't like that permeating smell in my house, especially in my workout room.  I recommend the LifeSpan 100% silicone lubricant.  It's a little pricier for the quantity you receive, but it's the good (odorless) stuff 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 OK, Anna May Wong didn't get the part in The Good Earth which went to a European about 70 years ago.  Get over it; most of us have!  Typical academic whine in which everything is wrong and nothing is right with America.  No credit is given for repealing racist laws, expanding tolerance and opportunity.  Authors think the Weathermen and Bobby Seale had something important to say.  Omits many interesting and most positive aspects of the Chinese immigrant saga in America 
 This fat volume about food and cooking, packed with anecdotes and trivia and stories, is amusing but completely unreliable.  As a source of information about the history of food, it is useless.  Many of the assertions of fact here are questionable, and none of them are footnoted so you can check them out. The author seems to have taken snippets from here and there (mostly, apparently, from French sources), sorted them thematically, and uncritically assembled them into a continuous text.  No doubt a large proportion of the assertions here are true, but there is no way of telling the difference between the true ones and the others!  What's more, the translation is poor.  Not only are some gallicisms rendered word-for-word (and so only intelligible if you translate them back into French), but there are no translator's notes for topical references.  I cannot recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in the history of food 
 I got this book because of the fame of John Gary and the big title of the book. I managed to go through half of the book and finally, I cannot stand it and throw it away.  Basically, this book gives you 9 principles to bring miracles to your life, like eating healthy, love as if it is your first love, blablablah. Yeah, it is true, but it is also totally vain and misleading. For example, everybody knows that if you eat healthy food and work out intensively four times a week, two hours each time, you will definitely be fit as supermodel. But, can anybody really do that if somebody just told you to do so? It has to be tricky to deal with like finding the right and affordable workout program, finding the incentive, etc.  What I found ridiculous is that John kept saying that if you believe in his nine principles, then you can do whatever you want. Even superman cannot do that! Well, John, have you accomplished all of your wishes in your life? Belief is necessary for any success, but it is not a guarantee for all successes.  Also, John made some metaphors to prove his points, but most of them don't make enough or any sense, at least to me. Another reason I hate the book is that it takes the first 1/3 to boast his former achievements, like 12 bestsellers, without touching the core topic of this book.  If you are looking for practical miracles in this book, I assure you that you will be practically disappointed, period 
 This book is possibly the stupidest book I have ever read. The stories are boring with no plot or character development. Do not read this book 
 I'm no idiot (I have an honours degree in psychology and an MBA) but this book was completely incomprehensible to me.  If I lived in the States I would have returned it!  I suspect only readers with a scientific education can appreciate this book - and maybe they'll find it excellent - but it definitely is not for the generalist 
 I really like the Crane humidifiers for children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time.  It occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet.  So I was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good.  I was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than I had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different.  Still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off.  This may be a fault with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be a design flaw with this shape.  I have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere.  So although I haven't had chance to use it I am more hopeful of success. It is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them, I forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time 
 Had to get a credit because Vendor never shipped and would not respond to email 
 This book is a pioneering effort to simplify network analysis for the unitiated but... there are too many eccentricities and mistakes for this tome to be taken seriously as either  a technical guide (see Wasserman and Faust) or a sociological simplification 
 The difference between cant and deceit is that the peddler of cant believes his own nonsense.  In this case, the cant begins with the very title "the Jewish New Testament". Jews have one ONE (1) Testament: it's called the Tanakh by Jews and the "Old Testament" by Christians. If you accept the "New Testament" as sacred scripture, you are (intellectually) not a Jew anymore but something else.    I would use the same argument if the roles were reversed --- if this were, say, an ex-Catholic convert to Judaism arguing that one can reject half the Nicean creed, downgrade the "New Testament" to literature-plus, and still be an evangelical Christian. One cannot.   Let Jews be Jews (although some might wish to learn a bit more about what makes believing Christians tick), and let Christians be Christians (although they may wish to learn more about the Jewish roots of their own faith --- commendably, an increasing number are). Each serving G-d in their own way.  To use a Jewish metaphor: Judaism is like meat and Christianity like dairy. Each, prepared according to the relevant rules, is kosher in itself, but mixtures of meat and dairy are always TREIF (nonkosher) 
 I read Mr/Ms Sparks glowing review and felt someone needed to mention some of the "not so good" aspects of this device: If you are a Windows XP user and want to back up your machine, it probably wont work. FAT32 limits the size of the file to 4GB.  If you think you can solve this problem by formatting it as NTFS, it wont work either.  If you think its fast, it isn't! especially if you are using WiFi.   As far as what is advertised, it works good, easily installed and not too noisy. 
 Prince has made some fabulous music the past 25 years or so. But this album, Come, is his weakest one.  The songs are bad, Letitgo was the only good song here, and the funk is seriously lacking here.  It was one of his last albums for Warner Bros. Records, but I can tell that his relationship with them went sour. They were supportive during his Purple Rain era, but later disintegrated long after that.  Fortunately, Musicology is selling like crazy now, which makes this 1994 album completely forgettable. Save your money and get his latest one, Purple Rain or 1999 instead.  Even Prince could say himself that this album sucked! 
 I was disapointed by this book. The author ideas are very intersting and deserve 5 stars. However, every chapter starts with very few pages of text then continues with a copy/past of NTSB reports. The book has about 500 pages more than 400 arn't original work but just publicly available accident reports 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 Title: Strengthen the Mind Composer:Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Performer:Takato Nishizaki and Malcolm Bilso 
 The best expample of what this book is all about is his criticism of Ann Coulter (who I think needs to be criticized).  She refers to one of her books in an interview and says that the book has lots of footnotes.  Al Franken points out that there are no footnotes in the book.  Sure enough, hes' right...there are no footnotes....they're actually endnotes. She misspoke......so he calls her a liar!  And, of course, that makes everything that she says and writes a lie!  Very childish and I would suspect very damaging to his own political party 
 "The myths in this collection use their Roman names..." -Quoted from page 71 of book.  Um...why does this book use Roman names if it is supposed to be a collection of Greek Myths?  Very confused.  I think that "D'aulaire's Book of Greek Myths" is a better book of the same caliber.  
 Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway. 
 Mailer tells us a lot we don't want to know about. It's the gloomy long tale of an egocentric writer's acceptance of the ups and downs of his metier. He gives his biased opinions on things he knows and things he doesn't know about. All the negative aspects of his persona are laid out. Still, it must have taken some bravery to lay out some of them. Or else he needed the money. Truth sells, even if it is a very mediocre unfocused book, and quite un-useful. It should have been titled "Me and My Books, Some thoughts on me and my writing" 
 We bought the Vitamix 5000 about 1 1/2 years ago. Since then we had  only trouble with the machine. With the easiest load the motor shuts off and I have to put it in the fridge, because it gets overheated. Despite returning it 3 times for repair the issue is still not resolved!  I then asked for our money back but Vitamix's customer service was very unfriendly and refused to refund.  To anyone who wants to buy one: Don't do it!!! You have only trouble and the customer service really sucks. Save yourself some trouble... I'm not a review writer but that Vitamix matter was really annoying. I just wanted to let you know what we ran into.    We are most likely looking at the BlendTec instead hoping that a) it actually works and b) we get better service in case we do need it. 
 If you are looking for a book on how to live on a limited income, this is not your book.  Nina Wildorf seems to live in a world that doesn't involve student loans, car payments, or the idea of a savings account.  Her rule of thimb for budgeting is 20% of your income towards clothes.  This is not fical responsibility.   And only wash your jeans every 6 months so that they don't fade?  Really?  Am I the only one who thinks this is odd?  On the other hand, she does have some cute ideas for decorating on the cheap--I am glad to see that someone besides me goes dumpster diving! 
 I was very disapointed with this book - give it to my college son and he and roommates tried many and thought they were awful.  Of course, what can you expect of ramen noodles?  My fault for the cholce I guess 
 I bought this book based upon Amazon reader reviews. There was little advice that was other than common sense, and much that was silly at best (for example bring water from your old home). The major points could be summed up: have an open mind, be flexible, bring old things so you are comfortable, and find ways to join and meet new people. There you have it. Save your money 
 The product was shipped to me in Moscow. After the first charge, I took it to university where it powered my notebook for two hours. Upon returning home and recharging the device, I discover that it will not turn on anymore. I suspect the battery is charging as the LED indicates this as it is connected to AC power. However, disconnecting it from any power source, it appears that the AC outlet and USB ports no longer function. The device gives no auditory signal or LED message, so I don't know if the built in inverter is out or something else is wrong with it. Either way, I'm left with a dead device that never supported charging from a 45 Watt solar panel anyway. I strongly suggest getting the battery from Tekkeon. Sorry about the bad review, but I had my hopes for this device as well. 
 Every English major has one writer who is responsible for their journey into the field.  I have two: Muriel Spark and Kurt Vonnegut.  I am not the kind of guy who walks around pretending to be a writer; I am no writer.  I  do, however, love to read about what makes writers tick, what inspires them  to write.  This is one of the reasons I picked up this tiny book--I hoped  it would give me some insight.  I didn't.       The conversations, at  times, are interesting.  But it wasn't worth the cash I shelled out for the  79 pages.  If this had of appeared in a magazine, I would have read it and  not whined.  If this had appeared in a magazine, I wouldn't have wasted  over 10 bucks 
 I think that one of the things about our society is that nowadays, if you do so much as rate a book regarding homosexuals (or a movie, such as Brokeback Mountain)-- if you give it a bad rating, people will call you a homophobe. I mean, come on. A bad book is a bad book. This book is a bad book. It was extremely short. The characters were virtually unlikeable and one-dimensional. You knew what was going to happen right from the beginning. It really just wasn't worth my time 
 I am all for the multi-dimensional character.  I found Garofalo's role promising in this.  She was interesting to watch and was pretty much believable.  Uma Thurman was ok too - a little less multi-dimensional but was lovable in a ditsy kind of way.  However, the guy picked for leading man was the pits.  Perhaps he is a good actor but you really can't tell from this movie.  What is it exactly . . . he, honestly, doesn't come across as being smart enough for Garofalo.  He's good looking to be sure but . . . boring.   I don't believe the movie the second he enters it.  I can see her falling for him initially but then getting tired of him because they have nothing to talk about.  It would have been much better if he wound up with Thurman and some really interesting leading man showed up or he turned out to be some con man or something.  There really was NO chemistry between them and that phone conversation . . .   I was frankly embarrassed for Garofalo.  I guess I didn't find her character believable in that.  This movie really misses the mark - I love the premise - but Garofalo needs a leading man as strong as herself.  I own the movie but doubt I will ever watch it again - I could sell it but I would feel like a peddler of shabby wares.  
 This book sucks..........Schwartz is impossible to read!  I tried to read The Living Energy Universe, and the Afterlife Experiments, which I could not finish....when a friend gave me the TRUTH to read I thought it would be lighter and more fun, but I was wrong, I could not finish it either.  Schwartz is definitely not a writer 
  Although there may be some good information in this book, it is difficult to extract due to the numerous fictional anectodotes.  A concept cannot even be expanded upon before some character such as Suzy Shrink or Caitlin Caterer (the alliteration is very annoying) is used in some senario in an attempt to highlight a tax concept. These little stories pop up 2 -3 times a page.  It makes for very frustrating reading if you are really trying to get answers.  And honestly, the alliteration just kills me.    
 Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and "traveling and learning" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city 
 I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.   
 I found the book "A Gathering of Days" interesting and filled with small pieces of history, but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read. The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me. 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 Straight up: Dip Set is garbage. This album is no exception, although in comparison to all the albums that they released, this is one of the better ones. Trufully, Cam'ron has very limited lyrical skills, and it displays throughout this album. Although during this time this album was released, he was just signed to Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records (you saw how long that lasted). Also around this time, some of the Dip Set artists (Jim Jones and Juelz Santana) were starting to surface. They themselves also weigh this album down. I did like the first single "Oh Boy". Also the second single "Hey Ma" was good also. The album's hugh highlight would be "Welcome To New York" featuring Jay-Z, that was well thought out.  The album also has many low points. A lot of these songs like "Loosing Weight 2" shows how very limited Cam'ron's skills are behind the mic. Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel do absolutely nothing for the song "The Roc". Production is good, like the Daz produced "Leave Me Alone", but Cam couldn't pull it together. Just Blaze and Kanye West would also toss in a few beats on this album also.  "Come Home With Me" is average at best. It has a few good songs and a lot of skip material. If you're used to hearing Cam on albums, then you might want to check this out for a few good tracks, or download it to hear how it sounds like. This isn't one I could fully get into.

 This is the most boring book I've read in the series! I've read all her books and I couldn't wait to finish this one. I can't believe I finished it in the first place! It has no plot and you can tell who did it very early in the storyline (if you want to call it a storyline). I wouldn't waste money buying this one. Get it from your library! The rumors about this one being ghostwritten have got to be true. I can't imagine Braun writing like this! 
 This book was incredably boring. Reading it felt like a miserable task. I almost feel like the author wrote in such a way to make themselves sound smarter. To be fair I only read half of it. It felt like such a chore to read I would have actually prefered to read transcripts from C-Span instead. 
 I bought this CD to use as background for a special Christmas Party being held for ex-pat Americans overseas.... when I ordered it, I tried the "listen" function to make sure White Christmas sounded right to me.... but I guess I did not read the reviews -- or I would have seen that bit about "radio dialogue" which is NOT in the product description.  I wanted the music, not the old time jokes!  It's hard enough to explain things in another culture!!! I was SO disappointed -- I'd only spent about $12, $6 for the CD and $6 for shipping -- but still..... 
 I've read several of Rita Mae Brown's Mrs. Murphy series, and enjoyed them, though I've always found her writing style a little annoying.   "I'll sniff around." (says Harry) "You've got a good nose." Bo's light eyes complemented his handsome features.   What in the heck do his eyes have to do with what he's saying? The book is full of such writing.   Anyway, this particular style has always been a little off-putting, but I've endured it because I like the characters in this series, especially the animals.   This entry, Sour Puss, however, was almost unreadable. I very rarely stop reading a book once I've started it, but I came very close with this one. I felt as if I were attending a bio-terrorism/grape-growing lecture. Boring! I didn't feel any interest at all in what happened until about the last fourth of the book. I get the distinct feeling that Brown is bored with her series and her characters. Maybe it's time to give them a rest.   I may or may not try another Mrs. Murphy book...I'm just glad I checked this one out of the library rather than purchasing it. 
 We read the book, The Chosen, by Chaim Potok, in my 10th grade English classes.  The students love the book, but the movie doesn't do it justice.  It skips parts that the students most wanted to see, and doesn't come close to the moving experience of the book.  The movie does provide a look at the cultural aspects of the book, including quite a few minutes of a Hasidic Jewish wedding, which is not part of the book.  I would not recommend the movie, however, unless you have read the book, which is an amazingly rich literary work, first 
 I usually read through one of Coulter's novel in a few days, exspecially her FBI/intrigue plots. I bought this as soon has it was released in paperback and still haven't finished it. The plot was slow and the main heroine a little too likable. Spoiler: Neighborhood teenagers diving on her body to protect her from bullets?! Talk about a work of fiction. No one expects a romance to be on our plane of reality, but in the same solar system would be nice 
 This is certainly as dry as a computer manual, so Microsoft could have included this as at least a PDF with PowerPoint. So did not do that and now they want you to buy this separately. That itself is reason to not buy this book and look at other alternatives.  My favorite others are:  How To Do Everything with PowerPoint 2003 Cutting Edge PowerPoint for Dummies PowerPoint 2003 Visual Quickstart Guid 
 i never even got this book because apparently its not a book yet amazons web site said it was. it took me 4 phone calls with 4 different customer service reps for some one to figure that out. all they gave me for the inconvenance was a 15 dollar amazon gift card which i tryed to use and doesn't work. i still don't have the book i needed and it is 4 weeks into the semester. i have baought other things from amazon and gotten them but this expeirance makes me never want to use amazon again. i would like to give you a review of the actual book but i never recieved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Rodney Dangerfield is supposedly becoming mormon(Church of Jesus Christ)  but this movie didn't get any fact right.  the church is never mentioned by name for a reason.  polygamy.  look like Amish.  a collection plate?  this movie stinks and i'm very offended 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 Am i the only real music left on this planet that thinks, no knows, that Janet CANNOT sing.  Don't get me wrong, very nice body, nice dancing, but her voice is garbage.  For that matter none of the Jacksons can sing, stop playing, keep it real 
 I found this book to be less informative than I thought it was going to be. I was hoping to see more of whats happened in Steinbeck's physche during his labor over The Grapes Of Wrath, but it doesnt really happen. This almost feels like he was asked to perform this task and he did it as an assignment rather than a labor of love. 
 This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!    Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting.  But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys!  Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!?  Never!  Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird.  Avoid this film today, folks! 
 To know the real John Money, read "As Nature Made Him" by John Colapint 
 I purchased this set only to find out when it arrived that the bowls are really too small for a realistic sized serving.   10-ounces to the brim is an exaggeration, they will hold about half a cup in real life 
 I've enjoyed the prior books in this series.  However, I found this one plodding, and too wrapped up in emotional melodrama and inner conflicts. While I've eagerly and quickly read through prior books, I've noticed that this one was an effort to finish.  Everyone has their own preferences, but less introspection and more action in the next book would be welcome 
 A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).   Ja tries to be "gangstafied" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single "Me & You" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track "F*** You" featuring Vita and 01?  Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song "Put It On Me" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song "Extacy" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when "Between Me & You" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.    Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. "6 Feet" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. "Watching Me" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. "I Cry" and as mentioned earlier "Extacy" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.  Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ("Put It On Me" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.

 I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good.  
 BORING.  I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book 
 This is a two-disc album with twelve music tracks per disc.  Let me get Disc 2 (The Riddler) out of the way first, because I can easily sum that up as being overall decent, with no stinkers, but no keepers either.  As for Disc 1 (Vic Latino), it's a wildly mixed bag which I will go into further detail about below:  The first thing I need to point out is the best track on this entire album, which is "You Won't Forget About Me (Original Extended Vocal Mix)" by Dannii Minogue vs. Flower Power.  The music is excellent, combining a great melody with a variety of instruments including guitar, orchestral strings, and the obligatory synths.  The lyrics are good, and the vocals play right into the melody, putting everything in perfect harmony.  But don't take my word for it, you can listen for yourself here: http://www.beatport.com/artist/Dannii+Minogue+vs+Flower+Power Amazon even has the single for sale (which I bought): http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006GTDMO/104-5537192-6282340?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance  The second thing I need to point out are the two worst tracks on this entire album, which are the amazingly terrible "Mamasita" by Flexy, and the incredibly lame "Just Move" by Ultra All-Stars.  Being that the problem stems directly from the infernal vocals, I hope the vocalists and lyric writers for these tracks die cold and lonely.  Other than that, there's not much to say about the Vic Latino disc.  "Lola's Theme" by Shape:UK is probably the second best track, due to the neat music, but it's kind of repetitive.  The rest of the tracks are more-or-less decent, but not worth mentioning.  I would give this album only a single star, but it gets a whole extra star just for including the Dannii Minogue vs. Flower Power track.  Go grab that single I mentioned, and avoid Ultra.Dance 6 at all costs 
 Just follow the money trail, the political bantering and incessant self-victimization (which always seems to lead into getting paid one way or another) and you'll see why the most powerful of the jewish lobby (yeah, I'm not afraid to say it) will still ENDORSE IT after it has been proven to be a complete fabrication.  And they wonder why the "extremists" have so much credibility even before people look at all the facts. I've read this book and got a great laugh out of the rediculous claims, and the writings of a man obviously an older version of someone whom would be on the Jerry Springer show today if faced with a different self-victimization issue.  I was already well informed this book was a fabrication in advance, so I can't say "I'm smarter than you all whom were fooled"...heck, even Elie "Weasel" fooled me the first two times around. Looks like his credibility is crap as well. I'mglad I have relatives that were on both sides of WW2; as camp munitions auditor, fitness/activity trainer (A Sergeant's job! He was denied citizenship in US but later came from Canada in about '80), a Luftwaffe infantryman whom both stayed at the conc camps, and himself taken POW when wounded in Belgium (yes many Luft Inf exist so stop emailing me, you don't know history) and a US liberator of Buchenwald...I'm glad REALITY doesnt match the whining stories of crybaby rich jews exiled after the war...so many millions of survivors all rubber-stamping eachothers stories about human soap and lampshades, all proven false by MAINSTREAM science. Like I said, follow the money trail.. 
 Most people who positively reviewed this book obviously read it feeling that this lifestyle is wrong, just like the author went into this book thinking what these girls are doing is wrong. Because of the fact her sex life is long gone she think it will die for these young girls as well if they have it all the time, well that is just not true. These girls are priming themselves and practicing for when they do want to get married,  they are so good at sex they do not have to look far.  Not only is this lifestyle good for their future husbands its good for teen pregnancy. As more teenagers have sex more and more get educated about it. All of you Pro Abstinence people out there asking "how is that?" Well let me introduce you to the world of statistics. I know, I know, religion forbids you from using science and statistics but lets have a look see anyway. Lets take Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. The birthrate of women below the age of 20 per 1000 for the united states is 52.1. The birth rate for Sweden and Switzerland is 6.5 and 5.5 respectively. Well are American teens having more sex then them? No is the answer to this question as 49 percent of US Teen women 18 and below are sexually active compared to 53 percent in the European countries. Now what is the most taught and funded contraceptive in the United States? You guessed it abstinence and prayer. Sweden and Switzerland? You guessed it Education, Birth Control, and Condoms. Wait Joe you mean they don't use make believe in Europe? Well no they don't its why they have a better economy then us.  She fails to see how sex helps these girls stay healthy. A recent Cornell University study found that women generally gain five to eight pounds in the first few years of marriage and unhappily married women gain an average of 54 pounds in the first 10 years. By not committing at an early age they do not gain pounds and ad to the obese country that is America.  I mean just by not letting these guys sleep over a survey conducted by the National Sleep Foundation, found that bed mate can cause you to lose an average of 49 minutes of sleep per night. At this point most of you are asking while physically not nearly as healthy as single women, married women must be more mentally healthy then single women, not so fast my friend listen to this. One report by the World Health Organization indicated that married women, especially ones with children, have a higher risk for depression than single women, and researchers at the University of London found that single women generally have fewer mental-health issues. "Marriage, in many ways, seems to benefit men more than women," says Davis. "For women, there's more of a loss of self." I am as shocked as you that even though every commercial and TV shows says that women HAVE to get married and should save themselves for this that they aren't happy because they never did anything they actually wanted to do. Again I am as shocked as you, morons.   Now what about social life? Married women have a life partner to share all of their experiences with, isn't this is what everyone wants? Wrong again my bible thumping friend. About everything. First lets touch on the social life aspect as again we look at a "study" and not just some garbage society pitches us. well the study found that, when women get married and have children, they spend much less time with their friends--less than five hours a week, down from 14 hours. Singles, however, often have the greatest sense of friendship and community--which can actually decrease stress levels, according to researchers at UCLA. Again as shocked as you that they would have a better sense of community, morons. Now as far as experiences go i cant deny that marrieds take the most vacations, dominating the market with 62 percent of all trips taken, but singles arguably go on more interesting trips. According to the Travel Industry Association of America, singles corner the adventure-travel market, engaging in activities like whitewater rafting, scuba diving and mountain biking. Being single and relatively footloose certainly allows you to expand your geographical -- and personal -- borders.  Now what allows them to do this? Money. According to researchers at Ohio State University's Center for Human Resource Research, during a divorce, men and women generally lose three-fourths of their personal net worth. we know that half of all marriages end in divorce so half of all marriages end with people losing 3/4 of there net worth. Meaning marriage is a gamble that favors the house, well no some scumbag.(I would feel comfortable in comparing a Casino to a Lawyer but when i think about the two I root for the casino and that's not good for anyone) in which you pay out 3/4 of your net income and who knows how much time. You don't have to justify your purchase to anyone but yourself. Once you mix money with marriage, though, things change--and fast. According to a survey by SmartMoney magazine, 40 percent of women and 36 percent of men have lied to their spouses about a purchase. So again waiting and getting married ends in 40 percent of lying and 50 percent losing 3/4 of there net worth. What are they better off doing now? going out and getting laid. I know if i just lost 3/4 of my net worth i would turn into a cougar and go sink my claws into some strapping young pray such as myself.  Which brings me to my final thoughts this book is about sex I wonder who has more sex? Well married people do but listen to this anyway. Married couples may have more sex (approximately 98 times a year vs. singles' 49), but singles have better sex. According to a recent study published in the British Medical Journal, married women are significantly more likely to report problems with their sex lives than single women. Wait married women who get to have great unprotected sex are unhappy with their own sex lives. Really? Is that true Joe you are asking right now? Why yes yes it is which is in my mind the reason this book was written Laura Stepp doesn't get laid nearly as much as she should and she has to take it out on someone. Well if you need a good lay I know where you can find one right here. Because trust me i won't tell your husband because all i want to do is "hook up" with you 
 This is another in a long history of books written by blind men describing the elephant's trunk. Other great books and essays in this tradition include "Free to Choose" by Milton and Rose Friedman, "The Law" by Frederick Bastiat, and "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt. All these books are quite good at describing the trunk (or a tree), but miss the elephant (or the woods) in the process.  For what it covers, it is a fine book.  However, Sowell forgets to apply all of his principles to the most influential business organization in the market, the corporation. The corporation has the perpetual life, limited liability and personhood. The qualities of limited liability and personhood could not be reproduced without government intervention in the market. Yet, limited liability and personhood are ignored so that he can focus on rent control or price controls. Are rent controls really more important to the economy than a corporation?  Before the libertarians and conservatives that are reading this get their [...] bunched over a corporation being able to be created without government intervention, think about a third party being hurt by a corporate action. If a corporation mistakenly dumps toxic waste on land that you own then goes out of business, who is responsible? Answer: No one. You made no contract with the offending corporation, neither explicitly nor implicitly. You are left paying for the mistake that others made because the government granted limited liability (or limited irresponsibility) to corporate investors.  Is limited liability so trivial that it can be ignored? If yes, then let's get rid if it. No more limited liability. If no, why doesn't Sowell explore the unintended consequences of this government intervention?  I suggest you take Sowell's advice and think about the secondary and tertiary consequences of corporate limited liability and personhood. Now that could make a good book. Does limited liability change incentives? Does the gathering of capital through limited liability have an impact on political campaigns and lobbying (and through lobbying, changes in the law)?  This book is just more stuff, on a pile of stuff that was better written 
 I cannot give a review of the entire book, as I have only read one of the short stories contained in it.  I read the one entitled, "Rumpole of the Younger Generation."  I felt like I was wasting my time, because  all I was reading was a synopsis of a former triumph of this man.  The case  might have been exciting, but the author did not play fair, and the guilty  party was obvious.  I did not like this story very much, and can only hope  that the rest of them are better than this one was 
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 This was given to my 2 year old as a present.  It is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart.  The roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with.  The concept is good, all the animals and farmer are built very well, but it's frustrating to me and my son that it won't stay together. 
 I laughed out loud multiple times reading this book, which is why it took a while for me to realize that "funny lines do not a good book make." The plot is far fetched, the characters are superficial, the "erotica" is crass and amateurish, and the ending is absurd. It barely qualifies as a good beach read, and I felt like I needed a bath upon finishing it. I gave it two stars for the humor. But really--dumb, dumb, dumb 
 I usually like Tami Hoag's books, she is a story teller with a surprising twist. The twist was there this time also. However,the characters were way too predictable. They all seemed on the dark side, even the "heroes." Surely there has got to be a non-divorced person in this world. Not in her book. Well, unless you are the guy who kills people because they're in the way. Then you can be single and never married.  The bad guys had no redemptive features -- too cartoon-like.   And the unnecessarily bad language was a turn-off. Surely even in cop land not every one uses the f... word in every sentence.  The plot was somewhat interesting but felt undeveloped, kind of like the characters.  Of course tastes differ. I like a bit more psychological depth with my murders than Tami Hoag offers in this story. Maybe next time 
 I rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and couldn't get past it don't waste your time or patience with this annoying game 
 I'm no prude, but some of the actions described in this book go beyond crude to disgusting and repulsive.  Who needs to waste time reading about such behavior?  Don't we see enough of the depths of human depravity on the news? I would have expected a huge protest from families of middle class black people, who are portayed with every variety of perversion and obsession...the only ones who are shown as decent human beings are strange in their own ways, nonformist to the extreme. 
 Once again Wiesel completes another masterly, tear-jerking hoax. How much longer can this phoney get away with it 
 Another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation... If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers. like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it.... It is a living. When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc.... I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad... 
 I recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because I need something to occupy my mind while I scan microfiche at work (boooorrring). I actually haven't finished this book yet, but up until what I listened to tonight, I hadn't made my mind up yet on how I felt about it. I was going to see it though, but now I'm not sure if I will.  I don't even know where to start about what I don't like about this book.  Before starting this book, Ms. Picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings, especially proceedings following such a great span of time. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about law, but it seems quite unrealistic that Delia's father Andrew Hopkins (or should I say Charles Matthews?) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week. I find it hard to believe that on his first day, he would get beaten and practically raped (I can't remember if he was or not). I could be wrong, but if 28 years have passed, wouldn't the statute of limitations passed, and even if they hadn't, wouldn't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen? And wouldn't it mean something that they were in a different state?  Now, even though everyone else seemed to love her, Delia was incredibly annoying (and the actress who read her "monologues" in the audio version was equally annoying). Women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her. I have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men, but rarely ever do. It just seems like a fantasy of Picoults, and a very boring one at that. Ah, a love triangle, gee, like THAT's never been done before. One instance that sticks out is when Delia gets upset that Eric (her fiancee and her fathers attorney) doesn't tell her about a court appearing, however, Eric didn't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen. But, even the premise for that is questionable: would that really happen? I mean seriously!  I also hated how the book shifted "voices" -- this is not a play, I don't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective. I didn't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters. I half expected a chapter to be from Sophie (Delia's four year old daughter) perspective. I could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore. I also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense, and then later incorporated into the passage, also not making sense. For example, Eric narrates this dream he had about Sondra, who is some beautiful girl he imagined. She turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush. Later, Ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up. Somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit, when really they have no cohesive connection. Also, between the three childhood friends (Delia, Eric and Fitz) they talk about their memories constantly, as if that is the only thing that binds them together. Real friendships don't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past... but it does in this book, because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends. To me, it just seems pretentious.  What's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all. One passage I remember is when Delia is talking to Fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born, and maybe they remember things that never happened to them. I might have that a little wrong, because it's a bit confusing. It's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't even feel like it's remotely TRYING to make sense at all! The book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual, like Picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical.  All of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases. Delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was FOUR YEARS OLD. For goodness sakes woman, I have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when I was four years old or younger, and most of them don't make sense except for the fact that I know what my parents have told me. By the way she acts, you'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped.  Also, she seems to recover memories all the time... man, I wish I could do that. It just seems a bit implausible, that's all.  The book is saturated in gooey, sappy imagery, metaphors, anecdotes, memories, subplots, and so on. I am not so quick to totally bash an author, but it's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that I loathe. If I wanted some sappy, melodramatic dimestore paperback I would have read one of those instead. I expected better from the synopsis on the back cover. Overall, and I say overall without even finishing the book (I haven't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet, but it sounds pretty ridiculous), that this is definitely one of the most horrible books I've ever read, bar none. Do yourself a favor and skip this one... and definitely don't pick up the audiobook. The voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to 
 Andre Norton and Rosemary Edghill's _Leopard in Exile_ is the sequel to _The Shadow of Albion_, which I thought was rather entertaining. Sadly, _Leopard in Exile_ is not. The world's magical structure is poorly worked out; it's a mishmash of elements from British faery lore, Native American beliefs, Satanistic black magic, and even Arthurian legend (the Holy Grail). The plot is absurdly contrived, the alternate history unconvincing (why would the American colonies under the Stuarts be more friendly to the native Americans than they were under Hanoverian rule?), and the characters poorly fleshed out. There's almost nothing of the relationship between Wessex and Sarah which was forged in the first book, just a lot of agonizing about how much they love each other, with very little interaction between them which shows rather than tells. Wessex's desperate search for Sarah, who has gone to the New World to help her friend Meriel, is a driving force behind much of the plot, but as there seems to be no depth to their relationship, it's next to impossible to feel any urgency about the search.  And worst of all, the narrative includes footnotes, which are very difficult to use effectively in fiction without distracting the reader from the flow of the action; here, they are overly self-conscious, frequently patronizing (the note explaining the bill which abolished slavery in Britain and its dominions ends "Aren't you glad I'm here to tell you these things?"), often useless (defining a recaumier as "A couch to you", when it's clear from the context anyway), and generally aggravating. Do we really need a reference to a web site about jambalaya when it's served to one of the characters? Surely not. I cannot imagine what the authors (or their editor) could have been thinking to include these idiotic, distracting notes.  I still think _The Shadow of Albion_ was worth reading, but by all means, avoid the sequel. (Hey, and I didn't even mention the gratuitous Star Wars reference or the meaningless appearance of a character from one of Edghill's other books - duly noted in the footnotes, of course). 
 I was looking for a miracle cure and this fell just short of the mark. My little guy hated riding in the car so I thought if I could lull him to sleep then I could get my errands done. He just cried over the music. If you are going to have to listen to this cd yourself just know that the lyrics are a little different then the ones I remember and they heart beat track drowns them out at times. When the car idea didn't work I tried to use the cd after breastfeeding and/or before bed. However, it didn't work at home either. In the end his Fisher-Price Natures Touch Cradle Swing was our lifesaver. Even when we had trouble getting him back to sleep after late night feedings. To those Moms suffering from sleepless nights I hope you find what works for you 
 While the book was plentiful of wild, sensual fantasies, I was disappointed in some of them.  Many were hard to believe even for fantasies and many sounded like they were written by illiterates.  If you're looking  for this type of book, I strongly recommend "Women on Top" 
 All countries have their fairy tails, myths, and legends. They are unique to the country from which they originated. They give a mystical history, and tell why some things happed they way they did. The people of Egypt worshiped many gods and they told many stories about them. Tales of Ancient Egypt by Roger Lancelyn Green, is a collection of these stories In Egyptian stories one of the most important gods was Ra. He was the first pharaoh of Egypt and ruled for thousands of years. After those thousands of years went by Ra, got older, but he refused to give up the throne. The story of "Ra and his Children" is about one of his daughters tricking him into making a poisonous snake bite him, and then making him give up the throne and become the sun god.   While Ra ruled the skys the the Duat was the land of the dead. When a person died he or she went to the Daut where they went through the twelve gates and on to immortal life. One story tells of how Se-Orsisis and his father, Prince Setna, visited the land of the dead. They traveled into the land of the dead for twelve hours, and witnessed the trials and sufferings of the wrongdoers who were sent to the Apophis the terrible pit of fire. In the world of the living the sole was The Nile. Everywhere people depended on the rivers annual rising to make the harsh dessert land fertile for the growing of crops. If The Nile did not rise one year, the people of Egypt suffered from lack of food. These years were called lean years. When Zoser was pharaoh, Egypt suffered from seven consecutive lean years. Desperate, Zoser sent out for a wise man to tell him what he could to do make the lean years stop. The wise man told him that he must got to the cave of Khnemu, the god of The Nile. When Zoser reached the cave, Khnemu told him that the only way the lean years would stop would be to make annual offering to him. After the pharaoh made the offering the lean years stopped. Subsequently the people of Egypt never once stopped giving offerings to the god of The Nile.  There are stories of love too. "The Tale of Two brothers" is about a farmer who married a women,  who was the daughter of the gods. Eventually the pharaoh fell in love with her and she ran away to marry him. The farmer went to find her and bring her back to him. The pharaohs wife was so scared she tried to kill the farmer three times, and three times he survived. In the end, she died and the farmer became pharaoh. Another love story is a Cinderella story, but in Egypt it is called "The girl with the red-rose slippers". Instead of being named Cinderella the girl was named Rhodopis, she was not a servant but a slave sold to a rich merchant who spoiled her.  The author of Tales of Ancient Egypt Roger Lancelyn Green wrote short stories. He seems to have researched them first and then writen them, maybe adding or taking away. Most of the stories are around five pages so I think that he likes writing short stories. I didn't really like Tales of Ancient Egypt because there wasn't a main story. I like reading books partly because you get to know a character and you are in their word while you read. With this book, there were short stories all stuck together; sometimes the same characters are mentioned a few times in other stories, like Ra. But reading this book was a good way for me to learn more about Egypt. 
 The writer used to many big words making the book very hard to understand. The book was very hard to read and impossible to understand. This book was not written for the average reader.  
 Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly" 
 I liked the book. The mix of explanations of the painting and his life was very descriptive. I learned a lot about his friends and famliy. The book just reminds me that in every genius there's a lunatic 
 There is some good writing in this book, but it is limited to about 100 pages out of 600 pages.  The main character, Alex Hawke, excuse me I mean Lord Alex Hawke, is a magical combination of James Bond, Austin Powers, Batman and Superman--he can do it all...around the world in a day.  He is friends with the President of the US, he's a British Lord called on to rescue a hostage from the Chinese, rescue the Sultan of Oman from a fortress, rescue NYC from a nuclear bomb, fly a $50 million stealth jet on loan from the USA to a US aircraft carrier.  Apparently the US Navy Seals, US pilots, etc don't exist in this book, as the Pres of the US, the CIA, Scotland Yard, etc rely solely on Lord Hawke to save the world.  Hawke is apparently in his young 30's too.  In the book, there is also the ego-maniacal descendant of Napoleon who murders his way to the top of the French Government.  There is also the Chinese version of Hannibal Lecter who is an assassin and total freak, The German industrialist Neo Nazi who are all scheming to take over the world.  They all meet with anti-climatic ends.  And of course Sir Alex Hawke gets the girl, a beautiful Chinese spy, actress, singer, diva, etc who, after one night with Sir Hawke, betrays her country, kills her evil twin sister, almost kills her father, betrays her ex-boyfriend, helps Hawke's friend Stokley, the 6'5 260lb ex Jets running back who sneaks into all of the enemies' lairs to help Hawke save the world.  The tone of the book varies from life and death serious to total tongue in cheek; it makes me think that even the author doesn't believe what he's writing.  Bell's new one is on the best seller list.  I guess that is what marketing can do for you 
 There is not one "Sports Blooper" or any kind of "blooper" on this dvd.  There is no basketball playing at all.  Just a couple of old basketball players playing practical jokes on other basketball players.  And none of them are funny.  Just stupid.  Don't waste your money.  Sorry, I had to give it one star to get the review accepted - otherwise I would not 
 The title of this book is very intriguing and the subject of learning how to improve communication skills when things are rough is very compelling.  I was astonished and very dissapointed with the author's approach - so much so, that I was not able to make it past page 35.  I would not have made the expenditure had I known that the author created a platform for her philosophy of relationships.  Had that been my interest at the time, there are far more interesting treatises on the subject.  I rate this book as a 1 because there isn't a lower number 
 What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
 I agree with a previous review that you get what you pay for.  But in the future I would highly recommend paying more once instead of having to replace this food in a few months or so.  We received this as a gift and from the outside it looked like an great choice!  I was very happy.  But we have had this package of food for about one week and I am already taping boxes with packaging tape to keep them together.  Little hands can pull apart the milk, juice and snack boxes in no time.  The cans of food are so small that they topple over easily in the play kitchen.  The pies, pizza, and such food are all actually hollow underneath.  There is no base to them.  They tell you 101 pieces but in our kit it counted 8 hotdogs (without buns), 12 individual french fries and the same on potato chips.  Not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets in a french fry container and you get a hot dog in a bun separately.  Why would my child want four jalepenos too.  So much of this food is not they type of thing a small child would be familiar with.  Anyway, in my opinion spend the money on a smaller quantity of higher quality food or go online and find the "vintage" Fisher Price or Little Tikes food.  Now those are made to last and of good size for small hands.  
 As a climatologist, i was quite intrested to read this book. After finising it, i was quite dissapointed. The author misrepresents science in every page. HE takes a complicated issue, and confuses the lay-man with his jargon. IT is a pity such intellectually dishonest books are allowed to be written 
 Personally I have found the format of the book difficult to read and follow, which gets in the way of the knowledge contained therein. I am a fan of headings, bullets, tables, boxes etc (high visual impact) - and this book does NOT use this in a clear fashion. Apart from this, the actual information presented (the little I have read) is thorough.  Maybe a second edition will tidy up 
 I purchased this car for our three year-old granddaughter.  Within the first ten minutes one of the seats moved and we were not able to put it back in place.  I would not purchase this product again.  
 This author has one heck of a writing style. It's all over the place!  He appears to be a well informed guy, but he's very hard to follow. He uses lots of dashes, parentheses, and notes about other chapters. Plus, there are many overuses of words such as "insofar" and "per se," which disrupt the entire flow of reading. It is not what I expected at all and am pretty disappointed 
 Okay, so this book isn't THAT bad, but there are better organization books that take a little longer to implelement but work much better in the long run.  I recommend that teenagers should instead read the FlyLady cleaning book and use the control journal idea in conjunction with this book to keep their room clean.  They must devise their own system and that takes a lot of time and trial and error, but this book won't solve all of the organization problems, it needs more.  Trust me, I am 15, I spend about 10 minutes a day keeping my room neat, and it is always perfect.  I also have tons of time for everything I want to do 
 This CD, in nice terms, is a piece of junk.  If you already bought Bad Boy's 10th anniversary Hits collection, you don't need this. Some of the songs are the same... and most of the other one's you probably already own. For the most part the songs that are on it are great Rnb Classics, but the CD is a short 12 songs, and doesn't even remotely encompass BadBoy's RnB Hits. The Dvd is even worse, only having 7 videos on it. Save your money and Buy BadBoy's 10th Anniversery: The Hits instead 
 Hannity is always on top of his game by winning the conservative lie fest on Fox news time after time. Move over OReilly 
 Ms. Tiwari may have a fascinating story, but while she tells people not to look to the past or the future in order to live within the moment, she painstaking details how one should get in touch with their anscestral roots in order heal. The dysfunction of her early childhood, (her father had two wives), and her race to become famous as a young woman, (bouncing from choices of lawyer, to actress, to fashion designer,) left me wary of her philosophy of change. She lost me completely when, after being diagnosed with cancer, she describes seeing a vision of the Divine Mother swathed in bright light and then the vision of a bluebird, (the Divine Mother in disguise), asking her to fly out of her manhattan apartment window. She is stopped from leaping to her death by being again being bathed in white light, (i guess from the Divine Mother). For a woman trying to give "practical" advice to healing, a found this smacking of snake oil 
 This worked for only a couple days. Although the belt/pocket clip held my Treo securely, it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way. After a cople of days, the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time...after a couple more days it was useless.  Save your money on this one.. 
 i saw these guys live at a ludacris/rufio/walkman/phantom planet concert and i seriously wanted to shoot myself.  not only do i hate girl rock bands to begin with, the singer was so annoying. their performance in general was just really really bad, i mean the girl playing the keyboard looked like she just wanted to die.  they kept playing more and more songs, more than all the other bands, it was like a nightmare that wouldn't end.  her voice is annoying, no range or style whatsoever, the music has nothing going for it.  if u're into courtney love and all that crud, u may like this, otherwise bail on this one 
 I would have left this book in the airline seat back on my way to the exit.  I anticipated the follow-up to the first Frankenstein novel and wasn't disapointed by the intensity or unique spin on an old story.  But, and maybe this happens with novelists who write so many stories, I couldn't help thinking that a lot of this I had seen before. For example:  1) Plucky girl cop and wisecracking boy cop sidekick. Didn't we see this in Dragon Tears?  2) Endless knocks on contemporary American society. OK Mr. Koontz, we get it, the modern world is bad. We're sorry. We promise to try harder. We saw all of this most recently in The Face and the Odd Thomas series.  3) Angelic autistic child (or child with some other disability). The Seize the Night series, From the Corner of his Eye, and a lot of other books I can't seem to remember.  4) Tortured priest who struggles with an end times calamity and the changes that are happening to his body and psyche.  But wait, there is at least a bonus! No thinking super dogs that can save the universe if we all just hugged them more.  Koontz tends to go over the top when he talks about contemporary times. Really Mr. Koontz, we're not that bad. This moralizing detracts from the pacing and quality of his work and I wish he would stop.   The third Frankenstein book is probably going to be the last Koontz book I will read. While I like most of the characters he's created, and think many of his story lines are interesting, I am tired of being preached at and lectured to.  Reader tip: I've noticed on long driving trips that Koontz novels sound better in audio than they do when read 
 The book seems to be more for scoring political points rather than genuine scholarship. The first line in the description says it all - "A book the government of India demands be ritually burned". The BJP led govt. is "demanding" and book to be burned, but "hasn't". While individual members in the BJP govt. are entitled to their own opinion, the govt as a whole hasn't made a policy of banning it. The Allahbad high court (which is totally different than the BJP led govt) has on grounds of hurting public sentiment. Which means this book is banned via the valid legal process.  This book is a publicity stunt and rehash of the work done by other renowned authors/historians previously 
 Although the book boasts what seems as an interesting approach, it rarely lives up to the idea of cross-breeding geography with studies of the Internet. I found myself lost in endless rants on what can now be assumed to be common wisdom (i.e. explanations and definitions of the www, e-mail, usenet, etc.). Furthermore, I have found a lot of typos, which I find not only sloppy, but simply disgusting given the price of the book. Methodologically the book seems very rich, but it fails to elaborate thorougly on issues. An example of the latter would be the chapter on cyberspace, which quotes many authors being of relevance to the study of cyberspace, but how exactly is not thorougly discussed, it is merely mentioned.   On a more theoretical level, I find the authors' emphasis on spatiality intriguing, but not as relevant as they pose it is. I strongly disagree with their virtual / actual distinction, which can only clutter theoretical discussions on the implications of cyberspace on our lives. I fail to see why people still metaphysically dichotomize the so-called 'real world' with the digital world. Sure, there are differences, but who would disagree networked information technologies have an impact on us?  Just what the future of cartography / geography will be remains extremely shady and mysterious. Sad but true 
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.    
 In the early going, I thought the choice was between four and five stars.  As the movie progressed, my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four, so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second.  The ending was so disappointing that I had to drop my rating to two stars.  It is about a Polish man in France who marries a French girl but is divorced by her because he is unable to make love to her.  He returns to Poland without her, manages to get rich, and comes up with a plot to get revenge on his beloved Dominique.  The problem with this writing is that he loves her, so why is he plotting revenge against her?  It is senseless.  The ending is utterly surreal.  She should hate him for what he has done to her, but she is smiling to him.  He is looking at her and crying.  He has betrayed her in a cruel way.  He doesn't have the right to be crying for her.  That is like Hitler crying for the Jews.  He is still in a position to help her out, but he won't.  It's really pretty sickening.  The story becomes unclear enough as it is, without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss.  It left me angrily saying "What the hell is going on?"  I really hate it when a director becomes unclear and plays with the audience.  I don't find that cute at all.  Tell the damn story and tell it clearly.  Besides, the ending sucks 
  I got this magazine as a gift, starting a few months back.  I really can't say I'm impressed.    Admittedly, I'm much more left leaning than this conservative (sometimes very, very conservative) magazine.  Dispite my bias, I can still recognize good writing and well made points - this magazine generally lacks both.  This isn't to say that I've never seen a good point or anything, they're just fairly rare.  If you want to read a well-written, well-argued, conservative mag this isn't it 
 If you want to take a ride to the 70s in a time machine, this is the vehicle for you. Do your dog a favor, though, and leave him right where he is, since Millan's 'philosophy' of dog/human relationship management really won't be doing him much good.  If you're a big fan of the old school's outmoded alpha rolls, or truly believe your dog is trying to dominate you while he's cruising the counter looking for cookies, then you'll probably enjoy this book a great deal. If you do choose to buy this, you'll get a lot of the author's biography and his own personal 'science' (that bears little or no resemblance to any accepted science in the realms of learning theory, dog training or behavior). What you WON'T get is much information on dog training, or much useful advice on how to fix any kind of dog behavior or dog/human relationship problems.   Complex issues like separation anxiety rate a couple of paragraphs, heavily vested in making sure the dog is exercised to exhaustion at all times. While I'm sure a dog that's physically depleted all the time is much easier to handle, I'm not sure how many of us actually have the ability to incorporate 6 hours of daily strenuous dog exercise into our already crowded lives. And besides, what role does an exhausted, 4-legged zombie fill in your family circle?   The human/dog bond has evolved for thousands of years as a richly textured relationship deserving of a great deal more consideration than Millan's 'fast-food' analysis would suggest. Your money would be better spent elsewhere...  
 More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff 
 Man, I don't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but it should be illegal!  This is, first off, a terrible DVD: 4:3 (full screen) format, with a dark, muddy picture.  Worse, the plot is typical, predictable, and poorly written.  Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.  That is probably the fault of the director, Erik Anjou, a third-rate director (at best!) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary.  Gee, I wonder why he isn't in more demand (NOT!)!  I can enjoy "B" movies, and bad movies, but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at.  I can't imagine that this mess was released on DVD for any reason other than to cash in on Teri Hatcher's current popularity, and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger (29 year-old) Teri Hatcher nude.    Rent this, if you must, but, wow, there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad 
 I should have bought my girls ipods.  Yes, these mini-muddles are cute in that they fit into little girl purses and pockets, but that's where the novelty ends.  First, it is NOT abundantly obvious to children how to work the controls to get where they want to be.  These are kids for crimy sakes!  They needs to have controls that are clear and easy.  My youngest has no idea how to get to a particular song because the buttons never do what she THINKS they should do (That's a big hint to Hasbro...don't design a product from an adults point of view.  Design it for a child from their point of view.  A button having multiple functions is very confusing for kids).  So I end up having to constantly mash those itty-bitty buttons until I can figure out where the song is for her.  Second, the process of getting music from point A to point B (point B being the mini-black-hole) is NOT a quick and easy process.  Copy here, burn there, transfer to this spot, drag/drop to who knows where.  Oy vey.  And THEN you discover the music isn't in the correct format so you have to start all over again.  As for the 128 worth of space...128 is a piddly amount of space but it is clearly advertised on the packaging that this is the amount you're going to get.  No surprises there.  Now if I could only get the darn music into the player without giving up and chuckin' it to the dog to play with.  An ipod might be expensive, but Apple certainly doesn't cause this consumer the grief and frustration that Hasbro has 
 Not very good selections from the series I watched as a kid. Thr students in my class got bored of them after a few minutes 
 The only nice piece is Amarantine. The rest of the songs are very boring and lost some of Enya's "magic" 
 I thought that this book was very harsh and critical of some groups of people.  I thought that it was quite insulting to men and whites.  I thought it was well writtten, and i loved the first couple sections about  Walker's ideas of activism rooted in love, but i found that as the book  progressed it seemed to become more of a praise of certain kinds of people  rather than praising all people and loving all people like it was claimed  earlier in the book.  Overall, Walker had good ideas, I just found that  sometime they were expressed in a manner of insult 
 Like all the Haynes T-shirts except the 50/50, these bunch at the back of the neck. Try another brand 
 This movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting.  I found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying 
 Not  a profound book. Lots of story-telling to make a few good points. A fast and fun read. 
 I am writing this review after hearing a lengthy discussion of this book by the author and sevreal critics on a radio show.  I have not read the book.  My basic comment is that this person does not seem interested in simple, rational logic.  He repeatedly gathered all good qualities recognized by people under the rubric "manly" and then asserted that any good qualities women are seen to have are not manly.  Why not?  Because women have them.  So, he has developed a metaphysical quality called "manliness" to which he attaches all goodness.  A simple example was provided when a critic cited examples of female courage, such as the ferocity with which women will defend their children, failing no sacrifice for them.  Well, that's not the same as manly courage, it seems.  Women won't "step out in front" to defend others.  THAT'S manly!  Of course, in a society during the past centuries of which women were not allowed to take leadership roles in the military or the government, how would they display this virtue?  No matter, the circumstances prove his argument.  And so it goes on 
 A very broad list of questions with high level answers. I wouldn't buy this book if I were looking for a deep framework to handle this topic 
 I admire Cicero and and I like THE NATURE OF THE GODS, but I give it 2 stars because of the poor translation, which renders a lucid book intolerably boring. So, please throw away the PENGUIN edition and check out the same title by OXFORD WORLD'S CLASSCIS translated by P.G.Walsh. After you have compared the two editions, you will realize the weakness of J.M.Ross' translation 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 This product replaces a 5 gig Creative Micro which had a hard drive and broke at 1 year after a minor drop.  The Zen V is easier to download.  The 2 gig space allows me to hold up to 5 audiobooks and some music.  The battery is lasting about 10 hours. Sound quality is better than the Micro I appreciate former comments about the unit will not lose its place if the unit is shut down while playing rather than hitting the pause/stop button, which will start at the beginning of the book or song.   I had a few encounters with the unit freezing up.  I can control the frequency  of freezes by allowing the unit to "think" after I touched a button or control.  It's a little slow to respond to the commands.  If I'm pressing a button more than once or hitting the back button command to get into the system controls, I wait until the unit gets to the window that I want before telling the unit what to do. No freezing 
 The idea is good, but there just doesn't seem to be enough suction power...unless you want to spend 5 or 6 hours vacuuming your fish tank.   I have a small 10 gallon tank.  I keep it very clean.  I use all the chemicals and additives to keep the water clear and free from odor.  I change the water every couple of months, so it shouldn't take me forever and a day to vacuum the gravel once a month...but it does 
 The author apparently makes a living out of writing one retirement book  after another and constantly revising those already written. This in itself  wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact most of the information  presented is less than thorough and comprehensive, and in many cases it is  downright misleading.  Buy it if you must but don't expect too get much  useful information from it 
 The first part of the book is unbearably slow,  the gender differences of boys and girls are painstakingly boiled down into a litany of "boys excel at..., girls excel at.  The list that everybody has heard, sports and spatial tasks = boys,   penmanship, language skills = girls.   The saving grace of this book is that in the 2nd part the author mentions what should actually be done.   Michael Gurian, author/ educator, also has a few pilot projects being run in the state of Missouri. The results sound encouraging.  He encourages teachers to start catering to the needs of both genders in the class. He stresses that to do this teachers will need training.  As for parents the usual "be a concerned and supportive parent" is always added.  I was generally unimpressed with the book, no real blockbusters. The real world results of his pilot education programs were to me the issue that maybe the author was onto something. Hopefully if it is as good as its portrayed this method will gain some notoriety. 
 Where the hell is the melody, the song? Just fragments of invention that rarely gel into a work of art. I think Wayne is playing the role of Miles, but has not controled his men in the same way. -think I'm crazy? Listen and judge. j 
 I expected more from this book based on the reviews that I read before buying it. Although it has some good information about what specific muscles jobs are, the illustrations are not clear enough for good understanding. As an artist specifically working with the human form I find this book very mickey mousey and incomplete. If you already have all the books ever created on human anatomy that are needed to put together the information that is required to have a comprehensive knowledge on how the human body is constructed and moves then get this to finish your collection, but if you are looking for a clear understanding and accurate information on human anatomy for the artist look elswhere 
 This book was too predicatable, I could see the plot coming miles ahead. A big dumb tough guy goes up against a bunch of bad guys and cops, and he doesn't even have a gun, all he has is his muscles and a strong tolerance for pain. You knew Goldie would turn out to be a hooker, and if that's a spoiler for you. You need to read more fiction and/or watch more sopa operas. The characters aren't that complex, rather two-dimensional and to make matters worse, Miller doesn't even give a twist in the plot. For the record, there have been a number of people who claim to work for God that has done evil deeds for there own selfish purposes. The Crusades for one. So, Miller you don't get any points from me on that one. Now for those of you that are saying. "Hey it's only a comic book, a big one but a comic nonetheless." I say, "That is BULLL!!" Read: watchmen, The Judas Contract, Future Imperfect, and The League part one and two. Oh and Elfquest and then tell me if a comic book can't be well, this no story piece of crap 
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 One of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other. Genius! Not. The result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other. grrr...    One more thing, only the screen is protected by a clear plastic. The wheel is not 
 This novel deserves 5 stars.  I was given 44 Scotland Street as a Christmas gift. I assumed it was a "detective story" given the author's previous well known work. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was like nothing else I have ever read.  I have lived in Scotland and have visited Jenner's department store in Edninburgh, as well as some of the other landmarks mentioned in the book. I can assure readers who have not been to Edinburgh that the descriptions and the characterizations are very real, for example, the rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow.  Although it may be difficult for non-Scots to fully appreciate certain elements of the book, the characters can be found practically anywhere and in any time. For example, the narcissistic Bruce and the class-conscious Sasha. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and especially homesick Scots.  I can hardly wait for the sequel 
 This book is NOT everything you need to interface your PC with outside devices.  Like most of Myke Predko's books it is full of filler material and misrepresented.  It does contain lots of interesting information about computer interfacing, but no useful information to get you started on your own.  I am very dissapointed with Predko's books and feel that he writes to sell books and not primarily to educate and inform 
 We loved Murphy's "Henry the Fourth", but we didn't particularly like this book.  While the artwork is delightful, the rhymes are clumsy, and worse, the premise just is not very interesting.  At least, finding out what happened to the cow's utter-mittens did not engage my kids (almost 3 and 5).    On the plus side, the book did give my almost 5 y.o. and myself a place to start talking about even and odd.  And the way that the artist showed the pairs of mittens and the missing mitten in outline made it easy to point out what the story was taking about.    But I'd give this book a pass unless you are desparate to find an edutainment introduction to even/odd numbers 
 I heard the only good song on the CD, and purchased it. I should have tried a few more, it's not worth the price 
 The amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread, yet subtle, socialist movement in America as well as in Europe.  Despite this, the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality.  Rawls commits one of the many age-old flaws of collectivism, attempting to force morality on immoral beings. Rawls' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies, selectively allows certain knowledge, assumptions, etc. while conveniently eliminating others.  For instance, empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems cannot be known in the original position.  This is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative.  Thus, capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy.  If we compare the human condition prior to capitalism, one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism's downfall is immoral, if it leads us back in this direction.  Consequentalism perhaps?  Despite this, the people in the original position cannot have this knowledge.  Therefore, information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world cannot be used in determining its structure.  Somehow though, the people do understand the important of the right to vote, equality, etc. This is absurd and impractical.  Rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make.  Rawls continuously attempts to explain his "tweaks" as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms.  On a side note, Rawls' first principle calls for the right to vote, what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his "justice"?  Iron fist?  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious what Rawls is attempting here.  In a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence, strength, status etc. we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods.  This may be true, or it may not (human nature seems to embrace risk taking) however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information.  Hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical Natural Condition.  While Rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice, this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world.  Essentially, what Rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent, responsible, hard working, but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery.  Because of this arbitrary distribution, he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent, lazy, and perhaps even immoral!  I'd admonish Rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system (Poor, unfortunate murderer).  If Rawls believes that the laziest, dumbest, and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working, he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery, forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation.  This simply cannot be justice as "fairness".  Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions.  As a warning however, be prepared for a work that lacks brevity, organization, coherence, and most importantly, reality 
 This had a great summary to look forward to. It didnt deliver one bit, I was really creeped out that this stupid lady would take her child back to the place where she was violently raped and beaten just to get revenge. This is a case of ultra neo feminism where your pride takes precident over your childs well being. Skip this book and take your kids out to a park instea 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 The fact that the author has been working for Microsoft and that he managed to get a foreword written by Jeffrey Richter do a good marketing job, but the book is disappointing.  No issue is treated in detail, and instead too many obvious remarks are provided (such as "Test the product fully before shipping..." or "No hardware is allowed to enter or leave the build lab without a team member's okay").  The only valuable idea is the so called Virtual Build Lab, which is nothing more than a separate codeline for a sub-project, which is merged to the real mainline only when it is stable enough. This idea comes naturally in big sized projects.  Berczuk book on Software Configuration Management is by far a much better choice.  
 This book covered a lot of what was not on the MPRE, and very little of what was.  After studying the book, I aced the practice MPRE that was provided.  I went into the MPRE confident that I was going to do just as well.  However, the actual MPRE bore little semblance to anything I had been prepared for.  Bottom line: I'll be taking the MPRE again.  Thank you and goodbye Supreme Review, hello BarBri 
 Rob touches on so much with this CD.  My favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my opinion, the public missed out a great hit!  "Streetcorner Symphony" is about people coming together. It's what I call my happy song.  Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I can get it!  We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also called it a happy song!  I can't wait for his live albulm to come out! There are fast and slow songs on this CD and will be worth EVERY PENNY you spend to buy it! Incredible voice and songwritting 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Ok, first off, i'd like to say, i'm an intermediate c++ programmer, I dabbled for c++ for about a year, and have been seriouse about c++ for the last 6 months. I'm not saying that gives me the right to pass judgement on this book, but I do think it says that I know enough about coding to decide how I feel about the book, and if its right for me. . . Now thats out of the way, so lets move on to why the book isnt good for me.   First off, if you can, take a look at the code used in the examples of this book before you buy it. Why? Because thats the biggest reason i dont like it. The coding style this guy has is just terrible to me! Now that, without a doubt, is a matter of personal oppinion, the code is functional, it works, it compiles , i just dont prefer the style. Now, if you can, look at the code examples in Game Programming All In One 2nd Edition, you'll see cleaner, more easy to read code.   Second point, the code is slightly buggy. I know i said that it worked, and compiled. It does, it works fine, for buggy software. The style that this guy has, and the way he makes his programs makes for buggy, and hard to read programs. He doesent really break problems down like he says he's going to. In a well coded, clean game engine, you should be able to read through the code and say to yourself "hey, i know what this will do, i can see the output in my head"....     Third point, The teaching style of the author. The author is rather boring, and doesent have much of a humor, wich i believe can make things a little easyer to learn. A laugh here and there is good for you. Another problem i had with his teaching style is, theres no clarity in what your supposed to be doing as you read through his examples.  The way i went through this book was, i'd read, then type out the example, then read the explanation...  you'd think that would work yeah?   No, when i got to the end of the chapter, i realized that we were not working on just 1 src file, we were working on also a header file, there was no transition, so your kindof running blind....  unless you wanna copy/paste the code and use it as a buggy sortof crutch.  well, thats my basic rundown. if you want to start game programming, and are familiar with c++, i would definately not reccomend this book to my friends...  i'd reccomend Game Programming All In One 2nd Editio 
 What the ----.  "A tale of revenge"?  Why does everyone in their review say that?  B/c it's written on the box cover??  This is an interesting and compelling movie, but w/ a very odd, abrupt ending that leaves you hitting the "REWIND" button and saying, "what a minute, is it OVER??  Did I miss something??"  Afte watching this, I scoured the internet, Wikipeida, and Amazon...still no reviewer seems able to say what was meant by the ending of this film.  My takeaway on it -- she is going to hang, and die (go to heaven);  he is going to stay on Earth..but maybe when they meet again (heaven), they can get married.  ??  ????  How come no one else can come up w/ a definitive meaning to the end of this film?  Subtlety is great, but not if it's so damn ambiguous that NOBODY in the universe seems to be able to define or explain what this film was all about.  It was NOT about revenge.  Maybe it was about love and obsession and sadness and the silliness of despair.   Sorry, can't really recommend this one! 
 I read almost the entire book, only to find out that there wasn't an ending??  I couldn't wait to find out if Teresa was convicted, and what her sentence was, only to find out that the author ended the book before that could be determined.  Was the author so desperate for a pay out that she couldn't wait alittle longer to give her book the proper ending??  I am beyond disappointed.  Infact I am disgusted!!  
 I used to love Iris Johansen's books esp. her Eve Duncan books. The last few though have been terrible. On the Run was the final straw, she's lost me as a reader. I read about 100pgs and gave up. The plot was so dumb I can't believe she got someone to publish it. 
 This book is the biggest pile of excrement ever written. It is also full of cryptic run on sentences that waste paper and ink.  This book should not be allowed 
 As far as I know there is only one tempo and one type of dance sequence on this mat.  No matter how much we play around with the different buttons it does not do anything different.  This was a big request from my 6 year old daughter for Christmas and now she hardly plays with it.  It entertains our 15 month old twins more!  Resist any begging by your kids for this item and buy something else, a CD boombox maybe 
 I was quite excited to see this book & read the comments.  Princeton University Press doesn't publish much classics, and I had high hopes for this volume.  When it arrived, I was upset to learn that it was a Bollingen imprint -- Jungian propaganda, with a lot of imagination, outdated scholarship and contempt for scholarly values.  It really is despicable of Princeton to tarnish their reputation with their Bollingen imprint, and I feel like a sucker to have wasted my money on such a preposterously worthless book, and I wish that Amazon.com would put a warning label on the Bollingen imprints, so clearthinking people can be more careful when ordering.  (The problem is, of course, that few excellent books are mixed in with the nonsense, so one can't dismiss Bollingen books out of hand, but there is usually a 90% chance that they are garbage. 
 Captain Alatriste is the first in a series and, like a lot of series, you're really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with Captain Alatriste.  The problem is that there isn't enough of Captain Alatriste in Captain Alatriste.  It's told through his own Sancho Panza, Inigo, his steady sidekick, who has stories of his own to tell.  But those stories only distract from the main story, which is paper thin to begin with.  Throw in a lot of songs and poems and you've got a sleepy reader 
 The author puts forth a "New view' and changes his story characters so then I didn't get my wish of 'how I would have hoped Soalme's d. turned out. 
 We bought this on amazon about 5 months ago after a cheaper black & decker one had the heat element buckle after 6 months.  I thought if I upgraded a bit, I could get a bit more milege out of it- like maybe 2 years...but now with only 5 months of usage...suddenly no power.  Totally dead.  It is still under warranty so if the shipping costs to get it to a warranty center aren't too outrageous we'll try that route, other wise, looks like another waste of money.  I have to say that while it did work, we enjoyed it.  It was roomy enough to cook a few cookies or heat up leftovers as needed without heating up the whole big oven, and made great bacon in the warmer- a bonus we weren't expecting. update to this review: I sent in to warranty center and they replaced it with a new one.  It took a while and then they sent the wrong item (same name different product-honest mistake) but were very very nice when I called and sent the right one out right away- now just hoping this one lasts more than 5 months 
 A thoroughly self-indulgent narrator abandons her family on a whim and ventures out (on her husband's dime?) to "discover herself" and experience the kinds of things her priviledged, sheltered life never offered her. The novel is nicely crafted, but the character is shallow and cloying--sadly, I think we're supposed to support her. I kept hoping she'd return home to an empty house. 
 This book is not what I expected at all...  I its nothing of interest...  I think I have learned more about that in a wonderful spanish magazine "El Mueble" the thing is that I cant find it here in the States.. 
 steer clear.  This movie suffers from terminal SCS... Shaky Camera Syndrome, the latest thing nowadays to make a movie look cool.  Not only does that leave you disturbed physically, but it distracts you from what could be crucial elements of the story, such as Giovanni Ribisi's family history, which they also manage to screw up, leaving you really not caring if he wins or loses in the end.  Pile on top of that the awful acting and the extremely poor casting choices of Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel, and you have a waste of time.  As for Giovanni Ribisi, he's ok in this movie, but go buy/rent Heaven with him and Cate Blanchett 
 The absolute worst book eve 
 Of all the reasons to be interested in pi, surely curing your father's belly ache is the least inspired. This book is about politics not mathematics 
 This book is a farce.  It is filled with outdated and incomplete lists and very little content.  The SPARCE writing that is in the book seems to serve the purpose of taking space between the lists.  It doesn't provide any helpful information.  It is clear that the author doesn't know any more about starting a record company than the average Joe band member 
 When it works, this blender does a fine job, and looks great.  However, our first one quit turning the blades in less than a year. We sent it in, after MANY calls to customer service, and they kept the darned thing for 3 months before deciding to send us a replacement.  The replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke.  During that 2 years, we figured out that our extra set of blades didn't fit in bottom ring properly, and allowed fluid to pour through the motor.  Great.  I should have save up to buy a vitamix instead 
 this books chapter titles were random as hell and so was the book. its so weird.  there is no plot whatsoever. i hated it, don't buy it cuz it sucks major balls 
 I'm using this book for an undergraduate thermo class.  It is one of the worst textbooks I have used.  It may be large and comprehensive, but the organization is horrible.  The book is extremely unclear, and when you start to do the problems at the end of the chapter, you really see how little got through to you.  The problems are often vague and hard to understand, which adds to the problem.  You can read it over and over and still get neither the math of thermodynamics, nor the physics behind it 
 The title of this book is misleading. I expected to find a detailed analysis of Viking warfare, but found a rather unprofessional rant on Scandinavian culture in the Viking Era. It is easy to see how a perception of history can be slanted, based upon the bias of the author. This insight is useful, however, in the review of latter-day protagonist saga writers or antagonist monks. Little more can be learned from this text 
 I can't believe they would ruin perfectly good toilet paper on this. What's the world coming to 
 I tried to read this book after the death of my Dad due to a long battle with cancer.  This author can only "help" or more accurately share stories of how dysfunctional her relationship with her father was, and how promiscuous she was, what a bad friend she was to those around her, rather than actually tell you anything about what life is like after the death of a father that you had a healthy relationship with.  If you are normal and your father is normal, and you were friends with your father, this book is not for you.  If you need therapy and your Dad needs therapy, here is clearly the book for you.    This book is full of sweeping generalizations to validate the author's bad decisions in the relationships in her life.  It is not backed up with any research or facts of any kind.  She should have bought a journal and written about the bad relationship in private rather than publish it.  Please do not buy this book 
 I was very disapointed. The women can't sing. They sounded very cheesy and bland. Every now and then you night hear a sound that hits the spot, but most of the time tumbs down.. They got old real quick. I don't really think I will be listening to this album much at all. Don't waste your money. 
 I read all the review I could find on this product and most were bad.  A few recent ones were better.  The first problem I encountered was the power on button did not function correctly.  I had to press, press harder, shake the device, and finally turn it upside down while pressing to power it on.  I was never able to power it down with the on/off button.  The wireless AP worked fine but it would not function with an ethernet cable.  I thought it was me (though I've unboxed and setup 25+ wireless, wire only, routers, swithes, etc. without problems.  After several hours of trying different approaches I looked at documentation, knowledge base articles and found one that indicated if the device power light blinked continuously the device was defective.  That was the end of it and I returned it for credit.   I do not recommend this device to anyone.  T. Ragan - Cypress, T 
 Not to dissent, but this seems more one man's personal manifesto than a guide for making apps conform with existing Windows standards. Did Microsoft Press just farm this book out to some random writer? Not that he doesn't raise the occasional valid point, but if you're looking for Windows standards and practices, be it ui or infrastructure--or if you're looking for the results of solid research as opposed to assertions of opinion--look elsewhere 
 I loved the first book, liked the second, and wonder about this one. What happened to the story about Zaphod conspiring to become President of the Galaxy to steal the Heart of Gold and find the six people who rule the universe?!?   This book shares the same characters as the first two, but the plot comes out of nowhere. After I finished the book, I still don't completely understand what happened! 
 I only glanced through this book, yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied.  I can, however, write about one of the editors, Mike Shaw, who made no attempt whatsoever to 'find the evidence' when assessing us as parents.  He works as a Consultant Child Psychiatrist in London, England and seems to specialise in offering his services as an 'expert witness' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the Mental Health Act.   We had our children taken away on the grounds that they were "at risk of neglect". Mike Shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations. Yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched. Under cross examination, he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations.  Luckily for us, he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist.  I don't know about his co-editors, but if his work is anything to go by, the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced.  Here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court.  Judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously.  Evidence-gathering. "On 9.8.02, I interviewed Mr & Mrs Orman [2 hours] "On 21.8.02, I met the family at Trent Park where I spoke to Mrs Orman alone [40 mins], witnessed contact [1 hour] and spoke to the children without their parents [20 mins] [and] I interviewed the foster carer [2 hours].  Observations. "Mr & Mrs Orman were friendly and co-operative throughout.[...] Mr Orman showed insight [... but] wasn't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children. The couple were very robust in refuting the [welfare's] account, which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation.  "Contact took place in the park[...]The parents and children seemed happy to see each other; they chatted in animated style. [...] I wasn't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children's presence   "[Interviewing the children] The children seemed attentive [...] but answered "don't know", fell silent and looked at each other when I asked them questions [...] Erin related [a Simpsons episode where] Homer [...] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside. I found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about Mr Orman's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed. [Note. This is submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document!]  Conclusions & Recommendations "[...] I observed Mrs Orman as shy and anxious while Mr Orman was very pleasant but forceful. [...]  "Mr and Mrs Orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children. So it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact. [...] I think there is some insecurity in the children's attachment to their parents. [Note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park.]  "Were Mr Orman to be caring for the children on his own, I would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs. [...] Asked whether he had any regrets, Mr Orman didn't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care. [...] Erin [who was 8 at the time] needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper, and support and advise socially. I suspect Mr Orman would find this difficult.  "My concern about Mrs Orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness. [...] I wonder whether Mrs Orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging [sic] children.   "[...]The children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact I observed [sic] and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home.  "[...] returning home is likely to further retard the children's social and emotional development. [...]  "These children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse. [...] it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause. I also find very plausible Ms [Charlotte] Curran's suggestion (... [in] her [written] statement) that Mr Orman dominates his wife.  "The children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me, but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible. [..] I believe the children need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster carers. [...] contact should be gradually reduced."  Mike Shaw's answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities, but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6-hour investigation. Yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed, so that the children could lead a normal and happy life. He could not comment on government statistics that show that 70% of all children placed in long-term foster care end up as delinquents.  Our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt; and the case was eventually closed.  So much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions 
 I ordered a case for my Kodak DX6490 digital camera from ANTONLINE thru AMAZON but received a case that is inches too small for my camera.  If the numbers referenced above show in the review, you can see that my model of camera does not appear.  In spite of this ANTOLINE has refused to issue an RMA for its return and replacement with the correct case and has stated they will refuse it if I return without their RMA. They tell me it cannot be sold as new since it was opened.  The only packaging was a brown padded envelope.  Is there another way of seeing inside the envelope without opening it? I guess I could go to the airport and put it through the screener.  There is a little tag on the case that reads DX6490 but it obviously is not since the size is incorrect in height, depth and width and my number does not appear on their invoice. When I checked Kodak online, the dimensions for my camera case were larger in all three dimensions.  Amazon is attempting to resolve the matter but as yet have no feed back from them either. At this point I would never patronize ANTOLINE again 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Material like this is why the Church soars toward  head knowledge and is vacant in the Love of Christ 
 This kit is just junk. The "deluxe blower brush" is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a "tweezers" that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The "lintless cleaning cloth" is an about 3" x 5" piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges 
 If you are a creative type that prefers abstract thinking and colorful visualizations, then this book is for you.  For the rest of us, I found little use for it.  In fact, I found it annoying with dogs and cats becoming part of the energy grid and talking animals demanding new parts for the author's systems.  Frankly, if my pets started talking to me, I'd be concerned.  I had to read other books first, before I could even begin to understand what the author was talking about.  Not a good book for linear thinkers 
 This is undoubtedly the most boring wrestling book that I have ever read. 99% of the time the author is giving derogatory statements about everything that the WWE stands for. I found the book so boring that after I had read 2/3 of it I put it aside, however, I do plan to later finish the boo 
 This author has so much talent and paints the most exquisite pictures with words but the plot of this book was so fragmented, disorganized and unfocused that it distracted from his lovely writing style. I wasn't sure if the book was about Jack the Ripper, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, A Christmas Carol, losing a child, hauntings, possession, redemption or all of the above because it kept going off in different directions.  The relationships between the characters were confusing and the characters were never very well developed.  Worst of all, it just fell off at the end with no resolution.  Sometimes this works but it didn't work with this book.  Very disappointing 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 This book, like many such collections (especially those that bring together papers from a conference), is tremendously uneven in quality.  There are a few good essays here--and they are by persons who have written illuminating and substantial pieces in the past.  And then there are a lot of weak essays here--pieces which do not get de Beauvoir right or which attempt without success to advance certain themes that are supposed present in her work.  The volume's introduction is especially flawed in this respect--as a piece of intellectual history or contextualization it is not bad (though not original either), but as a piece of philosophy it is . . . well, not philosophical.  Volumes by Arp, Berghoffen, and Bauer measure up very well to this collection 
 Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found "Truth" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible. Give this one a pass 
 I started reading the book as a part of my personal development with the company that I work for. The book is founded in behaviorism, and does not stray from the concepts associated with this worldview. My issue with it is that I believe that people are more than a reaction to the things that happen to us. We have unique personalities, and they consist of more than the conditioning that they are subjected to. This psychology takes away the idea of free-will and choice, and eliminates personal responsibility. When it comes to managing people, I believe that these are important elements to tap into. This behaviorist approach to management may look good on the surface, and make logical sense, but is flawed by its nature, and cannot have any long lasting impact 
 Our culture is killing the planet. Car culture is incredibly destructive of the natural world.  Cars, for example, are the main cause of death for the gravely endangered Florida panther. And Knutson makes jokes about cars killing wild animals. Only a culture that has absolutely no respect for the natural world could produce someone who would think roadkill is funny, and would write a book about it. Knutson had a wonderful opportunity to meaningfully explore the horrifying effects of car culture, and chose instead to write this disturbing and disgusting book 
 I'm not a fan of memoirs, but I thought to give this one a shot. Boy, was that a mistake. As most memoirs I have read, this is way too self-indulgent and self-pitying to my liking. It claims to be honest, but I highly doubt it is. The writing is bad. Some characters and events are mentioned for seemingly no reason. It appears Ms. Zailckas confused writing a memoir with writing a diary 
 I agree with everything Anne M. Koch had to say about this book in her earlier review of it, and I'd apply it to Dodman's other books, too. I add these thoughts as well:  Once you've read two of Dodman's cases, you know the formula: "This was the presenting case--this is what I pessimistically taught the owners to do with their pet--and THIS is the drug I prescribed!" His books are stultifying once you've learned the key behavioral factors he identifies (which are useful in and of themselves).  Does Dodman care at all about these animals, beyond their usefulness as subjects for his drug experimentation and potential appearance in the next repetitive volume he grinds out? His persona is reptilian and ambitious once you get past the stilted expressions of his caring about the creatures he so readily medicates out of their gourds.   Even more bothersome to me is his failure to draw any ethical line when it comes to dogs suffering radical predation/aggression. Were Dodman a bit less thrilled with his own pharmaceutical heroics, he might realize there's a time to say, "Either find another home for this dog or put him down, or I can't be responsible if he devours your baby or maims your friends." No, Dr. Dodman: when such a dog is 90% better on drugs, I'm not risking that 10% around my loved ones, thank you!  I think that his volumes might have a limited usefulness to practicing veterinarians, if they can get past their author's false-ringing tone, and if you know little to nothing about dogs and cats, you'll pick up a few key bits of information--over and over again.  I'm in search of better authors on the subject, and I plan to read the books recommended by Koch in her review-she seems more knowledgable and human than the author at point here is 
 I just dont hear it guys, volume swells, lots of minor 9ths and sus chords. There is not alot going on here harmonicaly. I will listen some more but this is pretty wonder bread to me...... 
 The author does a good job of disguising recycled safety information under an intriguing title. The book touches on different safety topics but the author lacks a 'street' mind.   I guest when you think of it all books have something good but this one has allot of words saying nothing to try and get the reader to believe they are learning something.  This subject has many books written from proven professionals that were SEALS, Cops or Elite Bodyguards. In my law enforcement opinion I would do some more research before I committed to a book like this.  Very disappointed to say the least! 
 I purchased this film to show my high school students who just finished reading the novel.  Since they really got into the novel and its overall significance for their own lives, I thought showing the related film would be a good idea.  However, I was so very disappointed in this film and its negligent portrayal of the journey of Siddhartha.  I'm not even sure I want to show it to them now!  The film does very little to capture the symbolism and depth of character found in the novel.  The acting, dialogue, and events seem as dry as a story-board with no color.  Many of the most profound moments in the novel are omitted, while other moments are altered to make them almost laughable.  A film that captures the beauty and true nature of the novel is long overdue.  This film appears dated (and I don't mean Gautama Buddha dated) and the acting and character portrayals are VERY 1972.  Don't get me wrong, the film may have been "remarkable" for its time, but it would be nice to see a film-maker attempt to capture the true essence of Siddhartha and his life-journey.  Besides, a few special effects when Govinda sees the faces of all living things in the image of Siddhartha would be pretty cool!  
 The earrings looked so pretty in the picture.  In real life, they look cheap.  They look like plastic, not like crystal.  Very disappointed.  
 I was thrilled by the first season's creative and compelling representation of characters.  The opening titles, music, dramatizations, editing, as well as, subtle humor of the first season, was an artful and poignant display of life to which many people, regardless of sexual orientation, could relate.  I was immediately disappointed by the second season, however, as it quickly dissolved a great work of art and turned it into cheap pulp.   I hope that the third and fourth season doesn't make the same mistake.  
 Have you seen the smarmy come-ons for shonky products? Sometimes advertised on TV or radio. With a free 800 phone number you can call, for free material. Sounds promising, you think. But then when the literature arrives, it's little more than a push to buy the "premium" stuff. That is what Horner's book feels like. She waffles all over the place, with interminable babble about the greatness of her method. Yet a careful parsing of the book shows little substance. All the while "subtly" mentioning her website with the hot stuff. Bait and switch.  Well, you could save some money and avoid this book. But unlike some others who suggested you visit her website and drop $400, I would recommend also avoiding it. Given the vapidness of the book, it is not a good precursor 
 Meredith Ann Pierce is hands down my favorite author of all time, but I really didn't see the point to this book.  The stories were often scattered and irratic, lacking clear plot, character development and resolution.  Some stories would have made better whole novels, and others, I am sorry to say, should have been left out of print.  Still, I enjoy her writing style and the presentation of worlds in many ways similar to our own but with added elements of magic and fantasy.  I hope Ms. Pierce's next endeavor is more along the lines of the Firebringer or Darkangel trilogies.  Those were truly great works of literature 
 Ms Gunst is not bad as a storyteller and this book might have made a good novel. But after talking to some people she 'interviewed' and hearing how she twisted their words, I don't think it is worth very much as a work of history 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 Claiming to be a book which bridges the divide between the worlds of academia and populism, Japan Pop! gets off to a poor start with an absurdly high cover price likely to put it out of reach of the casual J-Pop Culture fan. The price might have been justified had this been a glossy, photo-packed book, but seems ludicrous given that it is merely a collection of 17 essays. The essays dwell on four major areas of contemporary J-Pop Culture: music, manga and animation, TV & film and the popularity of J-Pop Culture outside of the country. It comes as little surprise that Mark Schilling's contribution, about the Tora-san character in the Otoko wa Tsurai yo (It's Tough Being a Man) film series, is the most interesting - not necessarily because of the topic, but because Schilling is the only contributor who is a writer of any repute. The majority of these essays are written by academics and it shows: footnotes abound, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers get analysed to the nth degree and claims are made that "Sailor Moon's rearrangement of the traditional superhero myth bears hints of not only a new social order, but also the kind of moral struggles, alliances, and identities that may create and accompany it." The book also contains a number of confidence-sapping factual errors (example: Osaka band Shonen Knife "started playing in the mid-1980s" which is not true, they started playing in December 1981). Schilling's Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture (Weatherhill) remains the definitive starting point for those seeking a good, accessible introduction to the subject; Japan Pop! is only for the otaku completist, and a wealthy one at that 
 Despite the hyperbolic praise on the back cover--best war novel of the twentieth century!!!--I found this Ballard offering so tedious and unpleasant that I gave up on it just thirty or so pages before the end. My main problem was with Jim; he's basically the only character and he's so unlikable that after a while you just don't feel like spending any more time with him. In Jim you also see the germ of the fascist leanings so evident in the main characters of the truly execrable--but at least readable--Ballard novels __Cocaine Nights__ and __Super-Cannes__.  In my opinion, if you want to read the semi-autobiographical adventures of a boy in an occupied country, you're better off with __The Painted Bird__. If you prefer books about life in prison camps, try __If This Is a Man__ or __The Truce__ by Primo Levi. You'll find in his books the humanity so glaringly absent in Ballard's 
 I hate to be negative about a book from the German prespective, as they are rare, but I feel I must for others not to waste their money. The book is a general and basic operational overview of the end stages of combat in the Silesia area. If you are only looking for dates, places, and names of units involved this book is for you but, if you are like me, there are ZERO personal accounts included, which are needed to "flesh" out a book like this, to give you a better understanding of the various battles described. 
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 Directors, actors, and all others associated with the film industry make a real effort to be cerebral.  It's understandable, as it's a worthy goal.  99.5% of them fail - perhaps it's a lack of education, maybe it's poor upbringing that has reinforced self-absorption, and it could be that the superficiality which makes them such a good fit in Hollywood directly leads to this end.  The only redeeming quality of the film is that it exposes human foibles (and this is not a new concept - it's typically an element of every movie).  It seems that movies these days fall on either end of two extremes: telling stories of people who unrealistically do the right thing, or blathering of shallow morons who are poor subjects of empathy.  This falls into the latter category.  I want that hour and a half of my life back for a more worthy endeavor such as playing target practice into a trash can with a staple gun. 
 Maybe my expectations were too high; The Killing Floor did win the Edgar for best first novel, but I guess it must have been a weak year. Lee Child's first offering is typical of a first book, and that's the problem the story is typical. Nothing surprising or new here. It is both predictable and implausible. The book's hero, Jack Reacher, is boring. I think he is supposed to be mysterious and troubled, but I found him grating and arrogant. The book reads like a B action movie. The whole plot not only stretches the imagination, but also one's grasp of reality. It seems that Child has never left New York City and understands neither the American justice system nor small town life. Maybe I missed something, but I found The Killing Floor to be a sub-par thriller with flat characters and rather large plot holes 
 Backhouse tries to give a brief, accessible summary of the history of economics, but the book is so dry that it is almost unreadable.  Although Backhouse brings in some social and political background, for the most part he's just listing people and theories.  His explanations, designed for non-technical readers, are not mathematically complex, and do avoid unneccesary terminology.  But they're written in a choppy, condensed style, without illumination from real-world examples.  The result is just not compelling reading.  And his decision to take his history back to Greek times doesn't really work: the pre-modern thinkers omitted from most standard histories aren't consciously writing about economics.  Rather, Backhouse is inferring economic assumptions from literary or ethical discussions.  This discussion is potentially interesting (although it suffers from the same flaws as the rest of the book), but not really the same subject-matter as the conventional history of economics 
 Like so many of you, I love Stephen King. I really do. He has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker. But hey, we already had to read Gerald's Game! At least Gerald's story wasn't very long. However, Wolves of the Calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring. Also like so many of you, I do in fact plan to read all of King's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons. But, knowing this, knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell King puts on the menu--shouldn't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence? If you cut all of the fat from Wolves you'd be left with one tasty little steak, perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine. Instead we have a book that simply doesn't do anything. You know from the get-go what's going to happen in the end and in King's own words (out of Roland's mouth)--that's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes--after a several hour investment--simply do not pay off. I was bored out of my f---ing mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and I didn't even have Frank Muller as the reader to help me get through the journey. On that note, I truly hope Mr. Muller is on the mend. King ... well ... he's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it. But if Cell, a very mediocre book, is the indication of where King's going--is the best of him behind us now 
 If you want to watch a bunch of the Undertakers best matches then this is a good DVD.  If you want to learn anything of the history of the Undertaker, either the man or the character you won't get any of that here.  This is bascially a bunch of matches with a little voice over in between, similar to the Ric Flair DVD (but without the great promos as Taker isn't exactly one of wrestlings great speakers, nor is Paul Bearer for that mater lol).  This DVD has no vignette with interviews with the wrestler or history of the character from McMahon and company whatsover (unlike the Bret Hart, Hogan and Warrior DVD's).  Furthermore the cover art is horrible and all of the discs are all stuffed into one side of the box (as opposed to it opening up to several DVD flaps with picture art (e.g. Flair and Hart DVD's).  If you are a wrestling purist then it is okay, else wait for the inevitable second 5 or 6 disc DVD WWE will release when he retires in a year or two.  
 Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
 Package missing.  It's never be received.  So I cannot rate it 
 I wish I could return it but I broke the warranty by using the hack described elsewhere.   I imagined listening to my computer on a dedicated FM station throughout the house.  The best I ever got was terrible reception in the kitchen.  It may work in other parts of the country or other parts of the world, but it did not work for me in West Palm Beach 
 How can a group fall as far as they did?  "Who Can You Trust" and "Big Calm" were both classics (dispite the fact that they sounded totally different from one another).  Now with "FoF" it just went down hill...and never came back 
 The writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense.  I thought something might change, that it might become an interesting ghost story, or there might be moral issues, or maybe even a character would grow or change.  The heavy-handed ending is, perhaps, intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in Amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones...but that's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness.  Are we supposed to take everything that Ellie says about the Amish in court (peaceful, gentle, incapable of murder, loving, child-centric, willing to accept an out-of-wedlock child into the community) as lies?  The ending belongs to a much darker book.  My biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing, I kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story.  
 I have to say that with the exception of the cupid story the over-all affect of this book brought me down.  Granted it wasn't the 100% sex writing that she's turned into, however it was possibly the exact flip side. All the stories together resulted in a sad book.  
 Adams covers the same info that Conrad and Baker discuss but with a tone of condescension and puritanism that blankets the text like a fine scum of oil over water. Halfway though the book I wanted to curse him; after listening to his boorish and uninspired NPR interview I wanted to punch his lights out. If you like feeling superior, this book is for you. Otherwise stick with Conrad 
 ...because that's how he makes his money and fame. Without it, he'd be known for what he ultimately is: a poor charlatan posing as a "scholar. 
 I liked this book very much when I started reading it.  The authors' characterizations of sailing were right on the money.  The characters and plot start out interesting but it seems the book was rushed to a sloppy and confusing ending that left me dissatisfied and wanting more.  I kept waiting for somthing to tie things together, but it never happened 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 This book isn't really about arms and armor-- it's about weapons. If you are looking for a book that is compleatley about arms and armor, then find another book, but if you want a book that is about the history of weapons, then this is the book for you. I was looking for arms and armor, and this book didn't really have that much information on it 
 I bought this book hopeing to get into shape for my wedding, I find it dificult to follow. Yes she does map out a plan but you have to filp back and forth and practilly memorize the book before you go to the gym to get the moves down! 
 I liked this author's previous book "A Woman of Substance," so I ploughed my way through the rest of the series. The quality of her writing and characterization has steadily deteriorated with each successive book. I actually find myself sympathizing more with the "villains" than the supposed heroines of the piece. Every time heroines Linnet or Evan refer to Evan's "adopted" sister, the supposed "bad seed" Angharad or old Edwina thinks that "genetics is everything," I feel like slapping someone. Maybe Angharad is jealous and envious because her family was so obviously biased to the supposedly perfect Evan! I feel the same way about Linnet's sister Tessa, who rapidly became my favorite character in this series, such as it was. Tessa's jealous because everyone DID favor her little sister Linnet, who reminds everyone of Emma Harte. The whole family's devotion to the great-grandma who died more than 30 years ago is unnatural. And, sadly, Bradford's dialogue stinks as much as her characterizations. I don't know if even a soap opera would take her on as a writer. 
 Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See "The Sacketts', "Conagher", "The Shadow Riders", or "The Quick and the Dead". This is far less a believable Western. Few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern, not authentic. Sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie. Not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters I would want to see developed 
 its a throw. like a blanket. i would have been better off with a pretty cutain to think of it. it would be better than what i wasted my money on.  also dont wash this with anything else. the die leaks 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 I purchased both this book and John Kremer's 1001 Ways to Market Your Book.  Kremer's book is far superior, far more thorough, and far more practical for self-publish authors.  Buy Kremer's book and save your time and money.  I don't recommend Guerrilla Marketing for Writers 
 Great pictures, but did Donald Trump write the story line?  The books ends with a smug Thomas exclaiming "I am first and you are last!"  
 The self-righteousness of this book is annoying ("Using chemical cleansers in my home is not an option"), the new-age tone is cloying ("When I saw my midwife's face light up with joy and wonderment everytime she touched my womb... I knew she was living her soul's task"), and the sincere self-congratulation on her own wonderful, wholesome, healthful, spiritual lifestyle is irritating. But so what, I just wanted the recipes. So I skipped the seventy page long section on "the denatured foods of commerce" and tried some. I am already a vegetarian and I was looking for some good food without milk or eggs. But I was disappointed. My biggest problem was the ingredients. One example: every other recipe calls for "Vogue Vege Base" - I had never heard of it. I went to a couple of big natural food stores, and nobody in either of these had heard of it -and I live in CAMBRIDGE, MA, WHERE EVEN THE CONVENIENCE STORES HAVE NATURAL, ORGANIC FOODS!!! Another favourite ingredient is Bragg Liquid Aminos. Hijiki, sprouted wheat, brown rice syrup, agar powder, slippery elm powder, flax seeds... the list of things I don't have in my kitchen is SO long that it's overwhelming. It's not just ingredients - equipment is also a stumbing block. (Do you have a Vita-Mix Total Nutrition Center?) I did try a few things, they were only ok. Instead of this book, I recommend '150 Vegan Favorites', by Jay Solomon -easy recipes with straighforward ingredients that always turn out well 
 I just ran across this book today at the local bookstore and thought I'd take a look. The writer I might best compare Kimball to is P.J. O'Rourke who can certainly be very funny but his humor is ultimately derived by refusing to look at the larger picture. Kimball manages to find some of the least accessible texts in art criticism -- ones that do perhaps provide extreme readings of the given paintings, and then engages in homey-gee-golly 'sometimes a cigar is just a cigar' readings of the texts. What he doesn't provide is an alternative reading -- what does HE think the painting is about? But the big problem with his criticism is that he isolates one example of an extreme reading (by, say, Michael Fried) and convinces the reader that this one reading stands in a synecdochical relationship to the whole of the critic's work. It is from this position that Kimball launches his straw-man attack. The truth is that art really is a product, trace and sign of racial, classed and gendered power most of the time. I'm sure many people wish that art could just be "beautiful" and taken at face-value (and that evolution was not a fact!) but the world is just not that way. Art is complicated and we owe much to critics who, by reconstructing the historical contexts for making and looking, production and reception, etc. reveal things in pictures that might have been transparent even to the artist him- or herself. Especially telling is an epilogue wherein Kimball says that he could have done a similar reading of something like T.J. Clark's work. I would have enjoyed seeing that attempt given Clark's careful historical documentation --- The fact that Clark etc. are not included further proves the straw-man nature of Kimball's criticism.  I have no doubt that Kimball is an intelligent, educated critic in his own right which is why it is so disappointing to see him resort to this kind of writing 
 Growing up as a "boomer" in the 50's and 60's as I did was as transforming an event as the transition from the 20's to the 30's for many, and Kerouac was one of those whose writings captured that transformation for me and millions of others with his "On the Road" best seller in 1957. He had his detractors like Capote who sniffed at him as just being "a typist" but millions loved his break from the suburban swamps and into the "beat" generation which he had named, doing drugs, experimenting with all kinds of sex, and just adding to the general adolescent rebellion that took form in the 60's in many ways. This book, in Kerouac's letters and other writings from his other friends, shows him to be a much different kind of person. A serious student of other writers in serious times, he was much more complex than "sex, drugs, and rock and roll". He was almost completely paralyzed by self-doubt for most of his life, and his alcoholism obviously took a toll on his brain before it killed him at 47. This book in the form of Kerouac's writings is most revealing. The problem with this book is its author/editor, Brinkley. Brinkley leaves out any mention of the journal Kerouac completed which is at the U of Texas in Austin, or his tangle with the law with Ginsberg, and many other misquotes and factual errors. But what this book reveals most about Brinkley is that he is really not the historian he holds himself out to be; he is just another hired gun, willing to write incomplete and misleading hagiographies for the right price, as he did for John Kerry or Jimmy Carter, among others.  Hopefully someday the Kerouac estate will allow a real historian access to the material they have and not leave it to someone who is willing to shave the facts here and there to make a work of fiction instead of a real story about a real man.  
 After reading all the other rave reviews, I thought I had found the dream machine!...but...alas my old Krups, though slightly on the down side of it's brewing and steaming life, does a much...I mean, MUCH better job of giving me a strong tasty latte every morning.  I may just order another Krups at a seventh of this price, and be glad I had it to return to.  Soooo, my recommendation is to not buy this machine if you like a really rich espresso, and a really foamy, hot latte.  
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 The book is easy to follow and is interesting, but it's not entirely about Dan Osman, around half of it is just autobiography of the writer itself. At the begging it makes sense for the author to write about his experience, but after a while it just gets too much! It wasn't exactly what I was expecting.   
 Read: "The Austrian-Jewish Mind". 95% of the men reviewed in this volume were Jews. Austria in the early 20th boils down to three strands of history: the fall of the Dual Monarchy, the Jews of Vienna -- and Austrians. You will not find anything about real Austrians in this book. 
 To summarize, IT'S CALLED SUPPLY AND DEMAND!  I agree with Anya, in that most kids don't get a good financial education from their parents, and that the loose consumer debt laws border on usury.  However, nobody is making kids rack up this credit card debt!  The point on college is true too.  I cringe when I hear someone is majoring in communication at a $30k a year private third-tier college.  What do they think they're going to do?  It's called supply and demand!!!  If Anya had her way, everyone would be a fashionista, journalist, or work in TV or film.  What these kids don't understand is that a small, small, small percentage of the population can do those things.  It's like in Office Space, when they put down the "do and major in what interests you" myth.  Peter points out, "if everyone listened to that, there would be no janitors, because nobody would want to clean up sh*t for a living!"  That's what these interviewees completely miss.    A very telling statement is on page 6, when Anya points out, "Only 24.4 percent of the adult population has a B.A., according to the 2000 census..."  What the hell?  Who cares about a BA?  Does she actually mean a bachelors degree?  I would suggest that only about 5% of the population needs a B.A., but more like 50% needs a B.S.  As Anya herself has found out, unless you're among the idle rich or an extremely talented writer, a B.A. isn't going to get you anywhere.  A traditional "liberal education," where you sit around and think about stuff and write papers and get your degree should be for only a small part of the population.  In super future utopia world, sure, everyone could get a traditional liberal education, but we're hundreds of years from that point.  We have to solve world poverty, war, and hunger first.  Anya decries the lack of vocational education throughout the book, but there's a huge "vocational" collegiate job training program out there, and it's called "a technical degree from a reputable institution."  Ipods don't spontaneously generate from the earth- they, like every other convenience of your life, were made by hard working, technically oriented people.  And there's no such thing as a person fundamentally not good at math or science.  It's like exercise.  Studying math or engineering, like working out, isn't easy or fun, but accomplishing something.   Also, not everyone can live in NYC or SF.  If you're living somewhere, and you're wondering why you can't pay your rent with three roommates, perhaps you should think about moving somewhere else.  It's called SUPPLY AND DEMAND.  You can buy a nice, two bedroom house in West Virginia for $30,000, today.  Think about that.  Also telling is the attitude of the interviewees.  Angus, who drifted around "[...] jobs" for 10 years, is quoted as such: "'I've had difficulty focusing,' Angus admits with a sheepish smile.'"  Let me tell you, sheepish guys with no agenda are lucky to have credit card debt and [...] jobs.  A hundred years ago, they would have just starved to death, or gone to debtors prison.  That's really the lesson from this book-  society has become so socially permissive that those who would have been bums a few years ago now can be disaffected, disenfranchised youth.  I don't want people to starve to death, but I don't want people to be bums, either.  Anya seems pretty down on the military, but joining the military would have solved any of these kids problems.  I think I'm a good example-- I went to Annapolis, majored in Electrical Engineering, and still today am in the Navy.  Is it the greatest thing ever?  No!  In fact, some days I'm downright unhappy about it.  I don't consider myself an engineer, nor do I really want to work in that field.  My family is secure, though, and my prospects are pretty good for a job someday soon-- moreso than if I had majored in sociology at UAB, for sure.  If you want to see what pain and suffering is about, read "The End of Poverty."  At least look at the first picture in the photo section, where there's a grandmother that must feed her fifteen grandchildren on half a hectare of rotted grain because all her children have died of AIDS.  Activism to fix that situation is something I can get excited about.  The plight of the young and fabulous is not something I can get excited about.  I would recommend you read this book, although I warn you, it's like a bad horror movie.  You can see the characters fates before they even finish their stories.  All of them, unless they change their attitude, will be in the exact same place 5, 10, or 30 years from now.  Anya has tried to demonstrate the injustice of our society, but she inadvertently has only elucidated the real cause 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book, with it's constant reviewing of past events just made me more sad than inspired to create art.   I am a painter, not a writer...so forcing myself to write all of the time just wasted valuable practice time. ( I also work full time and have a busy spouse that I like to spend time with) so every precious second that i can spend on my art I grab up.   I guess, for pepole who are in emotional distress, this book can teach you how to use art as a thereputic tool for recovery and self esteem. That is fine. For busy, self motivated artists who already enjoy making art...this book isn't going to deliver those fun moments of "get-up-off-your-behind" inspiration. For an energetic, get moving to make art book, read Danny Gregory's "the creative licence" instead.   In conclusion, this book has a lot to offer pepole who have had a troubled past and are working through a lot of anger and sadness, but that wasn't me. I just wanted to make art 
 I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, "The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events.  I suggest that readers of "Ahab's Wife" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read.  Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex  is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves.  I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts.  In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish 
 I was really looking forward to recieving these "MEMORY FOAM" slippers. When they arrived I was EXTREMELY disappointed to discover that they only had a "RUBBER" sole with terry cloth. (The terry cloth and color were beautiful and the size 11 narrow was great on the fit.)  I hope the factory just forgot to put the memory foam in this particular pair of slippers because if that is not the case then this company is guilty of false and misleading claims in their online product discription, as well as, the discription on the attached tag.  I returned these slippers the day after they arrived and am still in search of a pair of slippers WITH real memory foam that the wearer can actually feel 
 Oh boy...It really pains me to write this review and say the things that I'm about to say, but...I have no choice! This, as far as I'm concerned, is without a doubt the weakest AC/DC record ever. I know a lot of diehards are going to want to hang me for being such a heretic, but...I'm sorry, I grew up listening to "Back in Black", "For Those about to rock", "Highway to Hell" and "The Razor's Edge", so you can imagine how dissapointed I feel when I listen to slow songs like "Can't Stop RN'R", "Come and get it" "Damned"...AND THE DARN RECORD IS CHOCK FULL OF SONGS LIKE THAT!!! God, have mercy...whenever I have problems to sleep, I put this pill on...I can't listen to it, and I'm not joking!!! There are, of course, some great songs: the title track, "Safe in NY City", "Satellite Blues", and "Give it up" are stellar, some of the best songs the band has ever written. Sure, the songwriting is WAY more focused than say..."Fly on the Wall", but the songs are, for the most part, painfully slow and long, and they lack punch (except for those tracks that I mentioned earlier...)What the record gains in songwriting focus it loses in heavyness, and I think it's a bad tradeoff. So, 4 great, fast, rocking songs out of 12...How bad is that? Well, I'll let you decide, but I know that, at least for me, this record is truly stiff beyond recovery...      
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 Children of all ages who love yarns about the French Foreign Legion ought to try the granddaddy of all such books, UNDER TWO FLAGS, a classic 1867 adventure novel by "Ouida", pseudonym of the English novelist Marie-Louise de la Rame, 1839-1908.  ISBN: 0192823280 
 I'd like to start by saying how amazing New American Gospel is.  Then by saying what a solid follow-up As The Palaces Burn is.  Lamb of God is truly one of the best American thrash/metalcore acts.  However, If you enjoy either of their first releases, I would recommend skipping this one.  It's disappointing and generic.  If you're considering buying this and don't own the previous albums, buy them first.  Lamb of God is an aggressive, technically skilled band, and I really expect their next release to be a comeback after this one 
 Thomas Dilorenzo shines at misinformation in his new book.  Among the lies he states is that it is not widely taught that the Civil War was not just about slavery but also for economic reasons.  This is interesting to me as a history teacher, since any modern text, college, high school or grade school would have this information.   	In his new book Dilorenzo uses all the typical techniques, doublespeak, straw man attacks, and even goes as far to come with a "Lincoln cult" which is dubious at best. There is, simply put, no such thing.  Dilorenzo however thinks, there is one and denounces his enemies in the introduction (which if you do a little looking are actually just are his competitors in the Lincoln book market). 	Add to the fact that Mr. Dilorenzo uses web sites as his references instead of scholarly work (though he sometimes uses real books) and goes on and on about how Lincoln was not a Christian which is a completely irrelevant piece of information which is probably not true. Bottom line do not read this book, it is Libertarian slander or the lowest kind.   	However, if you want a book that is chock full of lies and first grade level verbal fallacy, by all means read this book 
 If you own a disc or two of this type of music, you already own this one.  Nothing different. You've already heard it.  Skip this one and check out Merry Mixmas-Christmas Classics Remixed or Reindeer Room Vol.1 instead 
 In the early going, I thought the choice was between four and five stars.  As the movie progressed, my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four, so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second.  The ending was so disappointing that I had to drop my rating to two stars.  It is about a Polish man in France who marries a French girl but is divorced by her because he is unable to make love to her.  He returns to Poland without her, manages to get rich, and comes up with a plot to get revenge on his beloved Dominique.  The problem with this writing is that he loves her, so why is he plotting revenge against her?  It is senseless.  The ending is utterly surreal.  She should hate him for what he has done to her, but she is smiling to him.  He is looking at her and crying.  He has betrayed her in a cruel way.  He doesn't have the right to be crying for her.  That is like Hitler crying for the Jews.  He is still in a position to help her out, but he won't.  It's really pretty sickening.  The story becomes unclear enough as it is, without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss.  It left me angrily saying "What the hell is going on?"  I really hate it when a director becomes unclear and plays with the audience.  I don't find that cute at all.  Tell the damn story and tell it clearly.  Besides, the ending sucks 
 I hate writing reviews. I also hate the consumer as much as the producers of goods for the most part but right now I'm feeling sprendthrift towards humanity due to all the Yuletide cheer. This book is rubbish. Nearly all of the posthumous books released by Black Sparrow/Ecco of Buk's work are fifth-rate, fragments of his glory days of skid-row bum-dom. It's as if they scraped his cancerous boils and produced enough DNA to put his soul back to life in a maggot's body with a Frankenstein's aptitude for producing works of art. The result is echoes of echoes of a former greatness. The rawness of the famed writer is lost in complete drunkenness and scraps of poems that were never published in books because they were leftover material. Maybe that's why John Martin sold off the rights because he couldn't continue to publish a dead man's best of works for obscene sums of money. If they retitled it WORST OF THE WORST: AFTERMATHS OF GLORY Vol. 5 I might feel better about the whole thing. But as is this is vainglorious puke. 
 This is my opinion only. This diet is just to far out there.  For example it wants you to eat Free range eggs but not really Chicken eggs?  Come on.  The average person doesn't have access to eggs that are not from a chicken.   The General idea of the diet is a good one they just go overboard.  Basically it is a low carb diet made more difficult.  You would almost have to be a fanatic to have any luck with this diet.    
 Playing Icewind Dale II reminds me of all of those novels written by American authors in the late 19th century. Though many of the novels were very well written, they never seemed to suck me in and continue reading the book. Icewind Dale II is like that. It looks nice, it supposedly improves gameplay, and it gives the player more character creation options, but I just don't really want to play it. Why? Well, at the end of the day, it seems as if Icewind Dale II is hurt by a extremely corny story; it is bogged down in numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly; it is just not as fun as its predescessor.   I bought this game for one reason and that reason was that I was addicted to Baldur's Gate II and needed to expand my party based rpg addiction to another realm. Icewind Dale II seemed to be the logical option. I was wrong. I was immediately confronted with a story so corny that it is almost embarassing to take part in. I was confronted with gameplay that caused me to run back and forth from one place to another constantly. I was confronted with battles so easy that I was soon bored.   I tried to play it again, but again I was plagued with the same problems. I installed a bunch of unofficial patches, but those did not solve the problems with the terrible puzzles and whatever else.   The overload of puzzles and corniness would be ok if you could diverge from the one path as you could in Baldur's Gate II, where you could accomplish quests at the order that you wanted to. Here you had to accomplish everything in a linear order and could never diverge from the path. Furthermore, the story seemed to be a retread of the story from the original Icewind Dale. In fact, the design of the game seemed to paralell it completely.   The final problem with this game concerns the fact that it is difficult to play if you have no knowledge of dungeons and dragons rules. If you do not know how to use rogues or are unfamiliar with feats and the like, this game will pose a very high learning curve that you may not want to climb. I was mostly familiar with the rules, but it was easy to see that someone who did not know them as well could easily make mistakes or be unfamiliar with the use of certain classes (even though the rule book was pretty exhaustive).   All in all, I do not think that this is a good game. I would just go with Baldur's Gate II or Icewind Dale I instead of this game. 
 The other bad reviews about this toaster are all true, it really is just a gimmick. Buy this toaster for looks if you'd like to have it in your kitchen, but also buy another cheap ten dollar toastermaster toaster from kmart or walmart and use that to make your actual toast behind the scenes--believe me, the toast will come out a lot better and I bet the ten dollar toaster will even last longer 
 This book take a long time to arrive at any substance on Schemas and is only good for total novices to world of XML Schemas. In-fact the real schema is seen only half way through the book. It definitely is a boring read 
 This book is not a good introductory to process control. Avoid this book at all cost  
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 Oh, dear. Le Carre is, or was earlier in his career, a brilliant writer.   I have read and reread a number of Le Carre books lately and what is clear to me is that the quality of his novels has deteriorated over the years, as one might expect, I suppose. Single and Single reads like something written to fill out a publishing contract for a certain number of books.  The plots meanders and is hard to follow. You may think that this is par for the course in the novels of Le Carre, but all I can say is that his better works like Spy Who Came In and Honourable Schoolboy have elements of this trickiness, but it is not overdone.  There is a certain tendency in modern English novelists--I'm thinking of people like Martin Amis--to give the reader a hard time, and in his later books Le Carre seems to be increasingly of the school of letting the reader try to figure out on his own what is going on in the book. My interpretation is that this is due to lazy writing, and the author losing sight of the reader. Others may disagree.  In earlier novels Le Carre leaned a great deal on what appeared to be inside knowledge of the espioniage business. Well, he had me convinced, anyway. Once he gets away from that territory, it seems to me that he is much more inauthentic.  My guess is that the character of Tiger Single is somewhat based on Le Carre's own father, who was something of a jet-set conman.  The book has plently of brilliantly witty  dialog, very much a Le Carre specialty, and passages of superb descriptive writing, so all is not lost, but I would only recommend it for the diehard Le Carre fan who has read everything else and has a lot of time on his/her hands 
 While I accept it does portrait quite well the anguish of a boy discovering he is gay and of unrequited love, the prose is absolutely inmature, simplistic in a way that could be acceptable in dialogue(which arent any better) but not in a character that age that is writting. It cannot be excused as the flow of the boy`s conscience either.   The repetitions of ideas, specially inconsequential ideas with the EXACTLY same words makes it tiresome. Also, there arent any hints for the reader to discover the "someone" before the main character does, which is un unforgivable flaw in a mistery novel. Especially considering all the rest of it is quite easy to predict.  The descriptions are, for lack of a better word, corny. The main character starts acting all manly but later suddenly changes his attitude in rather unbeliable way for a boy that age.  I would be way more forgiving if I hadnt payed for it 
 Great topic, but unfortunately very poorly written.  Although I appreciate the authors' attempt to explain their ideas without the use of equations (although a few simple ones would have been nice), the book lacks organization, and is replete with repeated ideas.  I don't know if it really adds anything new to what's out there already.  
 I bought this vacuum after a series of decidedly poor vacuums, thinking that (being a college student, this was expensive!) a little bit more money might yield better results.  The first two run-throughs, this worked incredibly - I'd never seen such sucking power!  The swivel was mighty, the light on the front was a big improvement on my old vacuum, and the thing picked up everything in sight in one fell swoop (no running over a spot again and again).  Then, the third time, there were rubbery odors, my cat's hair remained permanently pressed into the rug, and a simple bit of confetti was not even touched when I ran over it.    Upon opening the vacuum, the belt was absolutely CHARRED!  I'm going to try replacing the belt and see how long it lasts, but I fear (after reading other reviews of this item) that I'm going to be in the market for another vacuum...AGAIN!  Sending the thing back to Dirt Devil would cost me more than it's worth...  NEVER buy anything like this without reading online reviews first (stupid me in the cleaning aisle at Target) 
 Our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up. He could not wait to get this belt. We had purchased the police uniform earlier. The first time I ordered the belt, it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it. When it finally arrived, he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long. It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it. It is less than 4 weeks old and probably won't make it through the rest of the month 
 In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism

 This book tells some very interesting stories about the crazy life of being in such a popular band and all the usuals that go along with it: groupies, drugs, etc.  The thing that annoyed me about this book is Marilyn Manson's belief that society somehow molded him into becoming the person that he is or that he is a product of extreme circumstances (he references always being reminded that he was different).  While his childhood was definitely not what most people think of as normal, I got the impression that he is who he is by personal choice and nothing else.  This does give a sense of empowerment in the way that it says to people, you can be as different as you want to be without having to have an excuse for it.  However, this isn't the message this book tries to deliver; this book claims that it's not about choice it's about cause and effect (at least in my opinion).  So if you're just looking for an entertaining look into a different world, then this book will deliver.  But if you're looking for some insight into the human personality that some of the other reviewers seem to think is here, keep looking 
 the only thing i liked about this book was the introduction. i am a white, professional, upper middle class female, 40 years old.  there wasn't any story that i could relate to.  most of the women went to ivy league schools, or at least seemed very upper class and snobby.  i can't imagine many people really relating if i couldn't.  also a story about a woman who had sex with her best friends boyfriend and struggles with the idea that that friendship ended...hmmmm, what a surprise! i can't think of anything more ridiculous and boring to read about.  get real.  that's what i say about the whole book 
 My daughter is "into" the Civil War so I bought this book for her.  I read it first and am glad I did.  I cannot recommend it.  It is boring and has very little suspense.  I know the Civil War was a sad and serious time, but familied still had some happy times in the midst of it!  Cass, the main character's younger sister, has visions and all sorts of weird things.  I do not want to expose my children to that. Another character also reads cards and supposedly has second sight.  These things are occultic to me.  Therefore I cannot recommend this book at all 
 I installed one of these in my aquarium this weekend and sat back looking forward to lush greenery in my tank.  The system is a sturdy canister in which you mix sugar, yeast, a "stabilizing agent" and water.  These do their thing and the gas comes through a tube down into a bubble track that makes the bubbles zig zag up, exposing them to the water for as long as possible.  Good concept and I'd read pretty good reviews.  But here's the problem.  The track affixes to the wall of your tank with suction cups which create a narrow gap between the tank wall and the track.  I noticed my tetras were getting in there, but since they were getting back out I didn't worry.  Then this morning I found one of the larger females firmly stuck.  I thought she was dead until I released her.  She swam off with an ugly red mark where the thing had caught her.  I hope she's OK.  I removed this death trap from my tank and am seeking safer ways to diffuse the CO2 in my tank.    The canister thing is nice, though, particularly if you're not handy enough to make an airtight seal with a DIY soda bottle system.  It might get another star for that, but seeing how it injured and could've killed one of my fish, I'd like to give it 0.    UPDATE 11/30/06:  After several aquarist friends insisted that I must have improperly installed my diffuser, I tried again, this time making sure the suction cups were squeezed as flat as possible, and one of my friends checked it and assured me that this time there was just not enough space to admit even a small fish.  Two days later, I checked the diffuser and there was an otocinclus trapped behind it.  This one was dead.  Find a better way to feed your plants 
 In the years since September 11th, 2001 many authors have tried their hands at the 9/11 novel, with all of its delicate subject matter, and thus far they have met with only limited degrees of success: Jonathan Safran Foer, Julia Glass, Wendy Wasserstein, and others have centered novels on the pre- and post-9/11 era, and now Claire Messud takes her turn with "The Emperor's Children," a novel set during the months preceding and immediately following that horrific day. The titular 'emperor' is Murray Thwaite, a prestigious journalist living the quintessential Manhattan lifestyle: fame, money, parties, and the adoration of literati and socialites alike. He has cultivated an image based on truth and integrity, although those charactersitics are notably lacking in his actual person. His 'children' are the people immediately surrounding him, captivated by his presence and hoping to coast on his celebrity with varying degrees of maliciousness. At the novel's onset most of them are suffering from some form of paralysis about their life's direction. First and foremost is Marina, Murray's daughter, who seems hopelessly trapped in a prolonged adolescence -- afraid that if she grows up and tries to make her way in the world she will be unable to live up to her famous father's reputation (the thought of disappointing him is particularly troubling to her). It is easy to forget that Marina is 30 years old because she is quite deliberately written like a high school aged socialite. Then there is Murray's nephew, Frederick "Bootie" Tubb,  who has grown up in awe of his distant uncle and comes to Manhattan after dropping out of college to ask him to be his mentor. Bootie, an intelligent but overly philosophical and idealistic young man, quickly becomes disillusioned with Murray (for who could possibly live up to the lofty expectations that celebrity produces?), and becomes determined to expose his uncle for the charlatan he believes him to be. Complicating things further is Ludovic Seeley, a smarmy Australian businessman who has come to Manhattan to start his own magazine -- and aims to shake up the existing journalistic order by dethroning the reigning king. Ludovic is such an arrogant cliche that all he needs is a mustache to sinisterly twirl to be an outright cartoon. Lastly, there are Marina's best friends: Julius, a gay hanger-on from chilly Michigan eager to make an impression on the New York social scene, and Danielle, who is presumably the humane center for the novel to pivot on, but suffers from such ludicrous Ally McBeal-esque crises in her love life that her credibility is dangerously suspect after the first hundred pages. The characters are uniformly pretentious and are alternately mildly and seriously annoying, but Messud manages to propel her novel forward despite their intrinsic unlikability because, as shallow as they are, they are all multi-layered, complex, believable people. The many threads comprising the narrative are expertly weaved together for some compelling character studies (even if you wouldn't necessarily want to hang out with the lot of them). But that willingness to stick with their stories is, at least for me, predicated on the belief that they will be changed people by the novel's end. They aren't. And while the narrative is expertly crafted, Messud has a penchant for overusing commas in her prose that becomes, increasingly, irritating, as she uses them to stretch out her sentences, and to add separate thoughts, or descriptive elements, and even, occasionally, dialogue, so that they feel like run-ons, like this one right here, this example I've devised for you, but are, for the most part, technically, grammatically sound, even though you may have to re-read the most trying sentences a second time, just to figure out what she is saying, without letting all of her distractions get in the way.   Messud does an admirable job building suspense as the chapters go by and September 11th draws near. There is a great degree of foreshadowing to be found, some directly indicating that September will be a month of great change, what with Ludovic's magazine set to launch on the 13th and a wedding to take place, but naturally none of the characters can predict just how fateful the month will prove to be. The sense of impending disaster looms large in "The Emperor's Children," and it is quite unfortunate that the novel loses steam when tragedy actually strikes. Indeed, 9/11 is almost anticlimactic when it occurs, serving merely as a catalyst to wrap up everyone's story lines. It was unbearably annoying to endure the outrageously selfish way that the characters responded to the attacks and the gross loss of life that they witnessed. In the late afternoon of that day, after the towers had fallen and Manhattan's skyline was irrevocably altered forever there wasn't a lot of soul searching going on in the hearts and minds of these characters. All they care about are their own petty problems and how the terrorists ruined their carefully planned calendars (I felt like throwing the book across the room in disgust when Ludovic had the audacity to go on a tirade about how his precious magazine's launch had to be cancelled). I live in the tri-state area, about an hour and a half away from Ground Zero, and the events of that day and the intense mourning that followed will be with me for the rest of my life, and what Messud has critically failed to capture is the way that 9/11 actually brought a grieving city closer together for a brief moment in time, and how for once people put aside their petty complaints to work on the larger issue at hand. I remember crying at work alongside my stunned colleagues and the reassuring hugs we gave each other, the phone calls I made to -- and received from -- people I hadn't even spoken to in months or even years, just to make sure that they were all right. I remember the eagerness with which people helped each other out, whether the need was great or small. This incredible outbreak of brotherly love earned the admiration of the world, but it is conspicuously absent from Messud's telling. One character uses the tragedy for personal gain career-wise, one uses it as an excuse to wallow in self pity (not for anything to do with 9/11, mind you, but for strictly personal reasons) ... I don't want to give too much away by outlining the callous behavior that offended me so much, but in my opinion it was woefully inappropriate. I had hoped that tragedy would change the Emperor and his Children for the better, but I was wrong. And it's a shame. Messud is definitely a capable, promising writer -- but this isn't her finest hour 
 Hush is a shallow and blatant 'monster mash' of characters disguising itself as an epic. culminate Batman story. Everything from Lee's generic and derivative character re-imagings (like what you'd expect to find in something produced by Image comics) to the plot. And by plot, I mean the tiringly episodic reintroduction of a character followed by quick battle and then 'on to the next one', sequence that only stops at the unveiling of a new, non compelling villain. In other words, if you're into mainstream american comics, you'll love this. If you want a real Batman story, Check out "Long Halloween," Alan Moore's "Killing Joke", Frank Miller's 'Dark Knight Returns" and Neil Gaiman's "Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth 
 What is this novel, The Marble Faun, that so many have said they "just simply must read" before travelling to the continent?  There seems to be some confusion about it, not only in my mind, but in the minds of others as well.  I know, at least that the publishers have had their questions.  Why else would they be unable to agree on a title?  Even though they may have agreed to publish the book, the British publishers spoke their mind at least and changed the author's title to Transformations.  After publication I'm sure they had wished that they had changed more than that.  It seems that the publishers also had to search for a selling point for the novel.  The prose alone could not carry sales, so they have added photographs and made it "the great travel book of our age".  Of course, I dare say people are buying the book more for the pictures than for the story itself.  The anticipation of seeing the piazza where Hilda's tower stands has intrigued the reader more than the murder, and the characters' subsequent transformations and loss of innocence ever could.   The story itself, centering around the actions of the four characters seems long and confused.  The characters float between scenes acting as they would anywhere else; the changing backdrops seem to act only as a way of keeping the travelling reader's attention.  Although Hawthorne makes sure you see that the four characters do in fact change (in such chapters as "The Faun's Transformation"), the characters seem to be simply caricatures, over-exaggerated looks at one type of person.  This is also accentuated by Hawthorne's use of epithets - such as "The Sculptor", "The Dove," and "The Faun".  Because of this the book has the air of being a presentation of four friends' romp through Italy, rather than being the intricate tale of four characters' lives and relationships.  One may wonder why Hawthorne chose to publish the Marble Faun in one volume rather than serially, as is common for his contemporaries.  The answer to me seems clear.  If a reader were to ever put this book down, he would not have the heart to pick it up again 
 Naturally, I was quite excited when I first heard that a new book about Hekate had been published. While there is plenty of material from academic publishers, there's really a great need for a book aimed at the Pagan audience. The book I would like to see would be written by someone with a good grasp of the primary sources and some familiarity with ancient Greek religion, and would contain suggestions for how to honor Hekate both in a traditional manner, and within the context of Wicca and other neo-Pagan religions. Let's just say that "Crossroads" ain't it.  First off, the author has not done his homework. He accuses "conventional" scholars of ignoring or misrepresenting Hekate, but the only name he mentions is Edith Hamilton. Apparently he is not familiar with the wealth of information printed in books and academic journals from the 19th century onwards, which is inexcusable since much of it is still in print, reprinted or even available online. Robert von Rudloff and Sarah Iles Johnston are listed in the bibliography, but Crowfoot has only bothered to read "Hekate Soteira", which has a rather narrow focus, while leaving out "Restless Dead" which would have been better suited to his purpose. He quotes Krauss, but only as Krauss is quoted by Iles Johnston.  As for the primary sources, Crowfoot draws much from the Theogony and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (which he mistakenly attributes to Homer). The problem is that he fails to put things in their proper context. While he often gets the basic facts right his interpretation is just as often wrong, because he lacks knowledge of ancient Greek religion and culture. For instance, Crowfoot is obviously not aware that myth and cult don't always agree. He also doesn't deal well with seemingly conflicting stories, such as those dealing with Hekate's different genealogies. Instead of realizing that different myths can illuminate different aspects of a deity's nature he attempts to create a nice, neat, picture which is just not impressive in a book that claims to be a "ground-breaking" work.  The bibliography is a joke. Crowfoot appears to work under the assumption that all sources are created equal, and as a result much of the information in "Crossroads" is taken from web pages credited to "Unknown"...  In conclusion, "Crossroads" is not historically accurate, does not present any revelations, and the claim that it should offer a correct interpretation of Hekate is outright laughable.  
 I found that the book, Becoming A Master Manager, to not be very helpful in an Introduction to Management course.  Although the idea behind this book is good and for the most part helpful, it is not adequate for the type of course I am currently taking.  The idea of having each chapter focus on the different managerial roles is one that could potentially be very helpful.  Since each section contains various compentencies that focus on different aspects of these roles, this book could be helpful for a course that was structured differently.  However, since our class is structured toward the basic fundamentals of management, this book is somewhat useless.  To be honest, I did not really look at this book extensively because I had another book that worked better for this class.  I just felt it was not worth my time to continue with this book, since it did not help me in my studies 
 Make sure that you want to buy this type of book.  It was not at all what I was expecting 
 Mr. O'Nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing.  His skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people, events, etc., is downright frustrating and confuses the project.  Unlike superior literary treatments (see Walter Lord's TITANIC), this book leave you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long, hot shower.  
 I never read Madeline books as a child and was captivated by them when I started reading them to my child.  I was very excited to make this book a part of my holiday book collection. However I should have read this one before buying!This one makes no sense, its hardly about Christmas at all and the usual charming rhymes are not there. Check this one out at the library before buying 
 The machine works as advertised but I was very dissapointed in the quality of construction.  While I fully understood that the machine was constructed of plastic and not metal i did expect that the plastic pieces comprising the body of the machine to properly fit together.  The machine was a gift and so I could not return it otherwise I WOULD HAVE 
 No joke, I've heard multiple tapes of events he's spoken at (as well as attended one) and he openly states this movie bites.  Those rating 3, 4 or lm*o 5 stars are "Fan Boys".  Don't get me wrong, I like S.King's stuff (It, Misery, Pet Sematary for example) but this one is to be avoided 
 I thought this book would be chapter legnth stories by people who visited paris. Instead, it is more like a listing of places to stay, places to eat. There were some essays, most a page or two, but they were not helpful. One example of an essay was a professor from New York who wrote how the French are rude. Another 2 page essay was on "cheap places to eat", but the cheapest resturant was over $75.     I want to enjoy my trip, not start out finding things not to like. 
 This item was a big disappointment and a waste of money for me.  I love TamiLee and her Arms and Abs video from a few years ago.  That's why I was excited to see what I thought was a newer production of Arms and Abs workouts.  The cover was different than the video and there was no reference to the older video in the description, so I thought the DVD contained all new workouts.  The 3 Arms and Abs workouts were exactly the same as the old video, so did me no good.  I didn't buy the DVD for the lower body workouts, but viewed them just to see what they were.  Two out of three are somehow cued incorrectly from the DVD menu, meaning you select workout 2, for example, and the DVD takes you to the cool down session from workout number 1!  Because sequential workout video tapes are still easier to use for home-exercisers than DVDs since you don't have to remember which workout you are on - you just stop the tape one day and restart the tape another day - this DVD is just a back-up for the tape I already use 
 this movie sucks. ending is predictable. the line about being as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton was ALMOST good. Reservoir Dogs--now there's a heist film 
 Having read the book, I was astounded that the author has missed the point of the original published statistical paper on the Bible Code. What he has shown is that the Bible does not contain a hidden message at any particular  skip code. The Bible Code is not at any particular skip sequence, but is  single words in different skip patterns in close proximity. His computer  code, though interesting, disproves what no one claims. Read Cracking the  Bible Code for a more scientific and clear explaination of the Bible Code  debate 
 Although often touted as a horror comedy, the most amusing aspect of this 1997 direct-to-video clunker is the fact that it is often confused with its saccharine family-flick namesake, a commensurately clunky and similarly themed Michael Keaton vehicle released in theaters the following year. Interestingly, the titular character of each film is a snowman that has somehow come to life. However, those planning a nice evening with the youngsters will be in for quite a shock if they purchase or rent the wrong movie. The snowy dude in Keaton's film is a benevolent father figure who wants to help out his real-life family; the icy hombre in the 1997 horror flick is animated by the soul of an escaped convict with a penchant for rape and murder.  Outside of the amusing thought of 1997's JACK FROST getting an accidental showing at a kiddie party, this film has very little to offer. The special FX are amateurish, the script is so inane that it is nearly impossible to suspend one's disbelief for the duration, and much of the acting is horrid. While some films can be admired for their cheesiness--Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD (1981) comes immediately to mind--JACK FROST falls way beneath even THAT standard. Writer-director Michael Cooney seems unable to decide if he wants to spoof the horror genre--there are scenes that mimic horror cliches but few, if any, that parody or satirize them--or simply make, a la Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984), a scary film with humorous characters and an amusing premise. The film vacillates between both styles without gaining sufficient footing in either, and the result is a slushy thematic jumble that is neither scary nor entertaining.  JACK FROST is not without a few near-redeeming qualities, however. There are lots of amusing Python-esque puns and jokes sprinkled throughout the film, the kind of verbal gags that make you simultaneously chuckle and...well, GAG. And this film also marks the cinematic debut of gorgeous actress Shannon Elizabeth, who here has some, ah, revealing moments with the eponymous snowman. Unfortunately, these elements do not elevate the film enough to make it worth wasting an hour-and-a-half of one's life.  Don't be fooled by the artwork on the DVD's packaging--that cool skull made of snow does not appear in the film. In truth, 1997's JACK FROST is an ice-cold stinker that few discerning horror fans will want to add to their collections 
 One word: boring. This book took 40 pages just to describe people dying everywhere and that the remaining survivors ended up in a hall together. After that, no zombie-killing action for the next 100 pages or so. All of it went something like this: "We were all scared. We didn't know what to do. Michael showed signs of irritation at the group's indecisiveness. How could dead bodies move? Some of us wanted to leave, others wanted to stay here. The whole world was coming to an end." Way too much imagery about their surroundings and emotions but not enough horror element to warrant this as a horror novel. Makes a good read for people who just want to throw away their time at amateur work that offers nothing particularly interesting. The spotlight review written by "citymars" is yet another testimony to the points I'm trying to make.   If you really like this or want to see for yourself what I meant, you can download a free ebook version at David Moody's website. Other titles that ARE actually worth reading are: "The Rising" by Brian Keene and "The Walking Dead" series by Robert Kirkman. 
 Due to Roiphe's insufferable tendency to place each of her personal experiences in the context of global events, I was completely exhaused by chapter two 
 I heard the author discussing this book on NPR and was fascinated by the premise.  However, just as a cook may have all the necessary ingredients on the counter, if s/he doesn't mix them together properly and allow to simmer until just right, the meal can be ruined.  This is what happened with Brad Meltzer's THE BOOK FATE.  He had all the makings of an excellent thriller:  inside details on the life of a former president, information on presidential libraries, facts about the inner workings of the CIA, FBI, and Secret Service, travel and intrigue, and some vaguely interesting though random information about Freemasonry.  When he stirred it all together what he ended up with was a weak concoction lacking spice or salt and full of superfluous ingredients that didn't need to be there.   The back cover of the book compares Meltzer to David Baldacci, Scott Turow, and John Grisham.  These writers know what to do with the ingredients to turn out one fantastic dish of a book; Meltzer's BOOK OF FATE is a heavy, overstuffed souffle that refused to rise 
 Like a previous reviewer I was also disappointed by the content of the book.  Made up of articles (albeit slightly changed) appearing in magazines, this book provided nothing new or indepth or of a different viewpoint from other fitness/cycling/triathlon books.  I wouldn't recommend to buy it.  Coffee book material it is.  if you want to get anything out of it and apply it to any training, then this isn't the book for you 
 To anyone who knows the real history of the European part of WWII, this is an idiotic premise for a book.  In America--and nowhere else in the world--they teach that America, with help from the Soviets, defeated Nazi Germany.  This is propaganda  and makes us a laughingstock for our naivete.  In truth, while we were fighting the Japanese, and crushing their hopes beyond repair in the Battle of Midway, making it only a matter of how long it would take, not who would win, the Russians did the same thing to the Nazis in the Battle of Stalingrad and surrounding areas.  One huge difference is that while the U.S. lost between 292,000 and 400,000 dead in the entire war, the Russians lost beween 20 and 30 MILLION dead.  (Ponder that for awhile.  I find it incomprehensible.)  Unimaginable numbers of men, women and children died in and around Stalingrad, and the old beast Stalin--in perhaps the only completely truthful statement of his life--said, "They are not fighting for me and they are not fighting for Communism.  They are fighting for Mother Russia."  He was right.  When the 12-to-18 month battle was over, the Russians' fatalities far outnumbered those of the Nazis.  But the Russian people's courage--aided enormously by the climate that had doomed Napoleon, and supplies and food from the U.S.--destroyed a majority of Hitler's army.  The Nazis were in full retreat back through Eastern Europe, forcibly conscripting 15-year-old Poles to fight in what remained of their great army.  All of this was well BEFORE D-Day.  If you read American newspapers from November of 1943, you can read about conferences between FDR, Churchill (my pick for the greatest person of the century) and Stalin--discussing what they would do when the war ended.  In other words, they knew victory was a done deal--over half a year before D-Day.  So, this book is another effort to say the U.S. military played a major effort in defeating Nazi Germany.  That is a lie which every country in the rest of the world scorns us for believing.  In World War II, we did the following things:  (1)  Defeated a Japanese government & military not much better than Hitler's.  While we had help (as did the Russians in their immense sacrifice), we were clearly the main force in the Pacific, just as were the Russians in Europe;  (2)  Kept Stalin from metastasizing his way through the rest of Europe;  (3)  Hastened the war's end, a big deal.  Nobody will ever know how much longer Hitler needed to get the doomsday bomb, but we all know what he would have done, as those Russian tanks smashed their way through those final blocks toward his bunker, if he'd had the doomsday button at his command; and   (4)  Lost the lives of 292,000-400,000 courageous souls, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of others who came home with what is now called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (a major mental disorder) and/or serious physical injuries.  I am not disparaging any of those sacrifices, nor trivializing Items (1) through (3), nor (of course) our defeating Japan.  But this country REALLY has to get past the notion we beat the Nazis or co-beat them.   We didn't, any more than the Soviets co-beat Japan.  A year ago, I heard an idiot on ESPN tout some movie about D-Day, a movie which was to air that night on their parent network, ABC.  He referred to D-Day as, "The most important battle of World War Two."  There are a lot of places in Europe where one would not want to be heard making that statement, and only people "educated" about history in American schools could in good faith state such nonsense.  This book, sadly, will only carry on this tradition of ignorance through propaganda.  The conspiracy to kill Hitler had been in its formative stages well before D-Day, for the reason its major participants had already known Germany was hopelessly beaten.    Here is what all reasonable people can agree upon:  (A)  It is a great tragedy the bomb failed to do its job, for it would have saved many millions of lives; and  (B)  It is too bad Rommel, a man deeply respected by many American military leaders, went down with the ship, because I don't believe he would have failed again.  Moreover, he obviously knew Stalingrad had destroyed the great Nazi machine, and that the combined wraths of the Russians/Soviets over Stalingrad, and the British over The Blitz in 1940-1941, would take a horrible toll on the Germans at the hands of their victors.  And he was sure right.    Americans nowadays argue over the morality of Truman's two atom bombs, with the vast majority of those who were not alive then condemning him for ordering the bombings.    I agree they are a fascinating subject for debate.  But I can tell you this:  I was born in 1953 and have asked well over 1,000 people in my life who were at least 21 on the date of Pearl Harbor how they felt about the dropping of those two bombs.  And I have NEVER found such a person who disagreed with the dropping of those atom bombs AT THE TIME, though many disagree with it now or disagreed with it later.  Not a single one disagreed with it in 1945.    But the firebombing of Dresden?  Not only does everyone I know now who knows about it condemn it as a clearly indefensible thing (which killed more people outright than either of those atom bombs), but most people I have known who were adults during World War II condemned it, too--not only to me, but when it happened way back then, finding no justification for it at whatsoever.  I apologize for using a monolithic subject with which to grade this book.  But it IS another book which perpetuates the lie that our military defeated or co-defeated the Nazis.  And our country's perpetuation of that myth/propaganda has done our country and its civilians a great disservice in the court of Western Culture's opinion.    I care a lot about that court's opinion of me and my country.  I don't care at all what Bin Laden and other fundamentalist Islamics think about me or my culture, any more than I care what Falwell and Robertson think about me.  But I am tired of having the rest of the Western World view Americans as naive idiots.    A book which perpetuates the notion our military defeated the Nazis will only help ensure that we continue to be seen--not only by Russians, but by all Europeans--as at least naive, if not idiots.

 My baby got this for Christmas.  He was about 7 months old.  Now, a couple months later, he still doesn't play with it.  My 3-year old doesn't play with it either and he loves most of our other "baby" toys.  This toy is just not that interesting.  I wish my mother-in-law would have saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful at all 
 This book is a review of the basic principles of design.  There are no photos of actual examples where all the principles and elements of design are displayed.  If you are looking for pictures of beautiful tables already  set, this book is not for you 
 What can I say? I bought this book looking for helpful information on my options to stay at home with my new son. What I got was a christian woman's story on her journey of staying at home. I didn't feel her story was helpful in my decision. I didn't feel inspired or get the "I can do this" attitude. I didn't like the references on praying and scriptures in the bible. I was simply disappointed with my purchase and wish I would've checked the library before I spent my money 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 The storyline was weak with very forgettable characters.  The heroine was a complaining inept airhead and her "Devirgination" should not take so long and then we have to listen to her complain about it for hours afterward.  And Georgie? who came across as a freakish stuttering child was reenactted by the narrator in an annoying stuttering whine.  One character was actually described has having a magnificent bosom what is that? I can't help but picture this poor "regency" woman toppling over to reach for her tea. 
 If you liked The One Minute Manager or Who Moved My Cheese, this is the book for you.  If, on the other hand, you believe that Management is a complex art that cannot be adequately covered with fairy tales, this book will annoy you 
 I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.   It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.  Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on.   Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.  Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.  Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".)   It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.   This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.   A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.  On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her.   As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.  These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.   Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.   It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.   So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.  There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.   I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.  For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not. 
 Dr. Steven Greer is a well-known figure on the fringe of UFOlogy, and he claims to have "briefed" senior government figures on the UFO issue, but five minutes with this book reveals why few take the issue seriously.  It's an amateurish, sometimes incoherent clip job of unedited, free-flowing interviews with dozens of scientists, pilots and former government/military figures, most of whom say they experienced a highly strange UFO episode (though some of the "testimony" is second-hand).   The firsthand stories can be very interesting and provocative, especially when they purport to cover the government's secrecy, suppression and disinformation techniques. But any impact the content might have is pretty much overshadowed by the hard fact that "Disclosure" is a disorganized, misspelled, contradictory, somrtimes unintelligible, incoherent mess. It's not even "written" in the strict sense -- it appears to be a bunch of interview transcripts hurriedly set in type, not subjected to so much as a simple spell-checker. Names and geographic locations are mangled, punctuation is absent, and the speakers' weird allusions are left hanging. It's hundreds of pages long, but it feels like the world's biggest high school social studies project.   The one consistent stylistic point is that Dr. Greer's name or initials appear over and over and over again -- nobody ever accused him of missing self-promotion opportunities -- but the amateurish nature of the production is a net negative mark against him. It's a mess.  In a foreword Greer says the material was/is so urgent, because it deals with the future of the entire human race, etc., that it had to be rushed into publication. I would like to think the definitive word on the future of the entire human race will be spelled right and look like it came from grown-ups.  Tragically disorganized efforts like "Disclosure" warm the hearts of the disinformation masters, I'm sure, because the UFO movement hangs itself with this kind of stuff -- or at least consigns itself to eternal fringe status. It's a serious subject and it deserves serious coverage, but "Disclosure," for all the nuggets of interest it contains, helps guarantee that the subject won't be taken seriously for the foreseeable future.   
 When I saw this book in Yale University bookstore, I was extremely thrilled to discover that a book on the aesthetics of architecture has been written. However, after reading the book, I was extremely disappointed to  find out that the book has wandered aimlessly in several directions, and  the author seemed to have many ideas, but most of them is not critically  discussed or permeable to the readers. The most distressed thing is that  the book wandered off in the direction of becoming a critical review of Las  Vegas and Venturi's seminal work, both Learning from Las Vegas and  Complexity and Contradiction. For one, Las Vegas is not the 'contentless'  city that the author subscribed to  presently. It is the ultimate event  city, and the author would discover that big events and 'situations' have  found their place within the this city. It might even seem contradictory  that this chapter on Las Vegas has worked conceptually against the main  idea of the book. However, the book finally picked up its pace in the last  chapter, when the author finally addressed the problem of overt aesthetics  in students' work today because of the homogeneity of computer usage. It  finally seemed that the last chapter is the first, and the book ended where  it should have started. Overall, there is some consistencies in the  arguement from Lebbeus Wood's drawings to several cultural theorists  arguement on aesthetics. There is also evidence of a resurgence in  Situationism, and the author has confidently picked up on this  trend.However, there is not enough reference to contemporary architecture  and aesthetics to warrant a serious look into this book 
 The copy I received does not have Geoffrey Brooks' name anywhere about it, though I would guess he is the translator.  The author is given as Albrech Wacker.  In the prologue, the author says "After the passage of so many years it is inevitable that many of his memories had become blurred and that only his most traumatic experiences had remained crystal clear in his mind, and the biographer was left to join up these pieces of information and to sort them into a coherent and readable narrative."  In other words, the author does not even claim factual accuracy.  He further indicates that 'Sepp Allerberger' is a pseudonym.  This is silly, because as a winner of the Knight's Cross, the protagonist should be fairly easily identifiable to any enthusiast willing to do the shovel work, assuming 'Allerberger' was one actual person.  Knowing what I do now, I would not have purchased this book, which I can only classify as a fairly good war novel 
 This art instruction manual is aptly titled as it is about "survival", offering hassle-free recipe- driven art projects for masses of students.  If you were a public school student in the last 40 years the projects will look depressingly familiar--the obligatory construction paper  mask, the linoleum block print, the paper mache' animal.  What is lacking is an overriding vision of what students may achieve.  The "goals" are largely stated by listing vocabulary words but the opportunities for real discovery are thin indeed.  As an art  teacher of 20 years, I would never rely on construction paper for collage as it is impossible to produce anything with richness from such flat uninteresting papers.  The student block print examples show the medium at its least interesting with the images mostly being reverse outline, little exploration of shape or figure-ground reversal.  Moreover, it is criminal that a book purporting to be about the development of the visual sense should have reproductions of such appalling quality.  Some of them are clearly printing errors since all one can see are dark gray rectangles with a few hints of light.  The student examples were grim and to me this is the book's greatest failing.  The strength of an art instruction book to me usually lies in the student examples.  Mona Brooks and Kaupelis (first name escapes me) produce inspiring books on the basis of their student work alone.  On a positive note, the book is well- organized.  It could possibly serve as a jumping off point to a teacher with experience and initiative, but for the most part it perpetuates the predictable, mind-numbing experience of the all-too typical  30 minute public school art block 
 This album is so wretched it made me laugh. In the store I looked at the artists and the songs and thought it would provide nice holiday music. I put it on when I got home and wondered if maybe Spike Jones had slipped in some joke tunes. I can't believe these people sound so bad. Sure, some of the numbers are very nice, but then you split a gut laughing at the others--or worse, cringing 
 Most of the moves go too quickly, does not give your muscles are full workout. If you want to remember the moves and work it on your own that's fine. But then again why don't you just buy a book and do it yourself?   The "sculpting stick" which does not include with the video, is not particularly useful to the type of workout suggested. With or without do the same.   Also, the three 12 mins workouts was too short to make the video worth its price. I'm sure there are plenty of workout videos out there with better pacing for a full workout on your muscles and longer selection recorded. For example, I tried Tamilee Webb's Abs, Arms and Legs of Steel, that is much better I think 
 I was disappointed at the dismissal of social scientific evidence in favour of a priori conservative christian observations about deviation from an a priori normative basis. Disturbingly, this seemed to be on the basis  that some forms of cult or new religious movement had too much in common  with fundamentalism's own authoritarianism, failure to respect intellectual  freedom (or "relativism". However, how else is one meant to  assess whether an NRM is harmful or not? Gomes fails to realise the  implications of social scientific or psychological studies that do show  such correspondences between authoritarian NRMs and fundamentalist  Christianity, while harmless and non-authoritarian religious traditions are  also included in this series solely on the basis of alleged philosophical  deviation, and no other reason. I don't think anyone outside fundamentalism  will be impressed with the latter criteria as sole basis. Moreover, it also  suffers from the relativist strawperson argument. And if the NRM is  politically conservative, it is interesting to note how much of that gets  let out of the Zondervan series, compared to liberal alternative religions  such as Unitarian Universalism 
 I first purchased the blue Shark Cordless sweeper which did not swivel. one day the cheap plastic connector where the handle bar meets the vac broke off. This was less than 30 days after I purchased it and honestly, I had used it about 4 or 5 times in that short period, simply for the tile floor in the kitchen.   When I went to return it at the local store, I saw the Shark 3 Speed version which swivels. I did an exchange and shelled out another $20 bucks thinking that maybe this one would be better since the 3 speed version swivels. SHAME ON ME! It took only about 20 days to break the handle in the same spot on this one. I was turning the handle to manuver around a corner and hit the corner with the edge of the Shark and off broke the handel in the SAME SPOT! I would be honest to tell you if I had really slammed the vac hard against the corner but that is not the case at all. I returned it and got my money back ... no exchange this time.    
 Pro ---  * Compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket, yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys, including a number row.  For those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets, this is decidedly a deal-maker over the Stowaway keyboard which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols. The full-size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the Freedom Keyboard. To my knowledge, there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row.  * The bluetooth connection is clean, lag free, and accurate.   Con ---  * The software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome, requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use, and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement (see below).  * Flimsy Locking Mechanism / Not Usable on a Lap.   The manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat "while on your lap or on a non-flat surface". This "lock" is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip, which travels 7/8" along the top of the board from the left half into the right. Even when locked, the keyboard doesn't lay flat, and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user's legs, held in place only by one thin piece of wire, the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated "V" shape after any amount of light-handed typing.  HP could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics. A user must find a solid flat surface to type on, such as a book. And of course, when sitting on a flat surface, the lock isn't needed.   * The manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to "enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your...PocketPC". Unfortunately, the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle. A quick look at the Freedom Keyboard's pull-out cradle offers HP a lesson in how to do it right.   * The keyboard ships with no case, as do most other portable keyboards with non-rugged exteriors. The attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys.  * It doesn't turn off.   Yes, you read that last bullet correctly: You can't turn this thing off. There's no power switch.   The button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld; it's not a power switch.  What this means is, even when folded and not in use, even when appearing to be dormant, and even when the software shows that there's no bluetooth connection,  the keyboard is still eating your batteries.   The automatic "sleep mode" simply disables the wireless connection; it does not power down the keyboard. Two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard, you'll return to find them dead. Not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes.  The only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries. The battery cover, need I add, breaks easilly.  Sound unbelievable? Go to the major websites dedicated to PocketPCs, and do a search of their forums using the keywords "bluetooth keyboard". This is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual. The manual, such as it is, makes no mention of an absent power switch.   For the mobile user then, in addition to the keyboard itself, one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on, to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired, to carry the batteries separately, and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those  batteries. Although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket, the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user.  Add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use, the HP iPaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1/3 it's $100 retail price, and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row.   How HP ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me. All potential buyers of iPaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what, if any, emphasis HP places on quality of design and the integrity of iPaq name.  It reflects also the degree of respect HP has for the intelligence of their customers. One might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle, or the parsimony of not including a case. One might even forgive the useless locking mechanism. But when HP is either too dumb to include an on/off switch, or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care, then I must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the iPaq name.  If HP is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $100, then I cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a PocketPC for $300-400.  My next handheld upgrade, I'll probably stay with Fujitsu-Siemens Loox (I currently use a Loox720, a truly excellent PPC), or maybe go with a Dell Axim. I won't even consider an iPaq.   The HP Bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality.  Those at HP responsible for protecting public perception of the iPaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves. 
 This book should only be read by master level film students highly interested in every single director, film and plot summary of every movie ever made.  There are no summaries of the main points and this book should NEVER be used as a college core classroom book.  I have never been so bored and overwhelmed by such trivial and useless information in my life 
 I found the book had some ideas that helped, but it was unrealistic in many ways.  I am spiritual, but I didn't appreciate the religious opinion it gave 
 This is the only Robert Crais novel I ever read that I didn't like.  I had to push myself to finish it.  It features all the minutia about bank robbing --it's like the author read a book on the subject--  and the least likeable characters he's ever created.    Spare yourself the annoyance of reading this and read "The Watchman" instead.  
 The author attempts to confront her rape, beating, and abuse by men in her life but she avoids her own anger and rage about the male violence perpetrated onto her.  She remains the "good girl" and subsumes  her anger into a semantic term "fierce" compassion.  The title of  the book is rather "nice girl forgives once again".  Except now  she learned from her male roshies that growing up to womanhood means we no  longer need to be silent provided we forgive.  And since we are not  compassionate enough to kill all violent males, we cannot do much more than  laugh at our own anger.  What's so fierce or compassionate about that 
 I agree with those that say this book would be more useful if it came with solutions.  Right off in the first chapter, hypothetical situations are presented without any background information in the text.  If you haven't had some experience in Accounting, you are going to be left scratching your head.  The instructor in my class says that it causes you to think.  Hard to think if you have never come close to experiencing anything that is being discussed.  Some guidance would be helpful 
 First of all, I just wanted to comment that I am a huge fan of the Polseen universe and Mr. Ringo's body of work. Well, except for this book.   The characterizations were not engaging, the action sequences lacked "snap", the overall plot was rather tiresome and the ending was very disappointing. Actually the ending is horrid. What I did enjoy was learning a bit more about the "Elves" as well as brushing against some other aspects of the Polseen universe and its history.   Mr. Ringo is a skilled storyteller who has brought me countless hours of happy reading. I look forward to what comes out next in the Polseen universe but I have to recommend that people skip this book 
 One example will illustrate how this author knowingly misuses data to mislead his audience.  He points to the statistical density of Los Angeles as evidence that density does not provide the benefits typically associated with it (less gas use, etc.).  In doing so, he ignores tha fact that LA is built to its perimeter, and thus has a high AVERAGE density compared to many other cities, since those cities contain a much denser core surrounded by vast undeveloped areas.  LA's high average density bears little relationship to its lack of localized high densities, which are what confer benefits like less gas use.  Breugmann knows this, but he chooses to misuse the data to support his own contrarian enterprise, and in so doing, he gives the sprawl juggernaut one more foot up.  I personally know sprawl developers who use this intellectually bankrupt book to fight grassroots citizen opposition.  As Apu on the Simpsons would say, "Breugmann very bad man."  He is the no-global-warming scientist for the sprawl set 
 I was disappointed that the Baby Alive doll came with so few diapers but cost so much. My daughter could play with it for about an hour until we ran out of accessories and the doll was put on the shelf. I've since bought preemie diapers, but you'd think that since the whole idea of the doll is the eating and pooping, it would come with more to handle the fun 
 This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased 
 Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine? Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman in America but all I hear is American educational institutions praising Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience". I don't deny that he has made some points worth considering in his book but many people have made the same points without whining and railing at humanity.  I would dearly like to say I had the patience to read this book all the way through but it is perhaps the only book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.   The phrase that most ran through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was "o'erweening arrogance". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way.  I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.  I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted. So, I'd love to pepper my "critique" with quotes that I found completely offensive and juvenile but that would mean getting the book again and I *really* don't want to do that 
 I read this book when I was actually in Borneo where I spent over a year, visiting many of the places described in the book. I found it plainly ridiculous! The real Borneo is nothing like the mystical "deepest-darkest" fantasy-world described in this story, nor was it even when those travels were supposedly taking place... It is amazing that this book got such good marks from other readers and probably the best example of how many high tales a writer can get away with about far-away places where most readers haven't been. :-)  A more realistic description of the same places on a similar trip could be read in "A Stroll Through Borneo" by James Barclay 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
  This movie is the BIG LIE logic attempting to prove itself again.  Most despotic criminals use a BIG LIE concept to manipulate those in society with the weakest minds a lame too often used mold from which Stan "Tookie" Williams is cut.  This DVD is nothing more than a BIG LIE! that ranks right up there with NAZI BIG LIE era Triumph Of The Will.  Like any monster Tookie spent his life hating the nasty reprobate aspects that defined his hearts core while hurting others to cover up the fact he lacked strength to confront and overcome demons who likely at birth began consuming his black heart.  This DVD should be brought so you can look directly into the face of a demon and see how BIG LIES told on a grand scale can most effectively prevert truth beyond recognition infecting minds hearts and souls.  Even if Stan Tookie" Williams is just responsible for "Helping Create" the Crips gang that in itself is enough to earn him the one way trip on the needle express in my book.  That he writes a few lame anti-gang kiddie books and played his con-game to perfection on 60 Minutes, "convicing soft headed bleeding heart liberals that he is, redeemed" is of no consequence whatsoever.  Tookie was a heartless murderer of whole neighborhoods.  Tookie by helping create his gang murdered the dreams of countless thousands of innocent children made victims of drive by shootings.  Tookie helped to utterly destroy thousands of urban inner city poor families usually those most ill prepared for the assult he used to lay waste what little they had.  Tookie raped minds and whole communities holding each hostage at gun point to his perverted twisted desires and whims and a few good deeds no matter how heartfelt do not de-fang this monster of the first order.  Tookie Williams was nothing more than a domestic terrorist superimposed on a gangsta thug dope dealer's reality.  In the end Tookie Williams got what he deserved a needle ride to Hell's Gate if there is any enternal justice.  Buy this Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story DVD if you want to see the modern day media formula for exploiting weak minds at work.  I look at Stan Tookie William's and all I see is just another a weak minded pathetic monster who underwent his "caged creep conversion" but in truth the gang of thugs he spawned go on their merry murderous way.  When I saw this DVD on Stan "Tookie" Williams he reminded me of Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts who like the crips were just gangs of common thugs who murdered as much for fun as profit.)  This is a good DVD because Jamie Foxx captured the heart and soul of what it means to be an unrepentant psychopathic, self absorbed social parasite in Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story.  If Tookie gets a Nobel Prize I think he should be forced to share it with Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts) as they were in essentially the same business of neighborhood destruction, child killing, weak mind exploitation and death for fun or profit 
 This book was obviously not written from experience. Minnery pretends to be an expert, but falls way short and even shorter as an author. I've read non-fiction accounts that have far more useful information in a few  paragraphs than this whole book has. A real disappointment, don't waste  your money or time 
 The nature/nurture debate has been raging since the beginning of Psychology research (and indeed before) and the body of literature on the subject can support both views.  Most experts agree, however, that is MUST be a combination of both nature AND nurture.  This book completely dismisses the notion that parents have lasting influence on their child's long-term development saying instead that peers are the shaping influence.  As both a youth worker and a graduate student, I have seen first hand through academic literature and experience the importance of parents in the development of their children.  To completely reject the notion that they affect their children's long-term development is simply impossible.  Think of yourself as a thirteen-year-old; which would hurt you more:  a slap on the face from your best friend or your parent?  Another important fact to consider is the fact that Harris is not a PhD, not a recognized expert in the field, and not a member of the American Psychological Association.  In other words, she is not in good standing with her psychologist peers.  True, she has been published in both book and journal mediums, but if someone is to dismiss a major claim in the field of Psychology it should be an expert.  Having read the book, I find it to be an easy read and interesting.  I worry that parents will read this book and abandon their children emotionally because the book says they have no lasting impact.  This book cannot be used as an excuse for poor parenting- if so, this generation is in deep trouble.    I encourage readers to also examine the books Hurt (Chap Clark, 2005), A Secure Base (John Bowlby, 1990), and Raising Cain (Kindlon & Thompson, 2000) 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Season 1 of Veronica Mars took me by surprise, and I really enjoyed the ride.   The second season, however, doesn't live up to the quality of the first.  Instead of one large mystery, in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve.  There's nothing wrong with that approach, but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved, another would pop right up without any resolution for the first.  Many episodes ended with my friends and I turning to one another and asking, "Is that it?  Where's the rest of it?"  This happened quite a bunch, with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring.  Are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as Veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a weird slap on the wrist?  That's totally out of character, yet we never see that family, the abused girl, or hear about the incident again.      That type of confusion and weird plot points kept popping up.  The "major" villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer, and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable.    Because of the all the loose ends, go-nowhere plots, and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline, I'm giving Season 2 a 2 star rating.  Season 2 of Veronica Mars still has some funny dialogue, and some clever episodes, but it doesn't deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews I've seen.  I'll continue to watch, however, as Veronica Mars has a lot of promise.  Hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season 3 
 Save your money and buy a beatuty product instead.  This book is very repetative and has not much content.  You can find more and better info on the net.  In my opinion produce is much too expensive to be used as beauty products.  I would rather eat it.  I do not feel like putting milk on myself, lemons everwhere, drinking diluted vinegar, scrubbing with coffee grounds.  Yeah you cover up dark roots on your hair with eyeshadow. If you heard the promo on TV about what was in the book that is about it that is it not much more info.      In case we did not get it the first time they keep repeating the same thing over and over and over again 
 I find that Michael Moore in his films often pushes the envelope on fair-play and reality and I sometimes question his methods.  When I ordered this movie, I thought it might be a humorous lambasting of Moore's films pointing out any crucial mistakes he made in presenting his case.  But there was little humor in Michael Wilson's film, just attacks.  Instead of showing where Moore screwed up, it tried to use a variation of the same tactics Moore uses to unsuccessfully prove its point.  If the purpose of this film is to show that Michael Moore hates America, then it falls far short of its goal.  First of all, Michael Wilson's film offers nothing to contradict any of the allegations made by Michael Moore in his films and books.  He only attacks Michael Moore, but not what he has to say.  He did try using a statistic to refute the "Bowling for Columbine" movie, but he only mentioned the small part of the total study that seemed to support his claim.  Wilson stated that statistically, Canada (a country with strict gun laws) has twice as much crime per capita as the US.  What he fails to tell you is that most of this crime is property crime - stealing stuff.  I'm not worried about getting shot by a petty thief or hit by a stray bullet during a turf war between rival factions of vicious shoplifting gangs.  If you look at the entire study, you'll see that what Mr. Wilson did not mention was that even though Canada had more overall crime than the US, the US has SIX TIMES as much VIOLENT CRIME as Canada.  You know, the kind of crime someone often commits with a GUN.  So, if one researches the one "fact" Mr. Wilson did bring up in his film, you'll find that it only supports Michael Moore and "Bowling for Columbine".  He would have been better off using the ideas of "Freakonomics", which paint a slightly different, but very logical, picture of gun control.  Even when Michael Moore annoys me, he still entertains me.  The humor in his films is obvious.  Yes, he is frequently over the top with his attacks, his often-overbearing personality, but it's still funny.  You can always detect the twinkle in his eye.  Wilson just attacks; no real humor here.  Moore is like a big, friendly dog that wants to play, but knocks you down with his enthusiasm - annoying, but fun.  Wilson is more like a pit bull, going straight for the jugular with no mercy - scary and dangerous.  He tried to be funny a couple times, but fell short of the joke.  His film is just a mean-spirited attack on Michael Moore.  The people Wilson interviews all obviously hate Moore for being who he is.  They remind me of all the other Michael Moore haters who write books and articles about him.  There are attacks on his weight, attacks on his often-slovenly appearance, but no real proof that most of what he says is not the truth.  If you read Jamie Whyte's book "Crimes Against Logic" you'll understand why attacking the messenger does nothing to negate the message.  That, to me, is the problem with the many books and videos out there which attack Michael Moore's work - they attack the person not the content.  I read that Moore was very careful to not screw up any of the facts in "Fahrenheit 911" to avoid similar criticisms as he got for "Bowling for Columbine".  So, while the critics don't like Moore for being fat, pushy, and annoying, they cannot refute any of the claims made by him in his movies and books.  From that I would have to conclude that even though Moore's tactics are difficult to accept, what he is trying to say must be true.    If that is the case, then it is obvious that Michael Moore does not hate America.  He loves his country as much or more than anyone living here.  This becomes obvious by watching "Fahrenheit 911" - one of the most patriotic films I've seen recently.  He just doesn't want to see our country destroyed by the people with the guns and money, the people who are getting richer and richer while the middle class shrinks and the lower class swells.  It is those people he is attacking, not America.  People like Mr. Wilson either cannot see that or, for whatever reason, are turning a blind eye to this obvious change in our country.  We are ALL Americans, not just the rich CEOs.  We are all hoping to live the American dream.  They are trying to steal the American dream.  Michael Moore is just pointing this out. 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 Having never read a Koontz novel before I was looking forward to my first one. So I picked this up. Boy, what a disappointment. For 469 pages all I kept asking myself is what is going on? Why is this happening and what's the point of the entire book? In short, I felt the entire book was a big mess. Koontz co-wrote this book with someone else and it reads like it. It seems that these two guys were locked in separate rooms and wrote two different stories and never bothered to talk to one another while they were writing.  Characters pop up and storylines are laid out that lead to nowhere. One character, who happens to be autistic, can only walk while he completes imaginary crossword puzzles in his mind. Sounds interesting but his story has no plot or ending whatsoever. I have no idea how this characted is connected to the other characters in this book.  For almost the first 50% of this book deals with pieces of what I was hoping would be a much larger, more coherent puzzle. I was waiting for something to happen but it never did. If Frankenstein is still alive than only a few people were murdered and it seems no one actually cared except two cops. Hardly what I would call earth shaking considering who the killer(s) could be.   I think I'll pass on any further Koontz novels for now. I was never a big fiction fan but friends of mine talked me into testing the waters with Koontz, Patterson, Brown, etc. I think I'll go back to by non-fiction books for awhile and save this tripe for the beach 
 The Culture Cult is an ascerbic, sarcastic text that is more concerned with browbeating readers with its stringent defence of Western civilization than examining tribal cultures beyond mere stereotypes.  I originally picked up this book because I was interested in the results of the romanticisation of tribal cultures.  The tendency to romanticise tribal cultures as being closer to nature and more at one with nature has a long history especially among colonial settlers (though in their haste to be seen as higher animals, of course there was less romanticization and more condescending observation).  Often, this romanticization does not fit with the events of the past.  But, Sandall is no objective commentator, attempting to see similarities between civilization and tribal culture and temper romanticization of tribalism.  He is batting for civilization, denigrating tribal cultures as wasteful, ignorant, unaware and incapable of connecting with the environment in an ecologically sound way.  For example, his claim that Maori first wiped out the moa, then the seals before turning to cannibalism displays scant regard for New Zealand history in his desperation to prove that tribal cultures annihilated the environment as Western civiliztion has, does and will continue to do (pp. 122.) (Of course, Sandall is actually trying to prove that tribal cultures were worse than civilization)  The one fact in this example that Sandall manages to get right is that the moa were decimated by Maori.  Not so the seals.  European sealers arrived in New Zealand in their hundreds at the beginning of the 1800s  to join in the sealing trade with grave consequences for seal populations.  But, sealing stopped in the 1900s and the seal population is slowly recovering.  Go to Kaikoura and have a gawk, Roger!    The comment "After using up all the large birds and mammals, the polynesians now began to eat each other"(122) is fantastical.  Yes there was cannibalism BETWEEN tribes DURING or AS A RESULT OF warfare.  If Sandall wants to present cannibalism he has a duty to do just a smidge of research rather than merely extrapolate what he would like to believe.  New Zealand was not a nation before the signing of The Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 and a number of Maori tribes lived on the islands as individual tribes.  There were alliances between some tribes and often wars were fought over land and resouces.  Cannibalism occurred between tribes after wars in a ritualistic manner that has been documented in other tribes. Cannibalism did not occur because people were hungry ("predation by other hungry humans" according to Sandall), nor, as Sandall negligently suggests, did they eat their "own".   There are many factual inaccuracies throughout this book.  Sandall depicts tribal cultures as barbaric and less evolved than civilization which I am sure he, and many of his readers, find very soothing but this adds little to modern debates.  This book is a bitter diatribe for people who want to believe in the superiority of Western civilization. Polarising tribal culture and civilization just fuels exaggerated stereotypes and offers no real solutions to how countries with indigenous populations who predated, and were taken advantage of and abused by, colonial settlements (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America....) are to move forward into the future together.    
 i am a huge dre fan but this didn't do it. tracks 3 and 12 are pretty good but other than that i didn't enjoy it. peep some of his other albums though 
 I was disappointed in this CD.  The choice of songs is okay, but his voice leaves a little to be desired.  Not something I would recommend to true Smokey Robinson/Miracles fans.  Some of the songs are almost painful to listen to.  I am sorry I wasted my money. 
 I read this book because it was supposed to be one of Heinlein's classics.  I liked several of Heinlein's early works and thought I'd try this one, although I heard it was controversial.  After reading it, I can see why.  I cannot recommend this book.  It is not a classic, and if it wasn't written by Heinlein it probably wouldn't have been published, and if it was published, would have been forgotten long ago.  Other reviewers state that this is a book that questions social customs.  I'm sorry, but stories about time travel in which the protagonist meets and beds his mother as a young woman are not questioning social norms, they are the rantings of a dirty old man.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' this is not.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long are entertaining, but they don't make up for the poor quality of the rest of the text.  I regret spending money on this book, and I really regret losing the time I wasted reading it.  7MAY06 - I've added to this review after receiving a few not helpful votes, because, in part, I was concerned that my original review was too terse.  My opinion about this novel has not changed.  This is a series of stories about the life and adventures of Lazarus Long, a man who has lived thousands of years and experienced, effectively, multiple lives.  That is, he has loved, married, and 'built a life' several times.  He has now grown weary of the tedium of life and is contemplating suicide.  The novel consists of dialogue with some of his living decendants as he tells the story of his life.  Stories, really.  Each major section in the book is a vignette in LLs life.  In theory, this was a very good idea for a sci-fi novel, but in practice, this novel is simply tripe.  There are several things that I really dislike about this novel and would not recommend it to anyone.  Like much of Heinlein's later writings, this novel explores alternate family relationship (i.e. a code for incest).  As I mentioned above, one of the vignettes involves LL travelling back in time to bed his mother.  Another relates a `complex' (i.e. sexual) relationship between brother and sister.  Additionally, most of the novel is dialogue between the characters, there isn't much action.  I generally view this as a strength, not a weakness, but in this case the dialogue can be classified only as mindless banter loaded with sexual inuendo and overtone.  The characters on Beverly Hills 90210 had better lines.  If you are looking for a good science fiction novel, this is NOT IT.  This is really a novel about alternate family relationships with some sci-fi elements (e.g. longevity and time travel) in the plot.  There are some who may find this type of novel compelling, but from my perspective, the author of `Starship Troopers' and `The Puppet Masters' fell a long way when he published this novel.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long, a collection of witty saying interspersed throughout the book are great.  Judging from the other reviews, there are many who find this novel appealling.  Just be warned that this novel is very different than Heinlein's earlier classics.  There may be Time Enough for Love, but most people don't have enough time in their life to waste on this silliness 
 I went into this movie not expecting anything special. I had read the reviews and got a mixed feeling. I decided to go for it... I wish I hadn't. I couldn't even finish watching the movie it was so bad. Characters popping out of nowhere and having no purpose. Almost each and every scene could be given an award as worst scene in any movie if that award was given. I had read that some of the scenes were beautiful. All right, I suppose, the scenery perhaps... but the acting was awful. Even if I like an actor I try not to be bias and Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek are not bad actors, if I remember correctly. This was laughable. Sutherland's role had no purpose. It was well acted, but it meant nothing.  The story didn't work; it just didn't flow well. I felt almost... tipped while watching it because everything was off. No one is seriously offended and then swoons over the one who did the offending; not in a matter of a few seconds anyway. The story moved so fast and was so crooked that I called it quits before I squirmed through anymore of the Razzie worthy scenes 
 Oh my gosh,this book was a pain.The first 200 pages were ok but after that,the story loses heat and dragged on without a plot.The writing was mediocre and lazy as if he were in a rush to finish this book.Also,Banks was a very unlikeable character.He was lusting after Pamela when he was already married,he got into a fight in a pub and he came across as a very unsentimental man.Other than that,the detectives in this book,other than Susan,were just plain barbaric.They acted like criminals instead of detectives.And the part about the "shaved pussies"was totally disgusting.All in all,the book was a pain to read.The contrived plot,mediocre writing plus all the unlikeable characters just make this a very bad book 
 I bought this book a week ago and spent one and half hour for quick overview.  I'm studying intermediate Calculus with linear algebra. Well, my impression was it's very difficult to read. There are very few examples with solution, all the context written without diagrams.  
 The Tenant is a film that wastes time and loses viewers.  Long stretches of time where nothing happens, something quickly happens, then we are back to the monotonous pace - excruciating to watch.  Never have I checked and checked to see how much of a film was left.    The story sounds really good and gripping - tenant moves into the apartment of a woman who committed suicide.  He feels something is going on with the building, the manager, and the other tenants.  Slowly, he begins to identify with the dead girl.  But the pace is so slow.  The main character, played by Roman Polanski, is so boring and unsympathetic that you wish he would just jump out of the window and get it over with.  He has a beautiful girl interested in him - why?    The end - which I won't reveal - is absurd instead of unsettling, mainly because of the duration of time it took to get to that point 
 Well, I am not financed by any right wing think tank (but if there's a think tank out there that wants to finance me--right or left--, give me a call!), but forty years ago Ehrlich was predicting massive global starvation in the 1990's.  Well, I went throught the 90's and I don't really recall that.  If you're looking for a scary but fictional story, read Steven King...or Paul Ehrlich I guess.  But let's not pretend that this has anything to do with reality.  
 If I had the choice I would rate it 0 stars. The video talks to people like children and treats the viewer as if they've had no human contact in their life 
 I'm surprised that such a shallow, heavy-handed book was considered publishable.  From the start, the book pounds the reader with the main character's "double life" without a trace of grace or subtilty.  It reads like "young adult" fiction, except that it doesn't have any likable characters.  The one interesting result of reading this book is to see how such a potentially interesting topic like bigamy can be so boring when addressed by an incompetent writer 
 This book was a total disappointment. The information provided was very basic and contained information most people should already be aware of.  I would have returned the book had the price not been so low.  I imagine the author simply sat down one afternoon, for an hour, and wrote it when he nothing else to do.  I read it in less time and threw it in the trash.  
 This movie has no plot. It rips off the books This movie wouldn't be popular if Raven  wasn't in it. They think everything is a big deal and Galleria is really stupid. Read the books and don't bother with this annoying movie 
 Comparing Oceans 11 of the 1960s to the remakes of today is like comparing the Vegas casinos of yesteryear and today.  The hippest casinos of that era were, by today's highest standards of casino elegance and class (no, I'm not talking about Excalibur), dull, smokey, hokey, and cramped - just like the original Oceans 11.  I'm as fascinated with the Rat Pack as much as anyone, but I think it's important to take the rose colored glasses off when critiquing the work of these sometimes neurotically insecure and deeply flawed individuals in order to judge a movie on its own merits.  I think too many peoples' sense of self identity is reflected in the image of the Rat Pack to ever really do objectivity justice.  Humor and style do evolve (my father, for example, finds no humor in some of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV today), so it's hard to compare two different eras.  Nevertheless, great, timeless cinema came out of this era, but this work is not in that category.  By any movie standards it drags heavily and its "hipness" seems contrived and forced into an otherwise hokey vibe. The musical interludes and final stride down the Strip are incredible for reinforcing this image (and I do love them as stand alone moments), but jar so completely with the tone and style of the rest of the movie that I can't help but think this was just a vanity flick to satiate the appetites of fans hungry to devour media images of the highest style and pizzaz that era had to offer.  Regarding the issue of whether this movie appeals only to an older generation, it should be noted that those in the younger generation who have reviewed this movie favorably are teenagers.  There may be something deeper at work here - an adolscent (or arrested adolesecent) quest for a two-dimensional, this-is-what-cool is mantra by fans of any age.  To me this movie is little more than a vain time capsule revealing how much tighter, interesting, and more sophisticated not only most movies but perhaps society at large has become.  That said, there's still an audience for the old school casino in which dank slot machines greet you at the door on the way to the cheap buffets, just as there is and always will be an audience that smugly holds this 1960s Ocean 11 as superior.  I know I'll take a hit in terms of "was this review helpful" points from this crowd, but by the nature of who they are they got away with a lot that would never compel an objective viewer free from the folklore enmeshed in this intriguing group's fame.  
 Ive read reviews for this piece of schlock calling it a "  cult classic" ( isnt that  what they always call crappy movies that only stoned college kids can watch? )  or "underated" (theres a reason  it was underated -IT SUCKS). Brad Pitts performance was laughable. Watch any episode of Gunsmoke and tell me Early Grace wasnt a bad impersonation of Festus from start to finish. And that guy from the X Files ,David sumthin or other, mumbles in this annoying monotone throughout the whole film. This guy adds about as much to the movie as those ads for the concession stand.And Juliet Lewis playing a  yet another brain dead bimbo. Who woulda saw THAT one coming??? The only reason I gave this one 2 stars is its so bad it just kept me on the edge of my seat. I think its called " morbid fascination", like when you stop to gawk at a really bad traffic accident - it repulses you but you just cant turn away. If you want my advice ( and you probably dont) take the money you were gonna spend on this movie and go buy a Gunsmoke DVD. That way you get Festus AND you get to watch Matt Dillon beat the h*** outta somebody 
 This book was written in 1982, updated in 1995. It has a whole section on cameras, which isn't useful since most of them are outdated. Doesn't even mention digital cameras. Since it specifically discusses the mechanics of cameras, I found this book to be disappointing. 
 Maybe I should read the description better, but I was disapointed to find out, when receiving it, that this is JUST a USB Key with a pen and anemic led light.  No "swiss army stuff". Not even a knife. I thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have, you know, a knife?   That said, the USB key is very tiny, almost too small on its own (detached from the swiss army non-knife housing), so it's good it has a "home" within the casing, otherwise it would probably go missing 
 I was quite disappointed to find this "book"--pamphlet-sized, large fonts spreading out over sixty plus pages, roughly a paragraph per page--living up to its title. It is really no more than a glorified lecture from an established philosopher who, it would seem, has become big enough to pull a con job on his readers. In the end, Frankfurt takes all this time to reach the conclusion that BS is different from lying, in my opinion hardly worth the paper it's printed on. All in all, an inconsequential and not very entertaining analytical exercise by an emeritus academic with too much time on his hands. If you want to read a work that lives up to being called "entertaining" and "enlightening" you could try "From Lowbrow to Nobrow" (2006).     
 This is something for a new manager with little experience in not only systems administration but supervision.  This book may give a clue to someone who has just stepped into such a position but provides little depth and direction.  Unfortunately, there isn't any one book out there as management is a very complex role that encompasses many disciplines, any one of which would be a volume in itself.  I was very dissappointed and I find the other reviews misleading 
 When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem. 
 This book, this so called scientific social book, is a tower constructed by lies and half truths based upon the author's (and the liberal media's) hatred toward Christians.  There is no such thing as a war against science by Republicans and the Christians.  There IS such a thing as a war against God, very easily  seen in such "I hate Christians" books like this one, but that is to be considered later on.  Basically, this book is a 342 page book founded upon Christianphobia.  It is a witch hunter's book that tries to demean and belittle and lie about Christians.  I will make this brief, but specific on two examples.  1) Darwinism and 2) Abortion and Stem-Cell Research.    Why do I feel the need to stand up against the idea of teaching children about Evolution?  Why do I want to stand up against the humanistic agenda of destroying the minds and souls of our children?  Why do I feel the need to push for the consideration of Intelligent Design to be offered toward these same children?  Because evolution is false.  Evolution is not true.  Evolution holds no solid ground.  Have I studied evolution?  Yes.  Before becoming a Christian I was an outspoken apostle of Evolution until I was shown the facts and the facts are this...evolution is a fallacy and the only reason why Evolution is being so championed in the class rooms is because the humanist/liberal hate Christians.  They call us anti-intellectuals, strangely enough, and  yet the driving force of the liberal party is a paranoid dilution driven hatred toward Christians.  Here are some authors and their titles that I challenge you with:  Ralph Muncaster's Dismantling Evolution; Phillip Johnson's Darwin on Trial; David Snoke's A Biblical Case for an Old Earth; and finally, Fazale Rana and Hugh Ross' Who was Adam.    Then there is abortion.  What is so scientific about abortion?  You kill a child.  Simple.  Why should the scientific community care so much about abortion?  Because they do not understand the concept of human rights (their human rights are rights that go along with whatever the PC pop culture has to say this week).  Stem-Cell research is a tag along on the abortion supporting train because these so called scientists want you the reader to think that if the two do not go together then all these people will die a painful death if Stem-Cell research is not provided.  Abortion in itself is murder.  Simple as that.  You murder a child.  A child with a mind, a child with a heart, and a child with a soul.  That is not emotional blackmail toward women, that is just the simple truth.  And Stem-Cell research?  You do not have to harvest embryos like some scientist and politician out of Brave New World.  There are far better ways, far safer way, to study Stem-Cell and how it may or may not help those who are in need.  I suggest you read works such as ProLife Answers to ProChoice Arguments by Randy Alcorn    There is no Republican war against science.  There are many scientists like David Snoke and Hugh Ross that stand up and support the truth that comes, from the very heart of the matter, from the Bible.  Republicans and Christians do not long for some "Dark Age" of society.  They, we, I, want the truth to be shown in society away from the liberal bewitching Christianphobic fanaticism that comes from those like Sam Harris and Chris Mooney 
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 What a joke! I baught it for my girlfriend and just got it today by UPS. When I opened the box, I found there is a huge crack on the sole. Also there is a scratch on the leather. The workmanship is not so good too. I'm going to return it. Still not sure if I have to pay the shipment by myself. 
 Only about 25% of the miniatures were pictured which makes it very hard to choose and bake them. I was dissappointed at the lack of illustration 
 Despite the hyperbolic praise on the back cover--best war novel of the twentieth century!!!--I found this Ballard offering so tedious and unpleasant that I gave up on it just thirty or so pages before the end. My main problem was with Jim; he's basically the only character and he's so unlikable that after a while you just don't feel like spending any more time with him. In Jim you also see the germ of the fascist leanings so evident in the main characters of the truly execrable--but at least readable--Ballard novels __Cocaine Nights__ and __Super-Cannes__.  In my opinion, if you want to read the semi-autobiographical adventures of a boy in an occupied country, you're better off with __The Painted Bird__. If you prefer books about life in prison camps, try __If This Is a Man__ or __The Truce__ by Primo Levi. You'll find in his books the humanity so glaringly absent in Ballard's 
 This switch works really well.  I use it between a Windows XP and Windows 98 operating systems.  When switching to Windows 98, control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly.  However, when switching to the XP OS, control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds.  I also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one USB port on the PC.  It frees up a port.  Using the Numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch.  It also has buttons on the device itself to select which PC to control.   I rate this product 5 stars.  When I posted the first time, I thought I put 5 stars; but I must have accidentally selected 2.  I recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price 
 While I enjoyed reading some aspects of this book, it is organized in a helter-skelter fashion. The author jumps from subject to subject without any seeming connectedness. Maestro Eger's musical passion is obvious, nevertheless, and his interest in quantum physics is real enough. I did not think, however, that his arguments of the interrelatedness of music and physics were developed in a concrete fashion. Dana Zohar's "The Quantum Society" is much better reading for people interested in connecting the new physics with our individual and societal functions.   While the author's politics were never completely explained to the reader, it is quite obvious that he leans towards a progressive or even socialistic philosophy. Yes, there are virtual relationships in music, physics, and math. I doubt, however, that the same is true for the author's liberal outlook on society with respect to these other subjects. In my opinion, his poorly written attempts to link music, physics, and math with his social philosophy failed completely.   This book may well be enjoyable reading for some musicians. That said, I can't imagine anyone other than far left activists grasping at straws that would be interested in reading this volume.  
 I saw this in a theatre, and I was the only one who wasn't laughing hysterically.  There were a few chuckles here and there, but this film is actually quite boring.  There are long, dull stretches here between the gross out jokes, and the drama (for lack of a better word) is really tedious.  Of course, the attitude towards sex is extraordinarily childish (which is the point), and the film is extremely stupid.  In many ways, this film exemplifies what kind of films were popular in the 1990's; gross out films with idiotic characters and really stupid behaviour and situations.  I never found this film to be actually funny.  The Naked Gun type films can be quite dumb at times, yet they're funny.  This film has a few mild laughs, but mostly it's painfully unfunny.  On a plus, this film doesn't have the smugness a lot of 90's films had, but that doesn't make it much better.  So, if you're in the mood for stupid, stupid, and stupid, this film will do it for ya.  If not, stay away.    
 Although Petra has a sweet voice, I felt her songs sounded juvenile and scattered. 
 I hated this book.  This family has two girls, Racie and Jaynell.  Rachie is a girly-girl and Jaynell is a tomboy.  It seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  Her parents are just plain crazy.  Mama repedily whipped Racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to "tear up" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  Once Jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. Then Jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on Racie.  Her parents are just crazy.  Then grandpa dies.  Dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  I understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  Children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  Racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  Jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  These people were crazy.  This book is crazy 
 The game footage here is very good, except it is constantly interrupted, and has no continuity. Some of the interviews seem genuine, while others are obviously staged. The students and players act as if they were given the green light by the director to be as gross and obnoxious as possible. In that, they succeeded.  Entries at the Sundance Film Festival must be awful indeed for this film to be a Grand Prize nominee. The coaches stand around in the locker room, while the players take turns giving each other the cursing of their lives. I was rooting for the opposing team to give Massillon a beating every game.    I can't recommend this film to anyone. It doesn't teach about football, the language is awful. I don't feel I know anything about Ohio football that I didn't know before I saw the film. I hope the Tigers are not a typical team in Ohio.   For a real football film, I recommend "The Last Game" 
 This book is well and fine if you happen to live in the Appalacian mountains. Outside that region, however, it is useless. Mr. Elliots botanical knowledge seems to be geographicaly quite limited. The illustrations of the roots themselves are very good. But the pictures of the plants themselves are small and nondiscript. This leads the question of "How do I find the root if I can't find it's top?". I highly would recommend one of the Peterson guides before this book 
 This film is AWFUL! Once again Hollywood misuses the amazing talents of that "MOST BEAUTIFUL and SENSUAL" of actresses,GINA GERSHON.LOVED GINA but HATED the film/THe two-star rating was for GINA,she is ALWAYS GREAT 
 I hate this bra.  The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on.  Shoulder straps are skinny & inadequate.  Only good thing is that it is low-cut.  I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart.  I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut 
 I bought this book because my family lives near the beach. I thought our 17 mth son could relate to the theme.  We were disappointed with this book:  watercolors too light and hard to see and too few pages even for young child. The book did not keep son's interest and he loves to flip thru books and have you read to him. My recommendation: Find another book. 
 Like most indie gay themed movies, "Trick" had quite a bit of buzz around it. A terrific movie with Tori Spelling! How could I not love it?  I loved "Die Mommy, Die!", "Girls Will Be Girls", and "Jeffrey". So I gotta love this too, right? Right??  I found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality. A hot go-go boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb?    Uh... why??  So they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy.  And then it's one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans.  As much as I can't stand Tori Spelling's "acting", she's the only performer not phoning it in. (Maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots?)  What little life there is in this movie, it owes it to her.  The problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking.  The "sizzling" dancer looked like bored monkey. And the soft, sensitive Gabriel has no personality. Why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery.  I guess if go-go boy dropped the zero and found another guy (which wouldn't be too much of an effort for him), there wouldn't be much of a movie.  A cameo by Miss Coco Peru is a nice treat.  But she's lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish, you'd think she was in a different movie.  High expectations, very low gratification. Honestly, skip it 
 Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.  Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him   advice.  Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).  The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.  It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.  See the movie 
 Thanksgiving is a harvest festival; a time to show appreciation for all we have.  Teaching our children a biased viewpoint of the First Thanksgiving empowers racism to continue in this country.   Popular renditions of the First Thanksgiving (such as this book) give children the mistaken impression that the relationship between American Indians and English colonists was one of mutual help, respect and friendship.  This popular belief does not take into account the way in which the colonists persecuted the American Indians, sold them into slavery and drove them from their homes.  Not to mention the epidemic diseases colonists brought to America, genocide and erosion of tribal soverreignty.  Get to know American Indian history through their stories, captured by Gerald McDermott or other authors at another time of year rather than celebrating the dreadful. 
 i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness (<100%). just scheduled an exchange LCD 
 I ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up "big people food" for my grandson.  It could not even grind up a soft hot dog!  We kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material (painted gray to look like metal!) it just couldn't do the job.  Sheesh, I mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder.  Total waste of money.  Also, my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two.  Junk 
 Given this book was about presentation and promotion I was suprised to find the reproduction very poor, as if it was a photocopy in some parts.  The paper selection was poor and some of the photographs of works approaching unreadable.  The advice and text was good.  Very, very diasappointed and in fact gave the book away 
 If you have never written a successful grant before or are primarily involved in raising funds for social services this book will likely be of help.  However, for the rest of us it has little to offer. The book is narrowly focused on procedures one must follow before, during and after the grant writing process, but it fails to discuss writing strategies to enhance persuasiveness or improve the presentation of complicated technical subjects. I found it useless 
 Did not work with my Palm T|C right away. I've not used this for any other purpose. I expect either Palm or SD to release proper software to have it work with Palm T|C 
 This backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck, it would have been better with metal zipper 
 I found the formulas to be too exotic. Most of the ingredients  are very expensive. I was also dissapointed that natural preservatives were not discussed. The thought of someone keeping their lotion in the refrigerator is an inconvenience. I want to sell my concoctions, and that can't be done without preservatives 
 The first sentence in the book is "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I realized I could understand the way animals think."  It should have been "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I SOMEHOW GOT THE NOTON THAT I could understand the way animals think." There's no proof in this book, no good evidence, just Ms. Grandin's anecdotes and speculations.   Noticing a lot of detail because you have autism and being able to use this ability to design humane slaughterhouses does not translate into thinking like animals think.  The book does offer many clear, simple descriptions of scientists' research. So if you don't know anything about animal research, these descriptions could be a good place to start. 
 Not the Beachboys and definitely not Phychedelic. Sorry, but if I could have given this zero stars I would have. The Partridge Family are by far a more credible band 
 Hello to everyone who reads my review of this book. First of all for those of you who will need a TI-86 calculator which this book calls for, dont worry about because doesnt even tell you how to use it for certain applications such as Super Mesh, Method Analysis and so on. I had to go to a student who was in a College Algebra class to learn how to use this calculator for this book! Second my professor shows better examples on solve the problems in the book which the book makes it so confusing. You have to ask the professor to show several examples to learn what the book is covering. I would suggest to professors and the Director/Chairman as a student, look for a book that you can use in the class other than this where students can learn from and not become so confused over the material to where almost every student in the class has to ask the professor several questions about the topic and meet with him one on one. I am speaking for other students by the way. I am also helping the professors also. Get a book that students can learn from instead of a one on one discusssion with the professor. Some thing else other than this book! Thanks for your time reading my review. ~Scott 
 This could have been an excellent study into the characteristics of manhood set by culture, society, environment, and nature. Instead it is a terribly limited view of a handful of men in one country. Sadly, it is void of enthusiasm for its topic, boring as dirt, and less interesting than reading a phone book.The author seems more intent on proving he has read a great deal on the topic by endlessly paraphrasing the work of other studies (always giving due credit), but displays little skill in using his knowledge to make his viewpoints or research remotely appealing 
 A mysterious car accident claims two lives.  One man witnesses it.  Same man loves a woman who marries the driver (who was also in and survives the accident).  A priest is also in love with the woman.  Half way thru the  book, nothing else has happened.  3/4 of the way thru the book nothing else  has happened.  Once in awhile they talk about the mystery surrounding the  car crash.  The mystery to me is why I'm still reading this book.  It must  be because the style is enjoyable.  There sure isn't any plot.  Greeley's  style is definitely fun, but other than that I'm not sure what this book  has to offer.  Nice cover,tho 
 I purchased this movie because it said that those who purchased Love's Enduring Promise also purchased this movie.  Was I ever disappointed.  I was not prepared for the content of them sleeping together before being married.  I had purchased this for my 14 year old daughter.  She also was very disappointed.  I replaced her Christmas present with another, more appropriate movie and I am distroying this movie so that no one in my home will ever have the opportunity to view it again 
 I liked this book very much when I started reading it.  The authors' characterizations of sailing were right on the money.  The characters and plot start out interesting but it seems the book was rushed to a sloppy and confusing ending that left me dissatisfied and wanting more.  I kept waiting for somthing to tie things together, but it never happened 
 According to the Internet Movie DataBase this miniseries was originally filmed in 1.33:1, so that means that the signature edition is reduced from fullscreen to widescreen for modern theatre-style TVs.  That means a lot of the picture has been removed.  In my view this is a fatal flaw.  If you want the real version, get the older DVD set, as (in my opinion) this one doesn't have enough extras to recommend it even for people who own widescreen TVs.  UPDATE: Recently I purchased the Signature Edition of this miniseries as my old one was badly damaged.  So I had the opportunity to compare the two side-by-side.  I immediately put a sample of both the old and new DVD episodes.  Contrary to a later reviewer's assurances that this DVD set was filmed in 16/9 ratio, and that it was cropped for the original TV airing, I can now state with absolute certainty that that is not the case (or if it was, this edition has suffered a further cut, giving the viewer even less image - at least vertically - to watch).  The Signature Edition is definitely a cropped version, as it showed a distinct loss of image at the bottom of the screen in the clips that I chose to compare.  This does not apply to the titles, which have been re-done for this edition, and are an improvement for those of us with big screen TVs.  It may be that the miniseries was filmed in something like 1.66:1 as it may be the case that in the horizontal plane some image has been recovered, but if it was filmed in 16/9 (1.78:1) the Signature Edition does not reflect that.  Also, this DVD set has some very apparent visual flaws that are not evident in the original DVD release.  During the special effects sequences (during spaceflight etc.) there are often visible horizontal mismatches on the film.  These happen with almost every space sequence and are very distracting indeed because the eye is naturally drawn to the flaw.  To be completely fair there's no way I can tell whether this is a DVD flaw, or if it's due to the transfer from my DVD player to the TV - but it shouldn't be there and I don't experience this flaw with any of my other DVDs.  So my warning still stands.  This is not the definitive edition of this miniseries.  The original DVD release is the series as it was meant to be seen (uncropped vertically).  The Signature Edition shows less image and a poor quality image, and the visual artifacts make the spaceflight sequences virtually unwatchable, especially on a larger screen.  Needless to say, I returned this DVD set for a refund.  In my opinion it is sub-standard.  If this series was indeed filmed in 1.78:1 the definitive edition has yet to be seen on DVD.  I would like to see such an edition in the future - perhaps remastered and enhanced for 16:9 viewing and perhaps in a HDTV format so that it can really be appreciated on big screen TVs 
  I'm of a mixed mind about this book.  While it might be useful for somebody to build one or two of the easier projects with a bunch of hand power tools when bored on a Sunday, most of the designs are rather flimsy.  The book seems to be designed around making things out of a 5 piece power tool kit and cheap wood you can get at home depot.    What it does NOT do is teach you anything about Fine Woodworking.  It seems to attach everything together with screws, which is probably the least effective long term way to put a wood project together.  The entire subject of basic joinery is skipped, and it has you buying hardwoods like Oak even for painted projects where cheap pine would better serve your needs.  The subject of wood movement is almost completely ignored.  There are far better project-based books out there, if you want to learn about woodworking, and not screwing scrapwood together into some not-very-attractive furniture. 
 The book informs you of various sql commands, but fails to give you the general syntax.  If what you are trying to do has not been explicitely done in the book, it is unlikely to find what you are looking for in the book.  The book is truly a workbook, and nothing else, and should not be purchased as an oracle sql refrence book 
 I LOVED The Inferno, so I approached this book with the enthusiasm of a gourmand at an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Sadly, the bread turned out to be stale, the steak overdone and the desserts moldy. Okay. Now that I've run that metaphor into the ground, let's talk about Vita Nuova.  I found it to be pretty darn tedious and highly melodramatic.  The prose is self-indulgent and dry; the poetry, while slightly better, falls into the same camp.  You just want to say to the guy--get a life!  At several points during the book, Dante's fellow townspeople mock him because of his constant waterworks and woe-is-me-ing. I sympathized with them, found myself laughing at this whiny, timid little man.  Dante, as he portrays himself in this book, is a bore, a sniveling, spoiled child.  
 I am interested in making a customized RV, and have been finding books on what others have done. This book is a spoof of famous structures, drawn on wheels - and NOT a book on making Vardos, or custom campers and RVs. Not recommended. I returned it immediately 
 This book is just a clever rehash of his other books but just repackaged under "POWER AGING". Some of his books contain the title Gary Null Phd. and other books just say Gary Null- so this time it is "Phd"- the book jackets NEVER say from what University. Many of the supplements pluged in Null's book are sold by his company Gary Null Associates so it is hard not to look at this book as just another product placement. The idea that hundreds of  millions of people of diverse cultures should eat a specific way is ludicrous. Gary Null writes his book as if he has all the information, but scientists still do not have much of the answers regarding aging, yet Gary gives the impression he knows everything there need to know about health and mega- antioxidants may become pro-oxidants in the body. He sounds like the Jim Jones of health gurus. Gary Null knows that his diet is nearly impossible to follow for the normal average person working 8 to 6 pm 5 or 6 days a week and he creates products that fill the need. Instead of eating all those lbs. of organic vegetables and fruit each day just take his expensive concentrates and supplements and watch Gary Inc. get richer. CASE IN POINT: FOR OVER 30 YEARS GARY CLAIMED THAT CHOCOLATE WAS TOXIC AND AS BAD AS CONSUMING MEAT OR COFFEE-NOW HE SELLS A 'NUTRITIOUS" GARY NULL CHOCOLATE BAR!   
 I've read every piece of fiction that Pearl Cleage has written, and I have to say that I was disappointed with this book.  There were too many characters, and the plot took too long.  I made myself complete the book just to see how it ended.  The characters were too predictable and very transparent 
 The title of the book is completely misleading. Actually the book vacillates between a mechanic description of kabbalah tree, an interpretation of a painting, Jewish alphabet and various religious points of view. At the end, the reader is left with some information which by no means will lead him/her to an inner balance. This is a purely theoretic book and has nothing to do with spiritual growth 
 Read the recommendations on the cover carefully. They are ALL for the author, NOT the book. There are good reasons the book is not recommended. It is not based upon research or even extensive personal experience with addicts. It is simply some off the cuff remarks by a famous person who does not understand addiction. I agree spirituality is the cornerstone of recovery and joy is needed, but it is not as simple as the author implies. His emphasis on psychoanalytic understanding of addiction is very outdated and has not led effective treatment 
 You have this camera case listed under accessories for the Panasonic DMC FA20PP Lumix Camera. The camera does not come close to fitting in this case. The camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case. 
 This book is great for those who are managers and won't ever actually do any real programming/web mastering or do anything but just want to know how IIS operates, or just want to claim you read a book on IIS.  If you are a webmaster or want to learn about IIS specifics, you've come to the wrong place, this book is not for you.    If you are looking for a how to guide, this book is painfully underdeveloped.  The authors are great for saying, if you want more information, use the IIS help and not discuss anything in great details.  Most of the book mentions different aspects of the IIS without really delving into the details of the options.  Parts on setting up mutliple websites is limited to 2 pages without telling you how to specifically do it.  Instead they mention the various options and pros and cons for the different options.  Beyond this, they say absolutely nothing.  This is a fantastic no help book and is one of the worst books written from Microsoft press.  Very disappointing 
 The book never arrived--Instead I was sent (3 months later) a small paperback entitled "Helping Children Accept Themseves and Others" from Better World Books.  Perhaps Adam Smith would agree that this is the market at work but in the future "Better World Books" will not be my market 
 I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc.  That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO?  Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory .. 
 A CROSS WITHOUT HELL IS A CONTRADICTION: READ THE APOSTLE'S CREED.  I fully agree with the UNPOPULAR reviewer "Andy Grey" who gave it one star.  It is impossible for annihilationist to comprehend sin and the law of God both of which are linked to the doctrine of hell.  They annihlate the law and sin with hell.  The endorsers deny Anselms teaching of the infintie debt and Why God Became Man.  Instead buy the book "Eternal Christianity" by Jim Cronfel to read all of the quotes from this book if the denials of sin and the law and the atonement and justification.   PATRIPASSIANISM IN THIS BOOK:  "There is no question now of the Father inflicting punishment on the Son or of the Son intervening on our behalf with the Father, for it is the Father himself who takes the initiative in his love, bears the penalty of sin himself, and so dies." p 152  DENIAL OF ETERNAL SIN BEARING:  "God in Christ bore our sins and died our death because of his love and justice, we must not think of it as expressing eternal sin-bearing in the heart of God. What Scripture does give us warrant to say, however, is that God's eternal holy love, which was uniquely exhibited in the sacrifice on the cross, continues to suffer with us in every situation in which it is called forth." p 329 - 330   DENIAL OF PARDON BY ATONEMENT:  "Nor, as we have seen, has Christ by his sacrifice prevailed upon God to pardon us." p 173  SEE THE PATTERN DEVELOPING?  Andy Grey is currently running 3 for 44 helpful votes.  Goes to show that the truth is sparce and the path is narrow.  I ask: do the "unhelpful" voters deny sin themselves? are they saved? or are they in it for popularity 
 Picked up this book from the library. My first book from John Varley. It is definitely a very strange book.  Spoilers ahead.   Very nice premise. Mammoth is discovered frozen in the tundra - OK, believable. Couple of dead humans next to it, OK. Wait, one of them is wearing a wristwatch, wow! Wait, there's more, a time machine is there too. Then the next few chapters tell you how the machine is studied in the hope that they can make it work, and wham suddenly they make it work, and they come back with mammoths! Wow!   And you expect the next chapters to be about how they utilize the time machine, maybe to try and see how it works etc., or where they go...... But BAM, the entire middle of the books is worthless. It talks about how the wonderful baby mammoth captures the hearts of people who see it in the circus, how neat the circus is, kidnapping and interrogation of the protagonist, etc. In fact, the author fails to exploit the story and talks about...... a circus! What drivel. I just skipped over the entire middle of the book. It's not sci-fi at all, and totally boring. I don't want to read about a circus, even one with a mammoth in it.  Well, the author redeems himself in the last 10 pages with a surprise ending. But I finished the book in a very short time because I simply skipped over the boring non sci-fi stuff. I've never read John Varley before, but I just don't understand his writing. He must be a very bad author, or maybe he forgot that he was writing sci-fi book until his publisher reminded him at the end.   Just a very strange book for me, good start, good ending, 1/2 a book of nonsense in the middle. But I will try another of his books 
 I could not figure out from this book how to convert mp3 files to wav files in spite of what it says on page 170 
 There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. "Songs of Judy Garland" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what "look" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of "makeover". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to "Liza Minnelli" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't 
 Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.  As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating 
 We took a chance on these for part of a Father's Day gift and the piece of metal that acts as a spring broke after only 1 use. After reading the reviews I called the company instead of returning for a refund. They were very nice and sent out another one. This one just broke - exactly like the other one - after about a month of use. The overall design of the tongs is great like other Raichlen products but the construction is severely lacking. Don't waste your money on this model. 
 Regrettably one of the more unreadable tomes about Wall Street, "Every Man A Speculator" comes up as dry as a professor's rambling essay, as unyielding as a sermon, but with relevance much harder to discern.  The book is laden with--one might say overly reliant upon--quotes and convoluted, often pedantic sentence structures.  It is admittedly informative at turns, at times socially insightful, but with no joy in its reading.  It compels as a reference manual would, but that's not why we read. 
 While this book does dispel the image of Bob Hoffman as some sort of saint not to mention the fact that Fair dispels the notion that Hoffman was a strongman or superhealthy. In reality, Hoffman used aluminium weights for his "strongman exhibitions" and was quite unhealthy. And he was no saint.  Hoffmans main source of income was from his Oil Burner business. He saw weightlifting as a business opportunity and his primary interest was olympic weightlifting with bodybuilding as a sidethought.  Indeed, Hoffman found that by promoting bodybuilding events along with olympic weightlifting he could increase the attendance at the ole so boring olympic weightlifting contests.  Hoffman also saw an opportunity to sell weights, vitamins, protein powders and other supplements via weightlifting contests and his magazine Strength & Health which in fact was nothing more than a catalogue promoting his products.   Through the efforts of Hoffman, the AAU Mr. America was more or less a "who is the best built York BBC Man of the year." Poor Dan lurie would  win every subdivision and place second repeatedly during the early 40's and had to wonder when York would run out of employees that he had to be second to.  In 1947 Steve Stanko, a York employee would win the AAU/FIHC Mr. Universe contest in Phildelphia. In all fairness, this being the time when legends like Clancy Ross, Steve Reeves, George Eiferman, Lud Shusterick, Andre Drapp and Oscar Heidenstam not to mention York Barbells very own John Carl Grimek walked the earth, Steve Stanko Mr. Universe? C'mon!  The problems with Hoffman controlling the AAU bodybuilding movement continued through the 40's, 50's, 60's and even the 70's. Black and Puertican bodybuilders had no chance to win the coveted AAU Mr. America title and would frequently place lower than what they deserved in lower level contests as well. As a result, many of the top names just left the sport in disgust. The IFBB tried to launch in America but met with incredible opposition from Hoffman. It would be a decade later untill the IFBB would make a major impact on bodybuilding and give bodybuilders a fair alternative.   For years Hoffman was concerned about the popularity of bodybuilding and felt that too many in the Iron Game were focusing on the muscle contests in lieu of his precious olympic lifting. For the same reason, Hoffman tried to hold back powerlifting, initially referring to the sport as "Odd Lifting." I guess it was "odd" to Hoffman. The first National Powerlifting Championships were held in 1965 in York, Pa. and were incredibly successful. Hoffman even launched a new magazine called "Muscular Development" which would cover both bodybuilding and powerlifting while Strength & Health, Hoffmans flagship magazine (catalogue) would cover mostly olympic weightlifting with some health articles which were really intended to sell Hoffmans products. Sort of like an early version of informercials.   To Hoffmans dismay, powerlifting grew tremendously. Participants found that powerlifting was far easier on the body and joints that heavy squat cleans, split cleans, overhead presses, snatches and clean and jerks. Powerlifting also drew larger audiences than olympic lifting and once again Hoffman was concerned about taking away from olymic weightlifting. When it was discovered that England, Australia, Germany, Canada and many other countries had powerlifting advocates, powerlifters were after the AAU to organize a World Championships. But alas, Hoffman via the AAU claimed it could not be done.  In 1970, George Frenn who was an associate editor for Weiders magazine Muscle Builder/Power beseiged Joe Weider to organize a international powerlifting competition and Mr. Weider did. It was held along with the IFBB Mr. Western America in Los Angeles and was incredibly successful. This was despite attempts by the York group to stop the contest. According to the York magazines, "any AAU registered athlete who competes in this competition will be banned for life by the AAU." Reality was that York was just blowing smoke. The competition was extremely successfu. So successful that now Hoffman saw the possibilities (via competition with Joe Weider??) to organize the first World Powerlifting Championships in York, Pa. in 1971. Interesting how the impossible became possible. It was most obvious that the only reason that Hoffman organized the first World Powerlifting Championships was in fact to even the score with Joe Weider...but the good news is what came out of it....powerlifting surged in popularity, formed their own federation leaving the AAU which as far as most people were concerned, stood for Amateur Archiac Union, at least as far as the Iron Game was concerned.  Also during the 1970's, the IFBB gained acceptance with the General Assembly of General Sports Assembly giving the IFBB superiority over the AAU and establishing the IFBB as the official governing body for the sport of bodybuilding! Slowly, bodybulders in the USA began to switch over from the AAU to the IFBB and bodybuilders finally had a viable alternative. Today, the AAU no longer sanctions bodybuilding contests. The NPC, the american affiliate to the IFBB squelched the AAU and bodybuilders are far better off as result.  Strength & Health went the way of the stagecoach. Muscular Development was bought by Twin Labs. York Barbell still sells weights but you won't find York Barbell running any national level bodybuilding or powerlifting competitions anymore or even local events.   Getting back to my initial question, what exactly did Bobby Hoffman do for the Iron Game? I guess the best thing he did was plant the seeds for better promoters to take the sport where Hoffman couldn't or wouldn't. Bodybuilding shows are now held in large convention centers ins tead of YMCA's and High School Auditoriums and professional contests resemble rock concerts with special effects and large audiences. Olympic lifting and power lifting are both in better hands now as well.  Protein products now actually have protein rather than white sugar and white flour, the two main ingredients in Hoffmans products.   The other thing that Hoffman did was to infuriate members of the Iron Game to take the ball from Hoffman and run with it. To make The Iron Game the great sport that it is today. Hoffman may have initiated some of the things that we love about the sport today, but in fact, The Iron Game is far better off without Hoffman and York Barbell than it ever was with the York gang.  One other thing. In the early 60's, York Barbell were the first to exploit anabolic steriod use. A certain Dr. Zeigler administered them to York Olympic lifters in an attempt to compete on a world level in Olympic Weigthlifting. Soon steriod use exploded to bodybuilders and weightlifters were taking steriods like they use to take vitamin supplements and eating them like candy. Interesting too that even without steriods, the Japanese, Russians and the Germans still stayed ahead of our Drug Taking Americans! If it wasn't for York Barbell and Bob Hoffman perhaps steriod use would not be so prevelent today.  Gee--thanks Bob!  
 This is the last and final time I will be reviewing this movie.  The movie begins as Izzy Daniels, a boxer, is dancing in the streets. (Can we some Lionel Richie in the background?) He comes across Mary and her friends double-dutching where he says that it looks pretty easy, and all that jazz.  He watches them at a competition, and realizes it looks like fun, so he joins there team, but Mary is hesitant to let him join. Finally, he joins.  But doesn't tell his father. Ah, yes, the plot thickens.  Overall, an "okay" movie, but not worth buying if you ask me. It's pretty much like every other Disney Channel movie out there. Person is good at one thing, then does something to disappoint someone else, big happy ending.  Personally, the music was just okay. But everybody wants to be a singer. I mean, Keke Palmer needs to STEP AWAY from the microphone.  Corbin does his best at producing an upbeat track, "Push It To The Limit", and ends up making a fairly-decent song, but not great.  Worth watching on Disney Channel when they play it, if you can spare an hour and a half. 
 As far as crime dramas go, this is firmly mediocre.  The story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically, but the author's writing style is sometimes a distraction.  Why do the African-American suspects always ask for Slice soda to drink?  And they repeatedly make a point of asking for Slice.  (Do they even make it anymore?  I thought it was replaced by Sierra Mist).   And another distracting detail is the author's way of giving so many people nicknames.  You don't need to tell me that a guy's name is Ed "Smiley" Jones if you never mention "Smiley" again or there's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname.  That said, I liked the use of DC as the backdrop and if I was going on a plane ride, I would probably pick up another book by Pelecanos (but I wouldn't let anyone see what I was reading and then I'd leave it in the seatback when I deplaned) 
 This is a terrible book, because it is written in absolutely no context whatsoever.  It is basically the worst, most hateful things that Muslims have written compiled into a book and presented to the West as Islam.  Judging from his introduction, it is clear that the editor (Parfrey) has a vendetta against Islam and he is trying to scare the West about Islam.  An analogy would be if somebody gathers up all the hateful Neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic literature in  America and presents it to the East as "America".  The author fails to mention that the views espoused in Extreme Islam are supported by a very small percentage of Muslims and there is a great movement in many Middle Eastern countries (especially Iran) against "fundamentalism".  Secondly, Parfery takes absolutely legitimate writings about the Palestinian resistance and tries to present them as "extreme", thus trying to lump in the hateful writings of Khomeini with the moderate Arabs who want peace in Palestine.   Disgusting 
 Man, were we diappointed with this GE phone! We did everything right---"trained" the battery in the beginning, made sure we routinely charged it, never dropped or abused this phone, and then one day it started not holding a charge. We couldn't figure it out. It worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out, just like the other reviewers have said. We had a 10-year old Toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it's unfortunate demise, which is when we acquired this loser. Are there any good phones out there somewhere??? 
 Yogananda's message is potentially world changing.  However, I got more out of the Autobiography of a Yogi published by Self-Realization Fellowship because it was full of added footnotes which I found just as important and meaningful as the text.  Many explaining the essential oneness of western and eastern religions through biblical passages, etc 
 Very useless pants.  I bought them and tried them on my toddler twins and they did not work at all on a boy or girl and I did buy the correct size.  They even leaked when used over diapers at night.  They bascially do nothing 
 if your a retard, or just a geek to the hard core then you might like this junk. if your looking to go over the edge, then listen to this. this music would drive you crazy, only a idiot would like this junk. they have no concept of what they want to be, and every attempt to change it, up sounds like poor attempt. just wait for this one to be in the bargain bin if it isnt already. 
 This is not a how to book. This is a picture book. The author is a consumate artist, no doubt about that, but the publishers have marketed it in such a way as to suggest that you...the reader...will learn how it can be done. Not true. The author merely shows countless numbers of his own work. This leaves you to guess how it can be done. If you are a fan of the authors work then add this to your collection. If you want a book on how to render lighting effects in your own work then pass this book bye 
 This is when of those albums where about halfway through each song you say "when is this gonna get going?" and none of them ever do.  It's like slow-motion bland-pop 
 Don't waste your time.  10 books that could really be done in two.  Each volume is worse than the previous.  This guy is just trying to fill pages so sell more books, page after page of mindless babble with now value to the story line or even realted to the story line.  I'm actually goi9ng to throw these int he trash since I've finished them (I finish ewvery serties I start.)  I don't want anyone to have to go through having to read this stuff.  The unfortunate thing is that it is a good story line.  IF money grubbing did not get in the way he coul dhave done ti in three or four.  IF you're curious try the first one and take my word the next 9 are just more descriptions of the clothing.  
 One feels silly writing such a poor review on the work of someone with a resume like Nicholson, but it's hard to find much positive to say about the Society of Others, the first adult novel written by someone known for his screenplays, stage plays, and young adult.   Though perhaps that's the problem, for Society reads very much like a screenplay or young adult novel, despite being otherwise intended.   The book's unnamed protagonist is a sullen, cynical young man, recently graduated from college who sits in his room all day and tries to ignore the world, whether it come in the form of his family, his girlfriend, or his economic future.  The first quarter of the book introduces the character, puts him through his "world-weary" paces, and then has him use the thousand pounds gift from his writer father to "get away from it all" by hitching a ride with a trucker to an unknown destination.   The problems begin almost immediately.  Though he is supposed to have graduated from college, in his speech, his sullen tone, and his cliched version of cynicism, the narrator sounds much more like a 13 year old boy brooding in his room than a 21 or 22-yr-old.  His character is way over the top and while  he occasionally hits some perceptive notes, they're surrounded by so much cliched and over-the-top noise that the few good notes get drowned out.  And none of the dialogue in this section, mostly between the narrator and his family or his girlfriend, sounds like authentic speech.  One can argue that Society has a "fable" feel to it, so perhaps it isn't intended to, but the thing about most fables is they're short; it's hard to pull off the style and tone over long periods of time--it just gets too wearying on the reader.  In either case, the first 40-50 pages are a struggle to get through.  The trucker whose hobby is philosophy and manages to sum up then skewer most philosophers in a single conversation can be seen as part of the fable mode or as highly contrived; in either case it didn't work for me.    The middle section of the book picks up when the trucker is let into a country that has the look and feel of the old Eastern Europe police states.  Turns out the trucker is smuggling copies of an illegal book into the country. When he is discovered and violence occurs, the narrator manages to escape, left on his own in an unfamiliar, unknown country whose language he does not speak.    The narrator then hooks up with a violent resistance movement, a non-violent poetry-loving resistance, a simple peasant couple trying to get  by while caught between the state police and the terrorists, the state police, an absurdist television talk show host, a strange cello-playing monk with a secret identity, and a man in a grey Mercedes whom the narrator is sure has been hunting him.  While the pace and sense of tension, suspense all pick up in this section, it's marred by some hard-to-believe scenes, some triteness (the peasant couple for instance), and the sense that the characters we meet are just props rather than characters. Again, one has the sense of fable here with the simplistic viewpoints, the shallow characters, the sense-of-disbelief, but it's far too extended and just doesn't seem to work.    The end focuses on his attempts to disentangle himself from the politics he's become enmeshed in and to escape the country, as he realizes that all his earlier cynicism was horribly wrong:  his country, his family, his life wasn't so bad; his family loved him and he didn't do enough to return that love; life is for living; and other nice but trite sentiments.  The end itself returns to fable form.     The whole book reads much more like a young adult novel (not a particularly good one) in its simplicity and obviousness of message and its mostly shallow characterization.  The speedy shifts from scene to scene with little description and the changes in character that are propelled by external events (sometimes too contrived) and occur far too quickly make it feel like a screenplay.  The side characters as props, the lack of names for the main character or main setting, the simplistic notions, and the close make it read like a fable, but one that should have been at most a novella, at best a long short story, rather than a 200 page book.  In short, while it had a few good moments- a few times when the narrator sounded like an original, modern Holden; a few incisive comments on people or society-they were far too few and far between.  Not recommended 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs.. 
 SHARP AND INSIGHTFUL.  A VERY SATISFYING LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF SECRECY THAT PREVAILS AT THE BUSH WHITEHOUSE 
 Beyond Duality was a very disappointing book for me, primarily because to me it seemed that the title itself was very misleading.  I should have looked more closely at the cover photo, which expressed the actual content  of the book far more eloquently, more closely.  It depicts a fairly  disenchanted looking woman and man on the cover, each eyeing the other with  apparent non-comphrehension. Which is exactly what this book is about -  rather than going *beyond* duality,it seems to embrace it.  It is my  understanding that to truly evolve we need to confront and transcend  concepts as male, female, top, bottom, and instead realize that there are  simply people with different traits, needs, and personalities.  This book  is too quick to fall back into excuses and cliches that sound more like  metaphysical rhetoric for "it's a _______thing." The other  exercises fall more into a just too obvious kind of catagory.  Of course  stairways go both up and down, and neither is better than the other (an  actual example from the book.) I didn't find this insightful or useful. I  suppose my disappointment in Beyond Duality stems from the fact that I  expected transcendent, groundbreaking metaphysical ideas, and I got pop  psychology of the "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"  variety, and that was just the kind of outdated thinking I was trying to  avoid.  I prefer not  to give negative reviews, but I also believe that  people should have the opportunity to go into a book with a better  knowledge of what they're getting.  I hope this helps someone 
 Pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers, whose very existence and relevance is due to that king. What you will get from that kind of writing? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. Sound familiar? Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. Probably she does not care. Americans are lucky that they never had any king. Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS, Iran-Contra, welfare, deficits, funding mujahideens, cozy relationship with Saddam. Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler, happy citizens..."happily lived ever after". Basically, this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer.  Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don't know already. This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80's (which is nothing new in human civilizations). Secondly, she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans. But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan, except all the negative things, like Iran-Contra. In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings, characters of kings and the writings about them 
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 Unlike the Chicken Soup authors, Dan feels it's neccessary to add his opinion at the end of each story which leaves the impression he's telling the reader how to feel or react to the story.  These heartwarming, tender stories speak for themselves. It's a very diappointing purchase 
 Who would have believed that this absurd melodrama would have garnered such critical plaudits?  It's reads like Psycho meets Darby O'Gill.  No one in Ireland talks like the people in this play "do be talking".  Utterly offensive nonsense 
 "Salvador" completely discredits Joan Didion and all of her books. The two weeks she is believed to have "lived" in El Salvador was actually a mere four hours. Any truths in this book, and there are but a handful, have been obtained by outside sources, not by her own "research." I lived in El Salvador when she came in to gather info for her story. It is an outrage that she so flippantly used the sufferings of the Salvadorans to effect personal gain. If you want to read fiction, go ahead. She's a good storyteller. As a service to yourself, however, keep in mind that the author has almost zero first hand knowledge of what she writes. The only reason I have the book at all is that my father gave it to me. What a shame that he wasted his money on this piece of trash 
 The unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface.  100ft. would be pushing it 
 Very basic techniques for the readers new to spiritual healing. Nothing new or that has not been said better by more advanced authors 
 Year 1 was good.  Can't complain too much about it considering the price.  Then started year two.  I have to unplug the darn thing at least 10 times a day since the router just dies all of a sudden.  I don't know what to think.  I blame myself for buying the cheapest thing on the shelf but then for every person that raves about the Linksys there is another person that says its garbage.  I think a company out there needs to be build a solid router and not really worry about price because if it'll work and continue to work I think we'll all pay the higher price.  In short I wouldn't buy this router.  Pay more and buy the Linksys, I guess, but its a toss-up on what your experience will be with any wireless router *sigh* I just want a product that works 
 Simon Schama is a brilliant man. He knows Rembrandt, Holland, Rubens and many topics backwards and forwards. But he has no dramatic sense. He has no gift for compression. And his prose vacillates between insiteful and  flatulent. So reading this book becomes a very long and tiresome chore. I'm  no expert on Rembrandt, but I have read better analysis of the paintings in  other books. Overall, a tiresome and uninspiring effort 
 If you are a christian reading this book for REAL information about paganism or wicca, then in all fairness you should also include another book in your studies, The Truth About Witchcraft by Scott Cunningham.  Scott was a practicing wiccan and his economically priced little book is an overview about the myths and untruths surrounding this earth-based religion.  I believe that if you want information about a religion it is only fair to include a description of the religion from someone who practices it.  I am not saying that you shouldn't read a book about wicca simply because it is written by a christian, but keep in mind that Tim Baker is writing from the christian perspective and apparently does not truly understand wicca, witchcraft or satanism.  This is obviously not a definitive source for information and tells only one side of the issue.  PLEASE don't get all of your information from one side; in order to truly understand wicca, you need to go to an authority on wicca.  
 90% of all the books I read are historical fiction, and I don't read mysteries unless they are historical  period pieces. I quickly picked up this book with great anticipation of a well written literary who-done-it but very quickly found it such a struggle to read. I have read hundreds of historical novels, a lot within this medieval time period, and never have I had such a hard time with the language used. This author pulls out terms and words and phrases that I've never come across and I found this novel very difficult to read because of it. In fact some of the sentence structures and paragraphs just made no sense. I  found myself re-reading parts over and over because of the wording and structure being so odd and wondering if some of the words were made up. This style of writing ruins the flow and I dont feel it necessary. Mix that with characters that are so flat and lifeless, I gave up half way through the book due to total boredom. You get no feel for the main players, they have no personality or life to them. You don't love them, hate them. or relate to them, they are just sort of there. This theme of a medieval woman who is a doctor or healer is also not new, there are many other series similar that are much better. I'm frankly very surprised at the many other reviewers that raved over this very ho-hum poorly written book. 
 Clint should be embarrassed.  He made this during his "hot for Sondra Locke" period, which pretty much dooms any movie.  Never mind "Go ahead, make my day" - the big lines here include "only with humans", and Clint's definitive exposition on the proper condiments for a hot dog.  The resolution of the killings (never mind the hilarious impalement) is completely out of character.  It completely contradicts his character's beliefs from the earlier movies.  At least "The Dead Pool", which is a parody, features the killing of Jim Carrey.  
 I bought this book because of the enthusiastic reviews it received on the Amazon.com website.  Having looked through it, I am thoroughly disappointed.  The author is apparently either unaware of the great novels dealing with Benedict Arnold, beautifully and accurately written in the 1930's by Kenneth Roberts,or has chosen to ignore them.  I find this totally unacceptable, since much of what we know about the march to Quebec, the retreat and near loss of the Northern Army on Isle Aux Noix, and the Battle of Valcour Island came to light in "Arundel" and "Rabble in Arms".  Martin apparently wanted to write an academic version of Arnold's life, but his failure to cite Roberts renders the Martin book intellectually dishonest.  Further, that Martin could have failed to mention Roberts' collection of diaries entitled "The March on Quebec" is truly mind boggling.  If it would be possible to give the book zero stars, I would do so for it doesn't deserve the one I had to give it 
 I was very disapointed with the book. Expanded third edition was deceiving because I thought it was new - my oversight.  The book is out of date - I oversee a Center that teaches sex education and this was not helpful 
 Okay, this book was so absolutely basic that I could have written it.  I was extremely disappointed with how much I didn't learn from this book.  It is 45 pages long, so if you're expecting a good, interesting weekend read--this is not it.  There weren't any detailed case studies.  There weren't any crime scene pictures.  Just basic info on fingerprinting and skull re-construction and a little bit of this-and-that.  Extremely basic.  Recommended for the interested 11 year old, but not for anyone who wants to really learn the nitty-gritty of Forensic Anthropology

 If the reader knew absolutely nothing about oil production and read this book, then he or she would believe his claim that global production of crude oil will decline permanently in the very near future.  Deffeyes takes his cue from price fluctuations, and I, knowing nothing about petroleum exploration and refining and hearing a lot about 'Peak Oil' (made popular by such conspiratorial tomes as The Grand Chessboard, The Party's Over and Crossing the Rubicon), keep hearing that little statistician's nagging voice in my head, saying:  Could there be some other explanation for the price fluctuations?  We have seen this sort of thing before, folks, and we have covered this terrain before.  Whether the subject is the population bomb or the direction of stock prices, the drama is always the same: someone, usually an academic, grabs the media spotlight with dire prognostications emanating from his high-tech crystal ball (typically some mathematical formula or computer model bearing the illusion of precision), and predicts doom on the horizon if we do not change course and adopt his (typically totalitarian) prescription for renewed prosperity.  Unlike the endless parade of kooks past who have predicted The Demise of Civilization (or life as we know it), the author's  claim to fame is three-fold: first, he has worked in the oil industry, and had the good (?) sense to abandon it for academia just before the first oil shock (consider the historical performance of the global petroleum industry over the last four decades to see just how sensible that decision was); second, he is a geologist, and tries to impress (or rather, bore) us with an endless recitation of arcane technical information on oil exploration; and third, the coup de grace- he actually worked with the infamous M. King Hubbert.  All of these things are supposed to make his pitch both credible and ring true, and I guess for those who do not like to think too deeply about things,  his position really does overflow with truth and credibility.  Since I (nor anyone else) can not check the data he used to generate the estimates sprinkled liberally throughout the book for their truthfullness, that alone sends up red flags in my mind.  These estimates form the basis for his dire conclusions, and the admittedly amateur scientist and statistician in me says that if those estimates are flawed, then so too are the conclusions flowing from them.  In reading this text, and others like it, I am constantly nagged by the following questions:  Did Hubbert predict that all oil production would decline, or did he really say something else?  Oddly enough, Mr. Hubbert is long dead, so much the (in)famous Malthus, we can not consult him to hear what he has to say about things.  Could there be another explanation for the U.S. decline in oil production?  Could that explanation, in fact, have little or nothing to do with the amount of oil in the ground?  Given that we have some idea of the situation with OPEC (and to some extent, the U.S.) with respect to production and consumption, what about the situation outside of these two regions- such as in the oceans or in the Arctic/Antartic?  If the oil supply trend globally is on the decline, why in the hell are we seeing the trend for fuel economy standards in automobiles on the decline?  Could there be some other explanation for the recent rising trend in oil prices- one having perhaps a little something to do with causes firmly rooted in a history of misguided economic and foreign policy?  The author contends that poor countries will suffer the most under the scenario of world oil shortage because poor countries need energy to run the irrigation pumps necessary to produce food to feed themselves.  Granted, fuels from petroleum are one possible energy source, but there are others.  Ever hear of natural gas?  Since most of the poor countries also have abundant renewable resources (Brazil for example has both hydro and solar resources, as well as biomass) why not use this?  I strongly suspect (but can not prove with any certainty) that pricing problems we see today may have something to do with the sort of oil that we could produce versus the kind of oil we would ideally like to use, which incidentally OPEC has a lock on.  I also suspect that maybe domestic oil production has declined not because of Hubbert's Peak but rather, much like the decline of US domestic forestry, it costs less to import the kind of crude we like than it would to produce it domestically.  In sum, this book runs on par with other erroneous Apocalyptic tomes that depend on numerical tricks, intellectual sleights of hand, strangely hidden sources and data sets, illusions of precision and rigid certainty, such as those produced by Bjorn Lomborg, Lester Brown and Stephen Moore.  Readers looking for a bit more insight into the crude oil pricing problem, albeit in a historical context, would do well to consult Robert Stobaugh's and Daniel Yergin's eerily prophetic book Energy Future 
 You have to be truly annoying to write a book so bad that I keep reading despite myself, until I finish it. You have to be transcendently annoying for the book to be so bad that I feel compelled to spend four minutes of my life giving it a bad review. Chuck Klosterman, take a bow. You are truly annoying.  The quickest, surest, easiest way to be so annoying is to be shrill and self-justifying while expressing a series of opinions that are not merely idiotic, but willfully ignorant. Congratulations, Chuck Klosterman. You took the easy route to getting on my nerves, and the nerves of anybody who knows anything about real heavy metal music.   I shall summarize: he thinks Poison and Guns and Roses and the like are better than Priest or Danzig. Poison. Better than Priest. GNR. Better than Danzig. Or Metallica.   I kid you not.   Uh, let's see if I can come up with a metaphor, for those not familiar with the bands in question. Here goes: This is like saying, uh, that Stephen King is better than Shakespeare. Or that Andy Warhol is better than Michelangelo.  Get it? It's just stupid, and almost intentionally so. You can't argue with somebody like this. They're not worth it.  What is most annoying, of course, is that a lot of people agree with him and also make their annoying noises and write their annoying words until one just can't help but swat at these mosquitoes...  Okay, time's up. If I prevented one intelligent heavy metal fan from wasting time on this tar-baby of a book, it was worth it 
 AWFUL. JUST AWFUL. UNLESS YOU GRADUATED FROM EVELYN WOODS SPEED READING CLASS- YOURE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE WRITING AT THE BOTTOM. AND EVEN IF YOU COULD- YOU CANT WATCH THE WRITING AND THE MOVIE TOO. THE PLOT WAS STUPID, THE ACTING WAS BAD, THE CLICHES ARE TIRED. MAYBE IN 1910 THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIT- BUT TODAY ITS AMATEURISH AND JUST NOT GOOD. I DONT LIKE TO KNOCK SOMEONES ART...BUT THIS DOESNT DESERVE TO BE ON FILM 
 He did not talk about " Feminist" part equally with the other , and he quoted lots of paragraph from Bible just try to declare " such things are not aganist women ...." these are not proofs of "Both sides are right" . The content doesn't fit with the Title.  God did not create the man(Adam) and the woman(Eve) in the same way ! They are complemented but never be equal! Stop brainwashing us!  
 I was really disappointed with this item, especially as it's nutrition info is really amazing.  It's very gritty and strong tasting and did not blend well.  It's also dark green, which isn't a big deal for a lot of items but can turn things a very weird color depending on what you blend it with.    I am returning them as there are better tasting and equally nutritious protein powders available. 
 Being a teacher and Denzel Washington fan, I thought I might find some enjoyment and inspiration from a film purporting to illustrate the difficulties and solutions of the inner city high school experience. I experienced neither. Only frustration penetrated my senses as I wasted a couple of hours watching this film (after wasting ten bucks buying it)!  The story line might have worked, though I doubt it, if a few obvious needs had been mandated in the production and direction, like proper casting and a believable script. Worst of these offenses was the casting, as all of the "high school" students were at least twenty-five, and most older. Talk about suspension of disbelief! The same cast would have worked were they cast as the parents of the students! At times Denzel looked younger than the student he was mentoring. Indeed, it was preposterous.  I'm sure Mr. Washington looks upon this film as nothing more than a poor experience on the way to excellence, one of those setbacks we learn from to help us find our way.  Don't waste your time or money 
 I agree with the negative comments - I eventually stopped watching it - unconvincing acting - (and a small point that I found irritating - in TV movies about war, some of them have a "too-clean look" that make a film seem unrealistic. There is no dirt anywhere, as far as I could see - everybody looks too clean, the settings look too clean, and not realistic. The acting level was what finally turned me off. Glad it was on TV 
 I bought this book because I garnered great value from the previous books by Jeffrey Fox (all of which I gave 5 stars).  This one disappoints as there is very little new.  If you've read other books by Fox, avoid this one (just re-read the marketing chapters from Rainmaker).  The one chapter that kept me from completely tossing the book was titled "Always put the Brand Name in the Headline."  My advice to Fox: slow down the writing pace; let the ideas mature a bit more and stop the Instant Quizes 
 Make sure you buy this at a retailer that allows returns if it doesn't work. I bought one last week after a presentation. It looked and worked great at the presentation. I bought it because I had an immediate weekend-long project where I needed correct color. When I set up my new Eye-one/Display 2, all I could get was a "fail" on the emissions test, over and over - and never did get to testing my Mac LCD monitor. No response from the Eye-one "support" to my e-mails.   I brought the gadget back to the store that then told me I had moved it during the test or the screen had gone black - and that was the only reason it failed. Neither of those were true. ...However, I did get a refund. So, beware. I'd like to give it a 4 or 5 on the basis of what I saw the demo do, but for how the one I bought worked, I'd give it a zero. Had the "support" even bothered to respond, I would have tried to work with them rather than doing a return since I really did want it to work. Average the scores for a 2 
 There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a "realistic" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry 
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 24 years should be enough time to come up with SOMETHING new, but there is Nothing Very Special Here. Townshend has always had a pretty narrow range and he hasn't broken through any boundaries on this album. ('A Man In A Purple Dress' is pretty gutsy, and I detect a decidedly Anderson-esque bend toward a Christian world view. I like that; you might not) If you must spend your money, pop for the W/DVD version. This CD will get one more listen and then, I suspect, sit on the shelf ever after. If any more come out, I won't be fooled again 
 Beeing unemployed, I'm an agronomist here in Brazil.Then I know very much about energy and fuel from crops.Compared to ethanol, the same area produces 7 times more fuel then to biodiesel.If you read in portuguese, you can read my own article about biodisel in site http://www.israel3.com/article341.html . Biodiesel insn't a real source of energy.It's a way to transform waste(oil burned) into fuel.It will never be a great source of fuel in America, and in any other place in the world. Biogas, ethanol and hidrogenation of crops are the real possiblities of fuel from agricultural sources 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 [...]  R. Kent Hughes provides us with another entry into the already very crowded market for Christian books that are a mile wide and an inch deep.  He covers a tremendous variety of topics in an incredibly superficial fashion.  The book reads more like a PowerPoint presentation with  occasional witty anecdotes from the presenter.    My disappointment with this book set in with the reading of the second chapter entitled "Purity."   Now there's a topic that an entire book can be written on, but the author gives us a mere eleven pages, using the famous example of King David and his adulterous relationship with Bathsheba to present us with a five-point sermon on what David did wrong.  He begins the chapter with the usual rant about how the church is no different from the world in regards to sexual sin (true enough).  He then tells us about what David did wrong, and to conclude we get seven subdisciplines to practice in order to keep pure: "accountability", "prayer",  "memorization" (of scripture), "mind" (don't look at pornography), "hedges" (keep away from women), "reality" (you are a sexual being), "divine awareness" (practicing the presence of God).   Each of these subdisciplines gets a short explanation, never exceeding 300 words in length, and  "reality", the shortest of the seven, is explained in mere 52 words.  Brevity can be a wonderful thing, but there are times when it can come off sounding rather superficial.    The problem is that all these subdisciplines will not work if a person has emotional and personal issues that need to be overcome first. Any man can partake of these seven practices and still fall into temptation with the greatest of ease, as long as there exists issues in the heart that have never been fully dealt with.  Instead of dealing with the deeper issues regarding sexual sin, we get pat answers to apply to a wounded psyche, which is like applying band-aids to someone who is suffering from internal bleeding.   It's not always pride that causes a man to fall.    Another problem is the loose fashion in which Hughes uses the term "discipline."  For me discipline is a nearly synomous term with training, and in the Christian walk, there are just a few key disicplines that bring the greatest benefit.  But Hughes brings up many, many "disciplines" that just aren't true disciplines.  "Mind" and "reality" from the purity chapter are just two examples, and even purity itself.  Purity in the Christian sense is the abscense of sin, but not doing something isn't exactly what I would call a discpline.     Another mistake is the egalitarian nature in which Hughes presents all his various discplines.  No prioritization or hierarchy is given, he presents them in such a way that they all seem equally important.  But those who are succesfully living the Christian life only practice a few key displines, some of which are more practical than spiritual, like time management and goal setting.  In my own study of spiritual discplines, I've found there are three areas that are the most crucial: personal devotions, self-examination and spiritual direction.  While Hughes has some things to say concerning devotions, there isn't much, if anything concerning the other two.        Hughes also discusses the discipline of "church."  A very interesting topic, and one where he tells us that the church is "the grandest institution that the world has ever known."  But this statement demonstrates that Hughes has bought into the lie that the church is an "institution."  So are prisons and mental hospitals.  The church was not founded to be a grand institution, but to be a life transforming force on this earth.  The fact that we have institutionalized the church to the point of irrelevance is why Christianity is becoming a passing fad in so much of the Western world.    As it is with the church so should it be with Christian books: they to need to help be agents of change and transformation, not just a list of do's and don'ts.  Sadly Hughes' book is more along the lines of a moral dictionary.  Such a book might be helpful for a brand new believer who wants a type of encyclopedia of all the different aspects of Christian culture, but there isn't much meat there for more advanced believers to chew on.  But even a new believer might be quickly overwhelmed with all the various disciplines that Hughes brings forth.   If you are looking for a book that will act as agent of transformation, I highly recommend any of the books John Eldredge has written, especially "Wild at Heart." and "Waking the Dead."  One of the best books about true inner transformation is John and Paula Sanford's "The Transformation of Inner Man."  And for a book about discipline as a means of transformation, I highly recommend Foster's classic "Celebration of Discipline."  And of course the best book of all in regards to transformation is any good translation of the Holy Bible.    Personally, I really like Pastor Hughes and think very highly of him.  I even agree with most of the points he makes in his book, but this is not one of his better efforts, to put it mildly.  So upon returning this book, I purchased a different one that Hughes can rightly be proud of: The Holy Bible: English Standard Version.  Hughes served as a member of the ESV Translation Oversight Committee.    "Superficiality is the curse of our age"  - Richard Foste 
 I finally played this all the way through after 12 years. and found that it's actually not just a bad collection of songs, but also a feeble attempt to do another "Operation Mindcrime". I guess the group felt since the show of the same name had moderate success that they'd try another, but the songs for the most part were not strong enough, and in a time when heavy metal was obsolete, and the music world was in mourning of the grunge scene after Kurt Cobain's death, so the musical identity for rock was in limbo pretty much, and this was not a good offering. I don't know if anything could've been considered a good follow up to "Empire" because in order to do so the group would probably have to reinvent themselves. 
 There are no real performances here. Pretty ladies standing there not actually singing. Kinda boring. Music is fine if you like Celtic Yanni, but there's no reason to watch as there is no actual singing. If you are older, or don't feel like quality in music performance matters, perhaps you can overlook this... looks like many people have. Fake 
 Nighly stylized movie that uses Sky Captain CPG with an Equilibrium theme.   In the future, a blood disease creats a world of normals and hemophobes. I'm good with that part, and Mila Jovinovitch rocks as the comic book hero `Ultraviolet'. What doesn't rock is her ability to create weapons out of thin air. There is no explaination how, and the dumbass drones after her don't have the same ability. Personally, I wonder how a lowly rebel could have more at her disposal than a government funded ARMY of top notch killers!  The whole film is shot in CG touches a la Sky Captain and The World Of Tommorrow. This supposed to be about her being a rebel and rescuing a human child with a protein in his blood that can cure the world's `vampire' problem. In reality, it is simply an outlandish style of cinematography.  Normally, I would have given this a 1 star. Poor piece of film. Period. BUT, after the Resident Evil series, I felt MJ did a very nice job here. Thus the 2 stars.   Do not buy, but wsit until it is on cable, which I did. Even then, I got it on Starz, and used DVR time 
 Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.    In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately.  There is no excuse for liking unmoving, plastic dreck of this nature.   
 Turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after I gave up on it. I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my  neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it. I wondered whether, if I took just a few pages a day, I could eat it and get rid of the evidence. I offered it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. I took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. And then, eventually, voila! The rattling door! What a fine tome T-o-C is. Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic 
 Cluttered phraseology, erratic prepositions, dizzying suppositions and a tendency towards compulsive terminologicalism seem to be the hallmark of Derrida's work.  The deconstructionist tact in Specters of Marx has resulted in a collection of nearly incomprehensible thoughts, taking the shape of misguided, a-structural and often unintelligible sentences.  The book does not seem to have a beginning, middle or end, nor does it seem to carry themes from what chapter to the next (except for the repeated allusions to spirits, ghosts, specters, haunts, spuks, etc.). With all of that being said, I know that this is Derrida's point, to deconstruct language from its privileged space that it inhabits, to disassemble text brick by brick and to break apart the philosophical mortar until there is no foundation left to build upon. However, this raises a few flags for me. From where does Derrida derive the authority, or the power to give voice to the deconstructive effort?  Doesn't the process of de-privileging a text require authority from which to speak from?  Does Derrida's elite position as a pol-literati allow him some privileged vantage to see things more clearly than others?  Granting him that he might hold this position (for the purposes of argument) wouldn't it behoove him to make his writings more accessible, to the masses and academia alike?  Considering my relative nascence to Derrida's nonlinearity, and to his verbosity, maybe I am missing the point (in fact I truly believe that I am missing the point).  I will admit however, that the excessive neologisms, the confused waywardness, and the aberrant writing of Derrida may be artistic, and sometimes charming. I have found the reading of Derrida useful in that it helps me understand that writing or other texts may best be understood if they are removed from their privileged pedestal, that writing is just a representation of reality, a simulacra of simulacra which may have no meaning by itself.  But at the same time, I found Specters of Marx frustrating to read.  There were several times in this book where I read a sentence, or a paragraph, or a several pages and had absolutely no idea what it is I just read. If you enjoy postmodern deconstructivist literature then this book is for you; if you prefer to read something that makes some sense, I suggest you stay away 
 What a conincidence,  PM's senior researcher, 25-year-old Benjamin Chertoff, took credit for this tripe 
 Not happy ! I wanted to rate this item with zero star, if the system allowed me. 
 If I am not mistaken,this is Jonathan Kellerman's third book involving a suspect religious cult.  It gets a little tiresome.  The plot was not as suspenseful as his books usually are.  But it is easy reading, and the writing is entertaining enough to read if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan 
 I wish I'd read the existing reviews before buying this DVD....  A total waster of money, at any price!  My hopes totally sunk when the DVD started and immediately said that it contains NO music from Nickelback and NO performance footage.  The most Nickelback footage you get is a TINY backstage bit at the beginning.  The rest of the video talks about how they promoted themselves and the music scene in Vancouver.  If you are looking for "man on the street" (literally) opinions of Vancounver's music scene, then you'll love this!  But to say it has anything to do at all with Nickelback's story is bordering on fraud.  It shouldn't even be sold, as doing so encourages others to produce similar projects.  I'm ashamed to have purchased it and inadvertently added to the coffers of these crooks (meaning, the DVD's makers, not Amazon!) 
 This game is heavily developed based on the actual movie.  If you haven't seen the movie, and/or your kid was too young to understand the plot, then they might not get the game.    Most of the adventures are based on the story plot.  A lot of the adventures are a bit dumb, like McQueen bumping alphabet tires into a truck, McQueen tipping over the tractors based on counting smoke rings, McQueen herding the tractors back into the pen, McQueen driving down a long road and picking up shapes, McQueen driving down a road looking for Mack based on memory, McQueen dodging the firetruck water blast, etc.  The only adventure I liked was the forklift picking up tire numbers (odd vs. even) and installing them on the race car.  Don't buy this game unless your kid is obsessed with Cars 
 I found this book to be a bit too complicated for self- study (like most of us in America have to do incase we get an awful teacher). It has many complex concepts, but many concepts have been explained in a concise yet confusing manner (like molecular orbitals). At other instances, the book wanders too much into other areas, and hence fails to convey the essence of the topic. I had to bear with this book for too long. It is sufficiently advanced, for college level, but the concepts need to be more effectively explained. The book gives a bunch of examples, but most of the times, the problems at the back of the book cannot be understood by the examples themselves. (particularly when it comes to acid-base equillibria). The books tries to prove a theorem, or a derivation of a formula, mathematically, and the problems test your understanding, which often become difficult, since the book is not too clear on explaining concpets, just listing them out. If only the zumdahls had removed the thousands of pictures, and put in more words. Depends on the teacher, you know. If you have an excellent teacher, this book may not be so daunting. But if you have a rotten teacher, as I did, beware! Chemistry is a vital subject 
 I purchased this adaptor thinking I could use it to power my 7600. I was wrong. It makes so much RF noise I wonder why Sony even makes it. Still looking for a clean adaptor. 
 This book is utterly useless for both a beginner like me, and someone who knows C++ well. All it does is explain what each function does rather than teaching you how to use it. In the 2nd chapter alone, there's a 200-line program of all OpenGL functions that you're expected to understand by about 3 pages of explanation. I'm a beginning programmer who knows a lot about C, but not everything, and this book isn't helping me at all. Also, I can tell that it doesn't teach you much, as the end of book game example is slow and buggy. Go learn C++ then get an online tutorial or reference page, don't waste the money on this book 
 This product wasn't delivered to me for at least 2 1/2 weeks. After one review, the customer service rep from Allergy Be Gone emailed me bribing me to take my review off. He mentioned that Amazon would be reviewing his company, and he didn't want Amazon to see the negative comment. He promised me free filters and offered me a $20 gift certificate if I removed the comment. His name is Jason P, and he goes by judahp for his email account. What a jerk. I will never buy from Allergy Be Gone again 
 Not really helpful to the aspiring autobiographer, as Zinsser's approach to teaching the genre seems to be to present his own memoirs and explain how wonderful they are 
 It's not god awful, but the cheaper plug in one I have is easier to use, not as heavy and bulky, and gets the job done with out running out of steam 
 Joann T. Hackos's book offers some interesting concepts, such as information plan, project plan, and content specifications, to name a few. Her concepts are well hidden under mountains of text that the unfortunate reader has a difficult time finding or understanding her intentions. Her book is information technology-centered, and technical communication has so much to offer other industries, such as oil and gas, healthcare, and financial, regarding project and documentation management.  This book is not a good choice for college-level courses. 
 "Hedda Gabler" has to be one of the most boring plays I have ever read.  If you're looking for action in a play, then stay away from this one.  Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll House" was mesmerizing and captivating, and this play is the exact opposite.  There was no point to the plot and the ending served no purpose.  Hedda was bored - that's the point; just shameful.  I do not recommend 
 I bought this book as a present but when it arrived it definitely was not like what I expected.  There is only one project design with directions.  The rest of the book is just pictures of what other artists have done.  Maybe this would be a good book if you are a skilled carver but for a novice it may be difficult to replicate the designs without any directions 
 This is the same old liberal tripe repackaged into another paranoid "I Hate George W. Bush" tome.  Can't the left come up with anything better than this garbage?  Here's a summary of every one of these absurd books, including Hightower's:  George W. Bush is evil; George W. Bush is unintelligent; George W. Bush lied; George W. Bush stole the 2000 election; George W. Bush started the Iraq War to benefit Haliburton; George W. Bush lets corporations run the country...blah blah blah. It's the same tired crap with a different cover.    Don't waste your money 
 The "Two New Sciences" are required study at Thomas Aquinas College in California. I and a number of students have this paperback edition. The pages come loose and just keep coming loose as you study the propositions.  Even being very careful with the book, the pages still keep coming out.  I have heard a number of other people complain of this same problem.    Pretty much everyone here knows that the paperback edition falls apart and they only buy it since it is cheaper than the hardback.  I have no idea how the pages hold up on the hardback edition, but I hear that it is better than with the paperback.  So unless you intend to put it in a display case and read it from there, I urge you to skip the paperback version and get the hardback or get another publishing entirely (if such exists) until Wall & Emerson gets their act together and republishes this book, fixing the problem.  I rate two stars only because of the greatness of the text itself, subtracting three for the horrible binding.  
 The reader who said this book is challenging hit the nail right on the head. It is indeed very challenging to read this book and realize that it is written under non-fiction. Like Michael Moore's "documentary" which was more fiction than fact, American Dynasty should be listed under fiction not non-fiction. Of course the left wing liberals will like this book as much as they like all of the  other mindless, factless, feelgood garbage that permeated book store shelves up untill 13 months ago and were proven to be baseless nonsense. Some people want to believe which is to say, they probably want to believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and The Tooth Fairy too.  You can skip this one 
 I just finished reading this book, and the one that follows it: The Cat who Dropped a Bombshell.  Both of them are disappointing and not worth reading. And I now realize what the problem is. Dear Lilian is not writing these books anymore. She's either deceased or retired. Someone else is writing them. A person who doesn't have a clue as to how to spin a good mystery story. All through this book I kept waiting for the mystery to be presented, worked on, spun out and then solved. But it never happened. The book was boring with all its details and run-on commentary about things going on in the town. The step-son is presented and disappears, murders are hinted at but never resolved, the "guilty party" is discovered at the end, but dismissed with a shrug. Mysterious circumstances are presented and then dropped. What's the point? If the publishers want to continue this series, then they have to find a new writer who has some mystery writing experience, who can follow in Ms. Braun's footsteps, and continue the series with style 
 This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.  I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies.  They are either worse than this one (rare) or better than this one. As an example: Buffalo '66 is worse.  If you watch both in the same day, you will surely die 
 If you wish to believe you are permanently damaged, and blameless, and wish to stay damaged: This book is for you. Ms Miller's thesis is  that all of us have been damaged by our parents and we can never overcome that damage and loss of potential. While I am aware, after years as a psychotherapist, that some parents are genuinely abusive, I am also aware that maturity is transcending ones childhood and becoming whole. For some maturity is too much emotional work and they choose to remain damaged, blameless and whining victims. Their choice. Ms Miller further infuriates me by maintaining all children were abused and those believing they had a happy childhood are in denial, dellusional. This book offends me, as a psychotherapist, as a parent and as a mature adult who needs not be a victim of childhood. I suggest instead the Wolins book on Resiliency. And stop whining!!!! 
 I was not a fan of this book.  I'm sure on some levels it is very important and has some greatness to it, but I never found it.  I found the book to be boring and not once did it hold my attention.  While it may be a classic, I placed my copy on the bottom shelf 
 This writing is what brings out the positivist in the best of us.  Nonsense from beginning to end. What would Wittgenstein not say 
 I liked Ocean's Eleven but this movie was just ridiculous.  Someone seemed to think that if you get enough big celebrities in one place and try to make it "stylish" you'll have a good film.  Unfortunately, the plot, dialogue, and even the internal logic of the plot is just poorly done.  The clever banter isn't clever.  The plot is slow and dull.  And without giving too much away (although you really should pass on this movie!) there is a plot twist involving the Julia Roberts character that is so ridiculous as to be arrogant.  Overall, a terrible film and a terrible waste of everybody's time 
 Bill O'Reilly is a dinosaur that just doesn't get it.  In this book he shows how he hates American Gen X & Y culture.  Its time to move on Bill, you are a dieing bread.  American culture is about diversity and variety, it is always changing, too bad his closed mind can't handle that.  The culture war is really close minded vs. open minded people.  This wasn't a very good book 
 This book promises to depict the way in which caring of the mentally ill has changed over the last 150 years. I wish the author had kept his promise. Back when McLean was called the Boston Lunatic Asylum, life was a little different for the average schizophrenic patient. And the idea of tracing the development of psychiatry by way of a history of McLean is a great idea. Unfortunately, what we get instead is hodge-podge of Boston Brahmin gossip, architectural history, psychiatric theory, and mundane factoids. I was expecting anecdote, but I wanted revealing anecdote. For instance, Beam writes about all the McLean patients who had received lobotomies. But he never delves into how lobotomized patients acted or how they might have felt about the procedure. I would love to have known why old-time psychiatrists thought hydrotherapy was useful for depressed patients. Beam mentions hydrotherapy, but really doesn't do any more than skim the surface. I guess I wish the author had been someone with some background in mental health. As an aside, I thought it was interesting that the subtitle of the paperback ("Life and Death Inside America's Premier Mental Hospital") is different from that of the hardcover version ("The Rise and Fall of America's Premier Mental Hospital"). I remember when the book first came out that McLean administrators were unhappy with the hardcover title since it suggested that McLean was on the decline. Why would Beam have changed the name? I tend to think that the reasons had to do with selling more copies of his book rather than with any change of opinion on his part. If that is the case, then Beam is more than just a superficial writer, he is also a sell-out 
 If you didn't like the first book in this series, you won't like the second one either.  Same goes for the third book.   
 Umberto Lenzi's most notorious entry into the "Italian Cannibal" subgenre is a contender with Cannibal Holocaust with the most bloodshed. Whereas Cannibal Holocaust was a well made exploitation film, Ferox is just a standard Euro-trash film laden with shocking gore moments. A student travels into the deep Amazon with a group of friends to prove here thesis that cannibalism never existed. They of course find evidence to prove this wrong. Our characters meet up with two criminals (tied in with a poorly explained subplot that takes place in New York City) who, guilty by association, get the entire group into sickening torture situations by a vengeful cannibal tribe. As usual, in poor taste, there are some real animal killings. Most of the music was taken from Umerto Lenzi's previous cannibal film Eaten Alive! 
 "Redesigning Humans" is an attempt to deal with the growing debate about whether or not science and genetic manipulation should be used to try to "improve" on our species. As several other reviewers pointed out, this book can be summarized as "Genetic manipulation of the human race will happen, it's a good thing, we'll all be better off, and although there are moral considerations, we won't bother mentioning any of them here". The book is essentially this arguement, repeated over and over. There is very little concerning the science behind genetic manipulation and absolutely nothing on the ethics of undertaking the redesigning our species. This book could easily be compressed into a three page article without significant loss of content. As one who has spent the last twelve years in medical research (including gene therapy), I found the book to contain almost no science, nothing pertaining to the ethics of what is propossed, and to really have almost no content. I do not recommend it 
 I found this recording disappointing....the sonics are ok but say compared to the Allman's at this venue...it pales....it's interesting to hear Young in this incarnation...most of the songs mirror his Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere album... his redwoods backdrop..dog sitting there...pendleton shirt...it captures that time...just wish it sounded better...this is the 21st century...not eight track heaven.. 
 I returned the book.  The ideas were tired and the bunny rabbit cake was absolutely amatuerish in appearance in my opinion.  It was a good concept for a book but I felt that it should have offered more to bring a family closer together as they experienced the holiday or had some things in that  were standout creative or unique.  The book had torn tissue paper vases,  blown eggs, etc.  I have found more creative and unique ideas in the  magazine Family Fun 
 I did not enjoy his book. He makes a lot of self contradictions within his thesis.  He doesn't consistantly support his theory that a win-win negotiating model is not sufficient within a negotiating scenario.  
 I was not thrilled with this work.  Here's why:  The movie jumps about in non-logical fashion that distracts from the flow.  It is beautifully filmed with great costumes, colors, imagery but the acting is so bland, almost weak!  Christ, I wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate! The sex scenes were boring.  Maybe i should make films!  This is frustrating!! It had it's moments so, 2 stars.  Wish someone would make a movie about 'Narcissus and Goldmund' or 'Cloister and the Hearth'.  Now That would be Passionate! (unless Amblin or Touchstone did it). 
 I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money! 
 This wasn't such a bad novel, and I kind of enjoyed it.  Not great, but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly.  However, the ending really killed it for me.  It's too unnecessarily long.  Once the major conflict is resolved, the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah.  I wish I'd just put the book down after the rain because I would've left with a feeling of at least entertainment.  But after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications, only pages of explanations, I just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book.  Would've been three stars if it'd just known when to end 
 It's true that a woman's general health may play a role in her fertility (and certainly in her ability to carry a healthy pregnancy), and that certain medical problems can drastically increase the risk of infertility (untreated polycystic ovary syndrome, STDs).  This book might be useful in suggesting some testing that women in their early 30s might do to help them decide how long it might be relatively safe to delay trying to conceive.  But this book also contains some of the same hype that makes women mistakenly confident that they can easily get pregnant with their own eggs after age 40 (or even 45!):  "You can have it all. A challenging career. A satisfying personal life. A loving mate. And a baby when you're ready." (back cover)  "In addition to the women's revolution and the technological boom weighing in on the age of childbearing, it's become downright fashionable to be a mature mom. Our superstars are looking more capable and beautiful than ever with a baby in tow, including Geena Davis (first-time mom at age 46), Madonna (second-time mom at 41), Kim Basinger (gave birth at 44), and Susan Sarandon (who had babies at 39, 42, and 45). Former *cover* girls are now focused on their *baby* girls (and boys) including over-40 moms Christie Brinkley, Iman, and Cheryl Tiegs (mother of twins at 52 who used a surrogate to carry the babies, although the eggs were her own)." (pp 4-5)  It's true that most women can get PREGNANT and GIVE BIRTH in their 40s, but what this isn't telling you is that a very significant percentage cannot get pregnant with their own eggs in their 40s, and a majority cannot get pregnant with their own eggs in their late 40s.  If a woman is happy to go through several cycles of in vitro fertilization, spend tens of thousands of dollars for the medical procedures and the egg donor, and become pregnant with the genetic baby of another woman (as most of the celebrities mentioned above did), then yes, medical technology has much to offer - and that's wonderful! I don't at all mean to suggest anything negative about this way to become a mother.  But many women reading the tabloids and this book may not understand that that route (or adoption) is the route that they very well may HAVE to take if they delay childbearing until their 40s or perhaps even to their late 30s.  As a woman who didn't find my husband and marry until age 35, I understand well that there are plenty of weighty reasons not to have children younger, and I'm all in favor of options.  But I hope women's decisions will be informed ones.  This book is a mixed bag when it comes to helping women be informed 
 Carwash is a classic film in its own genre.  However, the DVD version is cut.  If you watch the Television broadcast version (Such as on BET: Black Entertainment Television) you will see the original scenes that were in the original theater version.  For instance, the scene with Danny DeVito in a jealous rage with his wife is NOT on the DVD. Nor is: The Hooker watching the apology; the extended bus scene; and NOT EVEN THE TOUCHING ENDING WITH MARSHA (Melanie Mayron).  I strongly encourage you to act on this DVD deciet by contacting Universal @ DVD Manufacturing 10 Universal City Plaza Universal City, CA 91601.  You can't email them because they don't recognize Carwash in their online library.    Another note; The "Widescreen" addition is NOT widescreen.  
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 If we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the Prague Spring and street protests in the U.S., as Kurlansky attempts in this book, the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year.  The reader is owed specifics, yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes.  Prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent, but prohibited it.  Chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government, however flawed, resulting from open debate.  A bigger difference could hardly be imagined.  But Kurlansky does see striking differences, albeit only in the post-1968 world.  The Soviet bloc began it's decent to oblivion, while the capitalist West avoided the same.  His disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean, though what manner of "revolution" he envisions is never rendered to specifics, likely for good reason.  But who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do 
 My impression of this movie is that it seems to have been a six-hour mini-series that was cut down to 116 minutes, and not too successfully.  The only plausible reason I can see for its utterly confusing and disjointed scenes would be that they were trying to create the uncertainty one would feel in a society recently disrupted by some cataclysmic event.  If there is any sort of plot, it is the attempt of a young man to try to care for the orphaned children.  He wants Emily to help him in this endeavor; however, it seems that every time they get together they engage in sex, even when the little kids are in the room with them!  Then, they sort of break up when the guy wants to take in some feral children, or at least children who live like they were brought up by some wild animal.    What the Victorian scenes have to do with the story is anybody's guess.  Some would suggest that it is some sort of fantasy Julie Christie is having.  Whatever the purpose of the Victorian scenes, twice they resort to nakedness.  Once is with a decidedly unsexy middle age, heavy woman stripping completely naked.  The second is when four-year-old Emily is sleeping, and her night gown has risen up; she turns over on her back, fully exposed from mid-chest down, and some man, presumably her father, covers her up.  If they needed to show fully naked children, it would seem to me to have been much more understandable to have a group bath of the filthy urchins that joined the children's group.  Little Emily coming uncovered, and being tucked in by a loving parent isn't anything any parent of a preschool daughter hasn't had naturally happen; it is that it just didn't seem to have anything to do with the catastrophe of the movie.  My conclusion is that this movie is too disjointed and erratic to be of much use in raising any personal or social issues that could be discussed.  After watching the movie one is much more likely to be asking what was that all about instead of discussing or thinking about some edifying issue it raises 
 There should beseveral pages of information about each state to make this book educational. It is not nearly enough for a 9-12 year old to learn from.  That is why we are returning it 
 This book is a good idea. But there is room for litterature that can tell the same in a more lively way with far fewer words. ...or can tell four time as much with the same number of pages. - The language of most of the authors is such that you wonder WHY they have chocen to say what they attempt to tell in such flowery ways. After a paragraph it's hard to remember "What did he try to tell me now." It's easier to think: "Yes. I can see that you have learnt a hole lot of words, and adjevtives in particular." - I have found litterature about the same topic, put in a different language that manage to do this far better. In fact I've found public reports that with regards to the ability to convey a thought is far more readable 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 Well, the author definitely spent a lot of time researching this book. That is obvious. I really thought this would be another Bonfire of the Vanities type of book about the rick and famous and their habits, lifestyle etc.  I am half way through the bookand I've had enough. There are about 5 paragraphs about each tenant that ever lived in 740 Park.This book is almost like a school textbook with a little history of this and that person except this book is about an apartment building. Not enough information on each tenant for me to develop an interest in the subject, just enough information on who lived in which apartment during which years.   The book started off well enough but after awhile, I lost complete interest in the history of each unit and who lived there, etc. I actually can not remember half the people who subleased, leased or bought the apartments after awhile.   Great attempt. The writer, as I mentioned, definitely did a through research on the history of this building and is obviously a gifted writer. However, a short and brief background information on each tenant failed to draw me in. I would recommend this book to anyone who is doing research in real estate in NY, but would not recommend this book for just reading for enjoyment. 
 I'm a feverent fan of Donald Trump and for that reason I wanted to like this book. So, I approached this book with very wide expectations. I was disappointed.  My first reaction upon reading this book was at how much it discusses theory over any actual practical knowledge. This book doesn't read like it was written by an experienced marketing executive has led proactive and aggressive marketing campaigns.. It reads like it was written by an academician that has never been bloodied or ever left his classroom.  For example - in this book, there is a detailed analysis of "Donald Trump, The Fragrance". It discusses how Estee Lauder sought to develop a fragrance with a smell that would communicate different aspects of Trump's personality, such as "confidence, success, and character". That sounds nice - except that it displays a profound ignorance of how the fragrance industry works. Any experienced marketing professional will tell you that when marketing colognes and perfumes, the smell of the fragrance is almost inconsequential. Colognes and perfumes are all about branding, branding, branding.. That's why 95% of a fragrance's success is the careful development of the print and television ads, which are ignored here.  As a testament to this, remember that Bill Gates made Windows 95 a popular brand by hiring a V.P. of Marketing from the perfume industry ("I know nothing about software. I know everything about branding").  Donald Trump is an experienced Marketeer, and I expected more than sweet theories on dominant buying propositions and the like. This is a book that lacks any real-world knowledge and looks like it was written by an academic such as the stuffy business school teacher in the Rodney Dangerfield movie "Back to School". It promotes conducting expensive surveys and focus groups to determine what your customers want, rather than studying the psychological buying motives of your target industry.  I'm not saying that this book is useless. If you know absolutely nothing about Marketing, this book can show you the raw theoretical basics. But there is little of practical real-world value.  Trump University is a fantastic concept, and if it was really run by Mr. Trump, and if the content was carefully administered by Mr. Trump, I have no doubt it would be creating multimillionaires every day. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump subcontracted out Trump U. to a small company that took old tapes and books on "How to Succeed in Real Estate" that never sold 15 years ago and pasted the Trump logo on it. It supplements this by sending subscribers to the Trump University mailing list spam for photo contests and drugs (diet drugs, pet medication, hoodia, etc). This book is about as useful as spam.  
 Warning spoilers...  In the worst installment of a bad series, Fitzchivalry wont die.  Perhaps the most interesting plot point of this whole contrived series is wasted entirely.  Fitz, who died, and rose again has his potentially interesting ordeal descrobed in perhaps the most boring way possible.  I supposed his dead body was infused with both wolf personality and human for a while (I guess souls mix when they are contained in a tiny brain), and of course the seizures.  Seizures trouble Fitz for a while, as long as they are convenient to the plot, and then, of course, they totally vanish.  While I found it really interesting that Fitz used to be dead, and the ramifications of that, we find that there are no ramifications whatsoever, except for a brief period of eliminate-the-wolf-behavior rehab.  I mean, he was reanimated after a period of time, but that's no big deal I guess.  Robin Hobb is such a good story teller, but she is horrible at plot.  Except in the Liveship traders series, but she must have written that one entirely differently, because you can't tell that this is the same author.  What she is good at is writing loveable characters, and slowly feeding you tidbits of knowledge about interesting things as the characters "learn" about them.  In other words she can "feed the fire" of the story well to keep interest.    But that doesn't mean she does it consistently, and this book is a great example of how even Hobb can utterly fail.  Robin relys solely on you LOVING the characters (which I feel she herself does) and she allows that to distract you from reasonable pacing.  This book starts out slow, then begins the ending phase of the master plot, and slowly slowly slowly panders through that and then ends in a rush.  Not to mention the fact that she knows nothing about plausibility.  This whole series is based on a character that is as loveable as your little brother, yet supposedly kills without compunction.  You know, an assassin.    This series asks people a simple question.  How would you describe an assassin?  Prior to reading this series you might say ruthless, cold, cruel, at best disaffected and callous.  Crafty certainly.  After reading this book, you would say, kind, affectionate, and loves dogs?  Add to that loyal to himself first, good natured, well liked, and an advisor to royalty?  So is Robin Hobb rethinking the role of an assassin?  No, you can't do that.  An assassin is an assassin.  You can't change that FACT.  No, she's creating a hero who was trained as an assassin, but who only functions as an assassin very very very few times at all, since that is a nasty business.  As kind and good natured as Fitz is, he never once questions the morality of killing someone because he was told in the weighty manner such a question deserves.  He never is actually put to any test.  So, Robin creates a hero, calls him an assassin, and swings the plot around to have him doing everying imaginable EXCEPT functioning as a cold-hearted killer.  He's a spy, a soldier, a telepathy partner, a wolf-buddy, and for some reason everyone just thinks he ought to be the hero.  When everything comes together, everyone just says Fitz, be the hero.  For no good reason at all (because you have telepathy does that make you the guy to go to?).  [...] Perhaps Robin thought the weirdness of the ending scenes would add a sort of tension, and of course, they were being persued, and so I guess that added drama.  But of course, the main threat, the "forged ones" were not really a threat anymore, but of course, you still have to resolve that issue, and was neatly done in the end.  But I felt the whole story, the drama of the "forged ones" really wasn't so dramatic, and I just don't get what caused them to behave just like they did.  On a fantasy scale, it was new, but not very interesting.  Robin does much better with dragons in the Liveship traders, and these dragons are just stupid.  And Verity-as-dragon is perhaps the dumbest of all.  Over all a slow build up for an overall letdown.  If I began Robin Hobb with this series, I would have never read her again.  I am forcing myself to finish the Tawny man series now, because I WANT to like her stuff.  But I don't know if I will EVER find enough time to finish that sleeper series.  Overall, try Ship of Magic, unless you are already invested in this, and have to have closure 
 As a teacher of mythology, I was delighted when I first discovered this  book. Reading it, however, was a disappointment. The author's embittered  tirad against men quickly wears thin and leaves you longing for a more  accurate and less obviously distorted exploration of this important  subject. While the author is to be commended for drawing our attention to  the crone's vital role in society, I hope this book will inspire a feminist  with less of an ax to grind to write a more accurate and psychologically  profound account of the crone 
 Take a catalog of tactical gear and weaponry (complete with gushing descriptions of brand names and specs).  Wind around it the outline of a half-thought-out plot, people it with cardboard characters, toss in one or two short-lived but totally predictable plot twists, and you've got a Brad Thor novel. Complete and utter drek.   The biggest mystery in this book is how a writer of so little talent manages to get published anywhere outside "Soldier of Fortune. 
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 Yeah, I know I'll get shot down for the low rating, but I don't really care. The book gets glowing reviews for the most part, because most people find it touching and beautiful, and people like reading something that makes them feel all warm inside. I appreciate the feeling as much as the next person, but, really, I need more to like a book!  Really, I looked forward to buying this book, and perhaps my biggest mistake is having high expectations of it. What a lovely title: The Color of Water. And the story behind it, of McBride's mother telling him that God has no color, God is the color of water, got me all riled up and made me salivate at the prospect of sitting down and reading this book.   Basically, the book is McBride's tribute to his white, Jewish (turned Christian) mother, a woman who manages to pull herself away at a young from her abusive father and start a life of her own. She marries a black man, which is taboo, manages to raise 12 children and put them all through college. I had two problems with the book after I read it: 1. I did not care for the style of the writing because it seemed kind of loose and lacking in tension, not really very 'colorful', not as lyrical as, say, the title's promise. McBride skips around through time looking for stories about his mother, looking for opportunities to praise her. In a way, I began to feel like the tribute was not so much a tribute to his mother as an act of desperate attention from one boy struggling with having been one of 12 children, trying to get Mommy's attention. There's nothing wrong with that, though it just seems a bit obvious to me, and I felt Mr. McBride should've put more 'story' into the story, instead of just using gooey admiration and half-remembered tales as a slippery foundation to stand on. The writing did drag after a while. It's not that I need firm structure in a memoir - the beauty of memoir is, in a way, its subjectivity - but memoir is still a tale to be told, and it's a storyteller's responsibility to use SOME objectivity while writing, to give a richer tapstry. McBride did not.   His mother had 12 children, and this was worth looking into. Yes, that she raised them all by herself is admirable, BUT there's a lot more to the story...his mother's story...her religious choices, for instance: Did she turn her back on being Jewish because her father was abusive? What did she feel connected to in Christianity, what made her feel more comfortable with it? It seems like she felt more accepted within the African-American coomunity, which is fine, but then in that case god is not the color of water, because god is actually within a very specific sphere for a very lonely, very young, poor woman.  Her story interested me and I was extremely frustrated that McBride would not deliver the goods. He speaks about her horrible years with her monster of a father, but also her kind mother (whom, incidentally, she abandons altogether)and leaves so many loose ends. The praise he gives just isnt enough. What about asking her how she felt about having a (second) husband who was only around for the weekends while she was stuck with 12 kids all week? How did he feel about it? No resentment really comes out in the book. No real feeling.    2. The Color of Water did not impressive to me because I did not find the story particularly unusual. SO much hype over something so common here. There are many, many blacks and whites with mixed backgrounds in the US. Not just black and white, but many other colors here (I, for one). This country, as we know, is a melting pot. McBride talks about his family as though it were the only one like this, which leads me to believe that he was extremely sheltered, and remained that way even after growing up. He also presumes a great deal. He presumes that we all know about the racial conflicts at the time, and even if we do, it wouldn't kill him to get into it and talk about it and give specific examples, to elaborate and use the opportunity. But no.  I wasn't crazy about this book...didn't find it nearly as provacative, as diverse, as rich, as lyrical as it could have been. I suppose it would not have been considered good manners by him to delve even more into his mother's more private life, but really! The woman that is Ruth disappears behind McBride's sweet praise, and I sense her story would've been truly interesting had and her son viewed her as not just a mother, but also woman.  And McBride too. His story would've been better if he would've written as a writer as well as a son, not just a lovesick son paying his dues to Mom.  I suppose the book is ok. It's not terrible. I did not fall in love with it, though I know most people have. I'm ok with not loving it though, and can honestly say that this was one of the very few times I've ever picked up a book because of hype, and to be sure, it's the last time 
 This collection of short essays he published in an English paper (and meant for an English audience) seem to miss the mark for American readers.  It's as if he published this because he needed money.  There was nothing original in this book, nothing really funny and what few authentically funny parts there were seemd trite and at times exaggerated.  I got tired of this book half-way through and gave up 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 Lots of dramatic images, just watch it muted.  The narrative is merely one long whine, and more often than not misstates details.  Shows numerous clips with no explanation or description given.  VERY short on details, long on opinion 
 Characters are flat. I don't really care about the Art and Music.  Murder mystery was so boring I found out that I didn't care who killed him.  Read 3/4 of the book and shut the pages 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 Having suffered 2 major depressive episodes in the last 6 years, I can assure those who swallow Breggin's nonsense hook, line and sinker that nobody could have "talked" me back to anything resembling "health."  The mental anguish I suffered during those episodes was unbearable and waiting for a quack like Breggin to use psychoanalysis or some other form of talk therapy to provide any relief would have taken far too long.  Financial and insurance considerations aside, talk therapies alone are simply too slow to achieve positive results.  No doubt pharmaceutical companies often drive treatment trends in a highly questionable manner both via perks to MD-psychiatrists and (the increasingly obnoxious) practice of direct advertising of prescription drugs to the public.  Nevertheless, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety meds and sleep aids HELP relieve the suffering quickly, which is what medicine should be all about, not ideology.  Only one of Breggin's points is valid, and that is the disturbing trend for nearly all MD-psychiatrists to focus on psycho-pharmacology to the exclusion of psychotherapy.  The current treatment model has the patient seeing a psychiatrist for meds management typically quarterly while also seeing a psychologist for psychotherapy anywhere from weekly to monthly.  It would seem that "one stop shopping" would not only make things more convenient for patients, but competence in multiple therapies would also make for a more effective and insightful professional.  Use meds to stablize the patient and minimize the suffering, then pursue cognitive and other talk therapies to provide coping skills and attack the environmental and experiential contributors to the disease. 
 Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine? Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman in America but all I hear is American educational institutions praising Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience". I don't deny that he has made some points worth considering in his book but many people have made the same points without whining and railing at humanity.  I would dearly like to say I had the patience to read this book all the way through but it is perhaps the only book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.   The phrase that I found mose running through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was "o'erweening arrogance". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way.  I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.  I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted. So, I'd love to pepper my "critique" with quotes that I found completely offensive and juvenile but that would mean getting the book again and I *really* don't want to do that 
 While this book provides a lot of technical information it was written over seven years ago.  The information provided is practically ancient in the high tech and ever changing world of IVF.  The author is very dry, clinical and frankly quite negative about the chances of success.  Again, this is due to the age of the book.  IVF success rates have increased dramatically since this book was published.  A much better, positive, timely and accurate book is The Couples Guide to IVF.  It was written in this century and it much more helpful, upbeat and informative.  
 Arnold Snyder has some interesting ideas as a gambling writer, but this new offering is a little disappointing.  The author explains how to make money from casino and poker bonuses. Basically, his method involves signing up with an internet casino, taking any bonus they have, then cashing out.   The trouble is that online gambling is illegal in most of the United States. If you could make hundreds of thousands of dollars doing this then it might be worthwhile, but as Snyder seems to admit, getting the money is really hard. Getting money out of an e-casino, judging by the problems Snyder's mentions, is not easy, they are very reluctant to pay up, many simply will take your money knowing you can't take them to court. Some will cheat: it is very easy to write a computer program which fixes the odds against you.  Even with honest e-casinos, you often have to wager eighty times the bonus or more before they will let you keep it!! You would end up losing your money most of the time!! Imagine trying to get a $100 bonus, having to wager $8000, and losing $600 or $700. It does happen!  If you check out the author's website, you see why he is promoting e-casinos-his site gets lots of money from links to internet casinos and he gets a percentage of the losses of people who go through those links. I think that is why he is recommending this type of "advantage play" rather than something respectable like card-counting.  Nevertheless, he does cover some of the common problems you face online in some detail. And, the section on poker is a good basic primer, if you like playing poker.  
 This film was a little disappointing.  There was less humor and more attempts at simple shock value that seemed to mostly entertain the people making the film.  Please don't make a third film 
 I use this every Sunday - the hinges broke after 5-6 uses.  I will be buying the Waring Pro next 
 I am a keen reader of music biographies, and this without a doubt or even a close contender, absolutely the worst I have ever read. The subject of the book is fascinating, it is the author that is the problem here.  David Bret is surely the most pretentious man to have ever put pen to paper. He doesn't seem to feel that a page is complete unless it has at least one "phrase francaise" in italics on it, where surely the English word would suffice. I speak French, so I can understand him, even though I find it extremely frustrating, but not everyone with an interest in Morrissey is bilingual and this is extremely alienating to the reader. It doesn't stop there though. Despite Bret's assertion that Morrissey doesn't speak a word of French, "not even a `merci' in-between songs at a concert", he gives Chapter 6 a French title- "On ne badine pas avec l'amour". Quite why this is appropriate for an English language biography on Morrissey is beyond me frankly. All I can think of is that David Bret wants the whole world to know that he can speak French. Well done David, give yourself a pat on the back.   Throughout the book he constantly creates comparisons between Morrissey and the French singers (and friends of David Bret), Edith Piaf (who I have at least heard of) and Barbara (who???) which quite frankly do not appear to be there. In my opinion, the low point of the book is when he claims that, "Few songs better sum up Morrissey's life than [.....] `There's a place in hell for me and my friends', later adapted into French by this author for Barbara" and then proceeds to quote his French translation rather than Morrissey's own words!!!! This sort of self-indulgence is absolutely inexcusable. Another exercise in self-indulgence comes at the start of Chapter 5. Each chapter starts with a quote, usually from Morrissey himself or from a music journalist, but in Chapter 5 we are treated to a quote by none other than Mr David Bret!! This is surely journalism at its absolute worst.  It's not even as is there is a decent biography lurking underneath all the pretension. A few dates, excruciatingly dull descriptions of certain concerts in minute details, and a frankly boring analysis of Morrissey's songs is pretty much all there is to this lamentable biography. The whole book tells us far more about the author than it does about Morrissey, it is littered with his own opinions, such as the pointless part where he informs us what his second favourite Morrissey song is, yet strangely without ever mentioning his favourite, he tells about his own godmother and about how the famous Barbara named a character in a play after him, yet it is very thin on actual content. He mentions an interview that Morrissey did with a magazine that was successful due to "the fact that [the journalist] published his comments verbatim [...] without attempting to draw attention to himself, as too often happens with the music press" Surely this must have been written with a trace of irony, as this book is the worst example that I have ever seen of an author being more concerned about drawing attention to himself than his subject.  Then of course there is the issue of sexuality. Looking at reviews of David Bret's other books seems to suggest that he has a certain fascination with homosexuality and bisexuality, so of course he has a field day with Morrissey, going over throwaway comments and hearsay repeatedly, without of course managing to draw any conclusions.   All in all this is a deeply unsatisfying attempt at a biography. In the first half of the book he jumps around from the 80's to the 90's and then back again, until you have no clue where you are, and then in the second half he seems to just rush through it as if desperate to finish. Maybe he was getting as bored of it as I was. His research seems to have extended only to looking under his bed through all his back issues of a certain French rock magazine and picking out quotes from Morrissey, and he has certainly never spoken to the man himself. He actually includes a quote from Morrissey talking about the first edition of this book when it came out, "It's unsettling to read supposedly factual accounts of you and your life from people who have never come within twenty feet of you"  Although after reading this book I feel I know absolutely nothing at all about Morrissey, I am absolutely certain he would LOATHE both the book and its author. David Bret is too obsessed with himself, Barbara, and the fact that he can speak French to actually engage us or tell us anything we want to know. Oh yes, and the `extensive' discography at the back doesn't even contain Vauxhall and I. Utterly pathetic 
 Received the order in a timely fashion however, the box was badly I mean badly damaged . It was a birthday gift for a family member . I always order early , mistake , returns are 30 days . We had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off- white carpeting . To make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together . Probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me . HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!!!! and your welcome for the carpet stain , all new things come rusty , you didn't know that  
 I actually began reading this book three seperate times.  I'm not typically the type to not finish what I've started, but the dense prose and pompous voices of the characters were extremely off-putting.  Some reviewers have said that they found the haughty nature of the characters amusing, but frankly it makes the characters unlikable. I'm even more upset by the reviews listed on the back of this book which exclaim it to be a "gripping tale" or an "engulfing detective story".  Totally false on both counts!  While I wouldn't say no to a refund, what I really want back is any brain space any memory of this story might be taking up. 
 Jill Nelson is just another angry, bitter, whiny black woman with an axe to grind.  This book is filled with the same old whining and cliches which have grown really old and tired.  Almost everything she touches on is so predictable whether it's accusing black men who date outside the race as being sellouts (while saying nothing of black women who do the same thing of course), demonizing the Million Man March, whining about the light skin/dark skin thing and basically ranting about how the black woman is a pathetic victim.  If it were a black man writing this foolishness, he'd be written off as an angry old coot in a minute.  Well that's exactly what Jill Nelson is as far as I'm concerned.   
 Beware! It is a fake, not a real genuine MAC lipstick. Do not buy the Amplified Creme from this seller, he has only fakes Amplified Cremes... I got a few. : 
 I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.  The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.  To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!  De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.  It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.  I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already 
 Did not fit into the handle bar on my recently purchased bike. It should have listed the minimum inside diameter of the handle bars it would accommodate 
 I thought this book was going to be a wonderful improvement on an 800 year old ideal, modernizing it to fit a less hostile and disgusting world. I was wrong. If you're against republicans and war, this book will infuriate you like it has done to me. Don't pick it up if your morals are not Christian conservative, do yourself a favor and find another mentor. I'd recommend anything by Gandhi or the Dalai Lama.   I give this book two stars only because the author presents his viewpoint well enough to be useful to those that agree with him. The rest of us were at a loss picking up this book 
 Harsh words, yes!  "Into the Garden......." was disappointing and quite a bit "out there". Way too new age. If you want a free copy just send me a SASE 
 I agree with other reviewers about positive points in this book, but what bothers me is the examples given : they all seem to be very special people : trainers, founders of training centers, vice-presidents of companies,.... This confirms obstacle 2 as given by the author : "only a few special people have true purpose in their lives".   I think we have a need for purpose in our lives, even if we are a gardener, a pizza boy, a cleaning lady, a sweatshop youngster sewing T-shirts in Laos, an office clerk doing standard routine work.  It is a pity that we find no such examples in this book.  From the book we get the impression that the only way to find a purpose is to quit our present job and to become a trainer, writer, etc...  but there are also other jobs to fill, I think.  Moreover, if everybody goes into training and/or writing, these jobs will loose their financial attractiveness, I suspect 
 This book might be of good use to a person with no idea of what college and university towns exist in the United States. But despite the great pains the author takes in the introductory chapter to tell us how many miles he traveled in researching it, for anyone -- like me -- who has looked into the subject a little Choose a College Town will feel slim and superficial, with a decided tilt toward the places -- Santa Cruz and Bennington, VT, e.g -- that the author already knows well.   I could also do without the cutesy (?) borrowing of obvious 60's song titles for chapter sub-heads.  Exam this in-store before buying.   
 I gave this book a try because I at least thought that even though this book is a negative portrayal of Saddam Hussein, I did not think that the authors would be so biased. This book is just the same old redundant hodgepodge of 'evil Saddam' mania that has been sweeping the US since the early 1990s. While many of Saddam Hussein's acts were ruthless and he certainly did abuse his authority, he DID do some good for Iraq, as strange as it may seem. If anyone here is looking for a fair and balanced book about Saddam Hussein, I highly reccommend 'Saddam Hussein-Politics of Revenge' by Said K. Aburish. The author himself worked for Saddam's regime until he quit because of his objections to Hussein's policies. If you want to read a good book about Saddam, don't waste your time with Saddam Hussein: A Political biography 
 Love research on folklore. And compilations of myth or legend. But this struck me as the 'ultra-lite' version. This book is not outstanding or special in any way. Suggest readers (whether child or adult) get this from the library before they decide to spend any money for their own copy. Glad I did. There are plenty of other mermaid books that contain stunning art and text.   
 Started out with such promise...then disintegrated into a bunch of 'come-on, you gotta be kidding'!  On the plus side, the writing was great, the plot was clever, and there were a bunch of side-notes that were quite fascinating.  Just wish it stuck more to real-life than surviving broken ribs to scuba diving the next minute 
 This book has a lot of information, but much of it panders to feminists and gays.  And looking at some of the illustrations will make you wish there were no pictures at all.  If you want a good, straightforward guide to sex I would recommend "hot sex: how to do it" 
 Having never read a Koontz novel before I was looking forward to my first one. So I picked this up. Boy, what a disappointment. For 469 pages all I kept asking myself is what is going on? Why is this happening and what's the point of the entire book? In short, I felt the entire book was a big mess. Koontz co-wrote this book with someone else and it reads like it. It seems that these two guys were locked in separate rooms and wrote two different stories and never bothered to talk to one another while they were writing.  Characters pop up and storylines are laid out that lead to nowhere. One character, who happens to be autistic, can only walk while he completes imaginary crossword puzzles in his mind. Sounds interesting but his story has no plot or ending whatsoever. I have no idea how this characted is connected to the other characters in this book.  For almost the first 50% of this book deals with pieces of what I was hoping would be a much larger, more coherent puzzle. I was waiting for something to happen but it never did. If Frankenstein is still alive than only a few people were murdered and it seems no one actually cared except two cops. Hardly what I would call earth shaking considering who the killer(s) could be.   I think I'll pass on any further Koontz novels for now. I was never a big fiction fan but friends of mine talked me into testing the waters with Koontz, Patterson, Brown, etc. I think I'll go back to by non-fiction books for awhile and save this tripe for the beach 
 I originally wrote a relatively favorable review for this book because it seemed to incorporate the best of the original Butler's Lives (a focus on meditating on the life of the saint) and the new calendar of saints (including many recent canonizations).  While it does do the second, I am afraid to say that it is woefully inadequate regarding the first.  In fact, it is probably just as bad as the Atwater/Thurston edition.  For instance, here is part of the section from January 27th on St. Angela Merici: "Accounts of her [St. Angela Merici's] childhood make her pious, rebelling against the fashions of the age, devoted to the legend of St. Ursula, and the recipient of a vision showing a great company of virgins and other saints coming down from heaven to her.  They included a dead sister, who invited her to form a great 'Company of Virgins,' which was what Angela had actually done by the time the account was written."  In other words, the author wants to point out that the story "must" not be true because it wasn't written down until after the alleged vision had been fulfilled.  Now, we are certainly not bound to believe all the accounts in the various lives of the saints, but I do not understand the point of drawing attention to the alleged falsity of a tale in the context of a meditative reading.  If the work seeks to be encyclopedic, it is much too short and you should check on the 12-vol. counterpart, but for a daily meditation (which it seems reasonable to assume such a work is designed to be), such statements are misplaced.  If the story is too absurd to be believed, just don't include it.  As a result, it is disappointing because it would be useful to have a modern Butler's that can be used for a daily devotional or meditation.  Instead, we are left with the old works that do not match the current calendar 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 So there i was surfing the net... listening to suicide kings in the background.... thinking... okay so i just won the Young Indian Jones trading card set... what ELSE should i get that has sean patrick flannery in it! A HA!  here we go... a movie with BRITNEY MURPHY as well- SCORE! Well... i was sadly sadly... very disturbed that i paid this much money for a movie that sucked this badly.... if you like quirky black comedies... this movie is for you... but not for me! Sean patrick flannery drives around with his wifes skeleton... britney murphy causes her fiance to kill himself because she doesn't want to marry him.... it all just sucked...  sean though... is still of course sexy sexy! and so is brtney murphy- but i think she looks better as a thin blond.. than a baby fat brunette... 
 the layout of this book is fine, but the printing is poor, the color is just not there...Rothko's work always evoke something in me when i look at it, but the coloring is so bad that it was just like looking at black and white rectangles in this book. Very disappointed. (refer to paper back edition 
 Daniel Pipes said about this book:  "With uncommon skill, Shlaim has managed-in the confines of a very small volume with very large margins-to pack misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense into 1994's worst book on the Middle East."  Well, is that true?  Probably.  But just to show everyone that I am not only tolerant and soft-hearted, but generous, I'll give this book not just one, but two stars!    You see, there are plenty of facts in this small book.  In addition to the misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense which it does indeed abound with.  Shlaim claims that the 1973 Yom Kippur War broke the diplomatic stalemate in the region and led to peace.  He's not the only one to have said this.  But I wouldn't consider saying something like this on a dare.  I'd be laughed out of town!   Could I say with a straight face that the way to start negotiations towards peace is to launch a war of aggression against a neighbor?  No.  And just how strong is the peace between Egypt and Israel anyway?  Not very.  It is more a cease-fire than a peace, with a constant barrage of anti-Israeli propaganda from the Egyptian side.  After that, we see Shlaim explain that land-poor Israel can have territory or peace.  Really?  I think it is more reasonable for those who want peace to permit land-poor nations to buy or keep something closer to their fair share of land.  In my opinion, Israel is more likely to have both territory and peace or neither of them than one or the other.  And the author says that Israel can have territory or American support.  Again, this could well be a false choice.  Even if Israel, for some reason, can not have both American support and territory, why ought one expect it to have American support if it does not have territory?  Shlaim sums up the problem of the Arabs versus the Jews.  Security pleases the Jews.  Fairness pleases the Arabs.  I wish this were true.  Let's see.  Fairness.  Does that mean letting everyone, including Jews and Arabs, buy land throughout the region and keep it?  Does that mean a Truth and Reconciliation session or two where the Arabs can apologize for their violence and aggression against Levantine Jews?  Sounds fair to me!  Shlaim is totally out of line to pretend that it is unfair to not steal Jewish land, or that it is unfair to allow Israel to stay on the map.  As for the Oslo peace accords, Shlaim praises them as the beginning of a new era.  Plenty of people were extremely suspicious of Oslo.  Shlaim was wrong here.  And those who were suspicious of Oslo generally had the right reasons to be suspicious.  I think that ought to make us more than a little suspicious of Shlaim.  Now, what does Shlaim recommend?  It is simple.  America is simply too much in favor of Israel!  Shlaim thinks we need a more "even-handed" approach.  And that (this was written before 9/11) America ought not "bolster Israel as a strategic partner in an unwinnable war against an imaginary Islamic threat."  Wow.  Imaginary.  But unbeatable.  Shlaim really took a strong view here.  I think 9/11 showed that we're dealing with a real, not an imaginary threat.  And in the long run, why shouldn't a war in favor of truth, justice, and human rights be winnable?  I see no reason to give up without even trying.  If you want to learn about war and peace in the Middle East, try some other book 
 The book was highly recommended by Blogger, radio talk show host, author HH, unfortunately I found it lacking.  The book rehashes ten communications rules we have all heard before (use short sentences, stay on message and repeat, etc.) and it gives (glaringly obvious), examples of communication success stories ( e.g. "plop, plop, fizz, fizz"....., and "Just do it", etc.).  I'd say pass on this one.  This is the first review i have ever written, this book was that disapointing 
 I don't know about the other songs but they have no right to make a Marilyn Manson song sound so bad, how dare they!!!! I am out raged! I love his version, wait, I love him too!! He he he!! He is gorgeous and very very sexy!! Now where was I? Oh yes, this album sucks big time, don't buy it other wise I will come after you and eat you, only kidding!!! Ha Ha Ha. Now you are probably going to buy it just to see if I will come after you because you think I am insane. Well I am telling you it is a mistake! It's your choice. Bye for now 
 Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking.  My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious.  I, however, am left wondering:  why?    I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors.  The characters are boring and flat.  His humor is downright stupid.  This book is not clever in the least.  If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.    I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel.  But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand.     
 This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life. I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down.  I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him.  I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a "Do Right Man" at all, but rather a wimp.  During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did.  From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job.   This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end 
 I had to read this book for class.  It wasn't that good.  Conversations get confusing because its not clear who is saying what.  It might be a small book but its tedious reading.  I'm usually a fast reader but it took me a couple of days just to get through 3 chapters.  I asked around at class and found that I was not the only one who had this problem.  Its less painful if you just get a summary or if you just get someone to tell you what happens 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 Thank God this dumbass looks like he does, otherwise he'd be broke and homeless.  He's an idoit 
 This book should be used as firewood not to entertain or educate kids.  How did the author get it published 
 I ordered this book as well as Special Addition Using Ms FP 2003  The only FP2003 book you'll ever need.  This is the book to get!!  The microsoft book does not really do a good job of fully explaining the topic.  To me it was very confusing.  The other book I just mentioned is 3 times as thick and goes from very basic to very advanced.  So as you grow the book will be there for all the information.  I will be returning this book and keeping the Special Addition.  
 This book is great! Assuming you already have a Ph. D. in Political Science. Otherwise this book is best reserved for drop quoting, or light reference. The author shows bias towards the United States' form of  Democracy, as is to be expected in such a book. The simplistic nature makes  the reader annoyed more than informed. The childish approach is suited for  school children, but not as appropriate as other books for real analysis 
 it makes a low humming noise.  if you listen loud enough, you won't hear it, but at low volume it's annoying.  also, when it is "off", then you still hear the hum 
 This is one of Clint's best, but the transfer is awful.   All dark scenes are grainy, highly pixellated.  The daylight scenes (fortunately the balance of the movie) are OK.  Movie 3 stars, transfer 1 star 
 i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.  
 I agree with most of the others, it worked okay for a couple of months... now, not only does it not charge my phone, but if I plug it into my phone, it immediately loses all charge!  It's also always falling out of the lighter plug.  I don't have that problem with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets 
 I agree with reviewer Zzzz. This book is a mass of twisted stories that seem totally unnecessary 
 I liked this book very much when I started reading it.  The authors' characterizations of sailing were right on the money.  The characters and plot start out interesting but it seems the book was rushed to a sloppy and confusing ending that left me dissatisfied and wanting more.  I kept waiting for somthing to tie things together, but it never happened 
 this book sucked. all the other people in my book group and I hated this book. there is only a stupid plot about a pig running awa 
 This won't be received well.  I know that.  But, there's little point in my writing this if I'm not going to be truthful. I've read this book and the book upon which this is written, and this is what I've found:  Joseph Campbell's Skeleton Key purports to explain the incomprehensible "masterwork" Finnegans Wake. It does offer up an explanation of sorts but this explanation, itself, makes little sense. Further, apart from a small "demonstration passage" early in the work, Campbell offers next-to-no evidence that what he divines is in the Wake itself.  Campbell believes that Finnegans Wake is the story of the cyclical nature of man as expressed in the writings of some obscure philosopher named Vico who, for all I can tell, found his greatest glory in the critical commentary on Finnegans Wake. That's well and good, but the Wake is a mass of 600+ pages of senseless rambling. Why does it take Joyce 600+ pages to communicate a story that Campbell can neatly summarize in the first fifteen pages of his work? Because, according to Campbell, Joyce tells this story over and over again in a "dream language."  According to Campbell, the Wake is one tiny story repeated a thousand times, enshrouded in a rebus-like pseudo-language of puns and portmanteaus. The only thing worse than the suspicion that Campbell is just as fradulent as Joyce is the suspicion that, maybe, he's right. If Campbell is right, then the Wake is transformed from a fairly decent practical joke played on the academic community into a nightmare of pointless, wasted effort. His, Joyce's, yours, and mine.  I cannot bring myself to conclude that Campbell was fraudelent; he seems sincere. So, I simply hold out the hope that he was honestly mistaken in his assessment of the work. Of course, it would be impossible to say whether he was right or wrong--the Wake, like the inkblot in a Rorshach test, will accomodate the human need for pattern recognition by supplying almost any concievable image. There's no way to "prove" any interpretation of the Wake right, or any other interpretation wrong. I could just as easily say that it's a tale about the colonization of Mars. I bet you I could find good textual evidence for it, and then defy you to prove it wasn't so.  Campbell, bound and determined to come up with a coherent tale that fits Joyce's almost-words, indeed produces *something*, though it, itself, is only on the borderlands of the rational. But is that something what Joyce had in mind when he sat down? How would we ever know? Those who need to believe that "Joyce was a genius" because that's how they'll build up their own cultural cachet, will continue to believe it no matter what I say. But those who approach the Wake, or this purported exegisis of it, with an open mind will realize that, for thousands of years men claimed to find meaning in tea-leaves and sheep's entrails, and pictures in the stars, but those images and tales lie more in our own minds than in the entities themselves 
 I started my first subscription to this one in 1980-81. It was EXCELLENT!! It had all kinds of great advice and help on real issues relating to "preventing" ailments/conditions.  Now it's a little advertising manual for drug users and fad dieters!  Wow...what a change now. I'm not interested in "paying" to read ads. I'll get my motivation and information on more reliable sources.  Besides, I got tired of all the little order forms that kept falling out on my lap while I rode the stationery bike!  What a waste of trees. : 
 This is book is filled with information that does not make sense. It's very clear to me that this author is not a teacher and just some Final Cut Pro head. Tom Wolsky should become a teacher before he starts writing books on how to learn Final Cut Pro. If you want to be confused, then buy this book 
 This is a very famous book, and so I looked forward to reading it with a lot of hope that it would help my game.  I found it to be pretty close to useless, and would certainly never recommend it to anyone.  It does, however, do a good job of exalting Harvey Penick, which may have been his purpose in publishing it 
 As the title of this anthology makes all too obvious, the essays in this volume are little more than a rehearsal of hackneyed, misinformed myths about radiation and nuclear materials. The authors seem to flaunt their almost complete ignorance of the subject they are addressing as a mark of virtue. The only redeeming aspect of this book is that it demonstrates the remarkable similarity between the attitudes of the academic left and the Christian right toward scientific matters which they are unwilling to understand or incapable of comprehending 
 Hugh Grant is not too offensive in this role. He is not too cutesy here, and that is something for which to be thankful. In the film Grant's character Michael is engaged to marry Gina, the daughter of an Italian-American mobster (played by James Caan). Michael is a successful auctioneer, and after his engagement to Gina, Gina's father starts using Michael and his connections to the art world to launder money. Soon the FBI is onto the scheme (with Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson as a particularly funny FBI officer). Michael attempts to hide these dealings from Gina (Michael of course did not want to get involved with all of this illicit activity in the first place but was railroaded-it is the mafia after all). When Gina finds out their relationship crumbles. An accident causes even more problems, potentially fatal ones. Overall this is not a great movie and not even particularly funny. However, you will be able to sit through it and maybe get some entertainment value from it 
 The very idea that this cheap piece of plastic could ever warrant a list price of $30 US makes my stomach hurt. This is a KNOCKOFF computer component, like buying a "ROLEX" on the streets of New York for $5, and shouldn't cost more than that, a price that factors in a cut for retailers and distributors as well.   The bootlegers that make those fake Rolexes probably own the factories that make junk like this.  I got one for 3 dollars on Ibiao dot com with FREE shipping and surprise, surprise, it did not work. And YES, it was the exact same as the one in the photo above.  A "real" one can be found for not too much more money and will work far better 
 THE CARS HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 1 DECENT SONG IN BYE BYE LOVE. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST PLAIN SUCK. I MEAN WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE LOUSY BANDS IN QUEEN, CARS, ACDC, BEATLES, STONES, WHO, STEVE MILLER, AND BOSTON? GOOD BANDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, GUNS N' ROSES, NIRVANA, GREEN DAY, AEROSMITH, AND JOE WALSH. DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE COMPILATION. GO GET A BETTER ALBUM FROM NIRVANA INSTED. PS THE CARS SUCK 
 I was pretty disappointed in this book.  It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be.  I was looking forward to hearing about these 24 dates, but most of the book is just Jack being a whiner.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, however, it never did.  I thought most of the characters were flat too.  
 I read these reviews and decided to check out Better Homes and Gardens home repair book. The first thing that struck me were all the water color illustrations that reminded me of some cheap school book from the 1950's.       I need to change the garbage disposal beneath a friend's sink and  decided to look up the procedure in this book. Hey guess what? There  WEREN'T ANY procedures for changing a garbage disposal! In fact, there was  not the first mention of garbage disposals in this entire book. It seems to  me to be a very basic household appliance that a lot of people may need to  install or replace. I then looked in the Black and Decker home repair book  and found several pages devoted entirely to installing a garbage disposal  with many COLOR PICTURES. This was enough for me to decide against the  Better Homes repair book. I still haven't bought the Black and Decker book  and may not, but it is far and away the better of these two books. Also,  the index in the Better Homes book was very lacking in many different  subjects/topics. Stanley also publishes a terrific home repair book that  you might want to consider. Bottom line before you buy one of these books,  make sure you do some comparisons between these home repair books using  examples of projects you might want to tackle. The reviewers who gave this  Better Homes book 5 stars must work for Better Homes and Gardens because  this book cetainly is NOT worth the money 
 This item is very cheaply made.  Some parts do not stay together, etc.  I am happy with the price I paid for it through Amazon---thankfully I didn't pay what it was selling for in stores! But did notice right after Christmas it was on clearance for approximately 70% off.  That alone lets you know it is not of the best quality.  My daughter tried to enjoy this toy, but with pieces falling off she just got fed up.  It has been the least played with of her toys.  She owns numerous Little Mommy products and really enjoys the dolls.  The retail prices of of the Toddler Doll and Activity Center certainly led me to believe they would have been of better quality 
 I bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another HP digital.  The camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used.  The delay between pictures is incredibly long.  The lens/shutter doesn't open properly.  (Two other family members who own Powershot A520's are having the same problems 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 A much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story.  The end was a disappointment and the middle laborious 
 DBI gives a pleasant overlook of the branding process illustrated with various examples. It is however not a guidline to creating/building/maintaining a brand, so in this the title is misleading.  Warning: There are tons of compairable books around of equal or better quality. Only for those you don't have to fork out +/- $99,- to buy it second hand here!!! The book is not antique, the book not a life altering experience and the content is not worth more than $20,- second hand, so beware not to be tricked into paying quadruple the price it is really worth 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 After one year in the real estate industry, I needed to clean my book shelf. This book was thrown into the box marked "useless".  Let me tell you why.  The first time I bought and read it, I had no real working experience and thought I got great information about industry. Thus I thought I was ahead of other newbies. I read this book so many times, underlined, and dog eared. Looking back, the only thing this book was right is "average income is very low". For the rest, unfortunately, I found this book actually mislead me too much and lead me to costly mistakes.   One example. The author suggested that office located in busy street is better for newbies. I found this was not true. I worked with 3 offices.    The other example is that the author suggested that bigger office is better for newbies. I found this is absolutely not true. The reality is it's much better to start with small office where you can easily find mentor. In reality, in large offices, competition among salespersons are high to the level that no one cares about helping newbies. Get the fact. Everyone is working on commission. They don't even wast time to go lunch with you!!! And here's the facts. This business of real estate sales is not really intellectual, not even to the level of professional. It's all about how much people you know and how much people know you. This is rather a business of convenience. Every other salesperson even in the same office is a potential enemy for your business!!! Why they help and teach you to suceed. It only reduces their chance of making listings and sales!!!  Once I realized this, after actually working in industry, I knew this book was useless and never refered to this book for anything.   One and a half year after I actaully got into the industry, I found the very useful book. If you are about to be a real estate salesperson, read "How to suceed in commercial real estate" by John L. Bowman. I know this is for commercial real estate. But this book is WAY BETTER than "Your First Year in Real Estate".   Don't make costly maistakes by reading "Your First Year in Real Estate". 80-90% newbies fail in first 3 months. Reading wrong books can be fatal for your career.          
 I was disappointed in the contents of the book.  Although some of the information was helpful, each chapter ended with how difficult it was to be an independent IT Consultant.  Also, the book is written from a UK perspective and does not focus on many aspects that are specific to the US, including new legislation (SOX) or sub-contracting 
 Well i am a big sunglass fan. i just love them so i was excited to get these. they seemed very cute. well when i got them the lenses were scratched and there was stuff on the sides of the glasses. this was my first purchase from this seller and honestly i dont think i will ever buy from them again 
 The set up for this novel is interesting, if a bit easy to anticipate in the first half. The father: stoic and crushed by his love for a flighty, mentally ill woman. The mother: beautiful, ravaged by her own mental sickness, seemingly self-obsessed and consumed by superficial things. The brother: distant and angry. The daughter: spunky with a desire to rise above it all, hungry for the love of her brother and father. I was never--not once--surprised by any of these characters until the father found an interest in the occult in the middle of the book, and by then, I just didn't buy his his sudden turn. Lots of things happened, but by the middle of the book, I kept thinking, when is something going to happen that moves me?    Part of the reason that so many events with the potential to elicit great empathy from the reader fail to do so is that the book feels like so much backstory, so much summary. We rarely get to be fully present in the past moment with the characters, and because of this, the characters feel very distant and stiff.  But ultimately, this book frustrated me because of the awkward, contorted prose. Look--I'm fine with fragments and run on sentences, but when there is no rhyme or reason as to why so many are being used, they lose their impact and importance. The sentence structures in this book are beyond affected, and they really take away from what could have been an interesting story. I quit reading 2/3 of the way in, I will admit. However, if I feel nothing by then, there is a problem 
 I can't beleive the amount of good reviews of this CD.  I have most of the Pat Metheny library and this CD is the worst by far.  It was like listening to all of his un-inspired, not-as-good, filler songs in one sitting.  Yuck!  Don't get me wrong, I love Pat Metheny's work, but this CD was just BAD 
 "Explorations in Quantum Computing" is an expensive book, but if  you are looking for a good introduction to quantum computing visit a  preprint server. A lot of free  and good introductions are available. Therefore there is no need to buy a  book without the necessary detailed information 
 DBF was trying something different with this book- and I appreciate that- but the effort just didn't gel.  Grace, a worldly travel agent, lets her overbearing extended family bully her emotionally.  This organized and ballesie travel agent, whose boyfriend does stem cell research, caves into that?  That premise didn't wash and Grace's extended and detailed faith crisis really wore me down.    DBF's humor was still there, but I disliked Grace's family so much, and tired of the overly described faith crisis, that I just became irritated and started skimming and flipping pages to get finished (I've never had to do that with a DBF book before).   The travel agent slant allowed DBF to describe other locales, but, DBF, please return to writing about the sea water and marsh of the Low Country.  That's what hooked us! 
 Take a good look at the headpiece on the cover, it's typical of the styles you'll find inside.  If you'd like to make a hideous 80's style headpiece with fake flowers, pearl sprays, and large poufs, then this is the book for you.  Though there's a brief discussion of the different lengths of veils, the author does not explain how to cut the veiling to achieve different shapes, and the poorly drawn illustrations are inadequate to demonstrate actually attaching the veil to the comb or headpiece, which for most styles you have to do in a somewhat counterintuitive way to hide the comb, and which the book does not mention or illustrate.  However, there are entire pages dedicated to oudated topics such as decorating a banana clip and covering a pillbox hat.  There are NINE pages discussing picture/portrait hats and even a discussion of cowboy hats (I love the suggestion that you add a tiara to your cowboy hat to "formalize it"), but very little that's relevant for the modern bride.    I can't believe this book has copyright dates of 1996 and 2001, as these styles were dated even then.  The whole book is in black and white, and there are no photos, just poorly done line drawings.  Though you might be able to pull a few basic techniques from this book, your time would be better spent visiting a bridal shop and studying the construction of the veils there, which won't cost you a dime.  If you need a book to tell you to keep your veil away from your cat (seriously, there's even a drawing), or to warn you of the slip and fall dangers of a runaway pearl or scraps of tulle, maybe craft projects involving hot glue guns and sharp objects aren't your best choice.  For me, this was a total waste of money 
 I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone as a first Kellerman's novel. There are too many medical jargons and terms as if Kellerman is trying to show off his medical knowledge. There are just too many unnecessary references to either the rarer or more serious and feared disorders unrelated to the story and thus causing a lot of side tracking which to me is a pure waste of time reading and boring to readers especially those with medical knowledge. It took me a long long time to finish this novel and thought of discarding it numerous times even when I was more than half way through the novel! This is especially so after having read the very exciting Robert Crais's "Demolition Angel" followed by Lee Child's "One Shot".  The story in this book are also full of loop holes and I cannot buy the idea of a Conspiracy Club using Jeremy to get to the killer and allowing more murders to take place while he was stressfully doing so. However, I must admit that I did enjoy reading a couple of Kellerman's other novels "Murder Book" & "When the Bough Breaks" quite some time ago 
 Although I love Enya and have several of her CD's, I agree with several others on pricing.  Therefore, I shall pass on purchasing this CD.  Sometimes, a message needs to be sent that consumers reach a limit.  Beyond that, they shop elsewhere and for a different product.  In this case, Yanni is one of my options 
 The recipes are fine, but the book does not contain an index or a table of contents.  Recipes are organized by time of day you might want to make them.  If you read cookbooks cover to cover then you'll be ok.  The only way to find a recipe is to flip through every page in the book.  
 In all meaning of the word stay away 
 I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox.  I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo.  It was very disappointing.  The picture was little on my high def screen.  It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen.  I even tried changing the aspect on my television.  No improvement.  Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup 
 I find it has few uses. There is one hole on each side, so it can not be taken on rainy or snowy days. And in summer, it is a little warm to wear it. But it is cheap which is its most advantage 
 This book gives lots of chemical demonstration ideas.  However, some are entirely too dangerous to do.  You must use a lot of common sense when considering doing any of these demonstrations.  Some are not safe at all.  Mercury and CCl4 are EPA regulated.  It's not advisable to put ethanol in your mouth to spit out in front of students...  This only demonstrates bad lab techniques.  Make sure you do the first experiment in the book outside or in a fume hood.  It releases a strong odor and an acid vapor.  Definitely not something you want your students breathing 
 This is one of the worst films for kids I have ever seen with my four year old son.  It is built around fear, bullies, aggression, and ugly stereotypes.  This film is a bonanza for therapists and sociologists, and it goes a long way towards explaining some of the pathologies of this society.  How about a movie that lets kids be kids, instead of this onslaught of cheap sentiments and terror?  The calculated story uses every trick to scare kids.  The limited imagination of the story writers is particularly insulting. Is everything just about good and evil and the fight for survival?  For young kids??  In many ways the film is a throwback to Cold War films such as Red Dawn (1984), in which school kids fought a Soviet invasion (no kidding!).  Is "A Bug's Life" how we are supposed to prepare our kids for the war on terrorism?  In sum, this film is a toxic brew.  Kids deserve better.   
 I didn't like this book.  It didn't knock my socks off 
 I didn't like the book because it has no action.Paul Fliechman, the only action you had was when sae young got beat up and thats what I thought about SEED FOLKS.        
 I am a fan of DBZ, I am a fan of Goten, I think Hercule is funny and I think #18 is hot. Yet this movie sucked! It was missing what makes DBZ so great: lots of action and a great plot. Broly is overused and this completely ruins him. Like most DBZ movies, it doesn't fit into the timeline. If we worked it in, then Goten and Trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the Fusion technique. Had this movie taken place after then, the fight would be a lot more interesting.  In short, if you want to see every DBZ movie, then rent it. If you insist on collecting the whole series, wait until Movie Collection #4 comes out 
 It is not because Kim is fat, ugly, or inarticulate that I would not recommend his book. Nor is it because he is a failed PhD History student from UCLA, but because this man is so obnoxious and unintelligent that it is unreal! I have had the displeasure of meeting this man and seeing the offence he causes to many people with his badly-argued trite (note: to sit in a room full of biblical scholars and claim that you know more than they because you are an [albeit failed] historian is not a good idea). I would recommend this book as an example of historical scholarship in as much the same way as Eric von Dänicken's Chariots of the Gods 
 I got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. I feel I was ripped off. The video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. The same goes for the pictures. Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. The audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which I was able to remove with my audio editing software. Otherwise, the audio recording and playback were "acceptable," at best. This device is useful only as an audio recorder/MP3 player, and is not really a bargain 
 Many times while reading this book I felt the urge to just toss it into the trash.  I read this book just for the simple fact that I am two books into it and have enjoyed the previous ones enough to continue.  Slow moving and slow reading.  Sad part is I will continue to read this series to the end because it does show some promise.  We shall see 
 This book suffered from the same things the movie did--namely, a lack of action.  The book even left out some of the major parts, like a great deal of the space-based assault on the second Death Star, and instead concentrated on intangible elements like the Force.  Don't get me wrong--I like the Force--it's just that it does not lend itself to description in a book 
 I purchased this after reading rave reviews as well as the recommendation by my company and was very disappointed. Even though I have a BA in Business, I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to learn.  However, I was disappointed at how much Charan oversimplified some basic terms and didn't even give a thorough defintion of "velocity" -- one of his key points.  I read in just a few hours and am giving to goodwill -- one of the few books I won't put in my home library 
 This dress up trunk is of very poor quality.  All the dress up items are thin, flimsy and poorly made with frayed unfinished hems and edges.  The trunk itself won't last more than 5 minutes, if you can get it to stay  together at all.  Don't waste you time or money!  You and your child will be sorely disappointed 
 I find this book personally insulting and full of revisionist conclusions. As a Romani who lost Grandmother and many Aunts and Uncles in the Porrajmos (the devouring in Romany)I am outraged that once again we, the victims of this insanity are blamed for the crimes committed against us. That ANY victims of the Holocaust are essentially blamed for their own demise is cruel and unjustified. I also contest, and detest, Mr. Lewy's conclustion that the Roma people were not racially marked for extermination: this is both absurd and untrue as withnessed by the nazi's own words, we were "lives unworthy of life, we were criminals due to our genetics, Germany must be cleansed of the Gypsy plague" etc. An inaccurate book full of racial sterotypes, the gist of which was used by the nazi's as justification for the extermination of the Roma in the first place and is still being used to justify the persecution of Roma today. Horrid book 
 As born and bred New Yorker I have always been fascinated with the WTC project as a whole. I can remember going to see them erected from a spot in Queens with my grandfather. So after 9/11 my interest in them was even greater. I approached this book as a possible insight giver on the construction and workings of these true landmarks. I was very wrong. Content was more towards the history of downtown NYC and the political as well as the private backroom dealings in getting them built. Little mention was spent on the building and maintaining them. The writing style was more of a thesis type, that resembled anger toward federal, state and local government and there policies. If your are looking for a book that will give insight on the engineering marvel that they were, then this is not the book. Save your money, and look somewhere els 
 Maybe I'm jaded but I found most of these stories anything but miraculous.  Perhaps "humdrum" (NO goosebumps). I gave 1 star because it did prompt me to appreciate the many, many similar experiences in my life.  Unless I am some kind of miracle magnet, the point I got from reading this was to appreciate ordinary occurances as "miracles", which is not a bad thing.  It seemed as if these were stories from the Vissells, their family and their friends (most were from similar professions).  I was really hoping for a collection of stories from all corners of the globe, stories that really evoke thoughts of the miraculous and maybe even add to my faith in a benevolent universe.  What I got was more of a self-congratulatory marketing piece 
 This book was absolutely the most slow-moving book in the world. I mean, at first, it looked good, but immediately became something like a chapter from a socials textbook... This is definitly a boring book. Thomas and Elenor are two of the most un-dynamic characters I've ever heard of. All the events that happen in the book are a little dull as well.. 
   Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM's unhealthy cost structure. The  company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the  primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and  how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore  is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
 I have read half of Jodi Picoult's novels and this one was such a disappointment. I didn't care for any of the characters and just wanted to scream during the last 50 pages. I only finished it so I could find out what happened. After reading My Sister's Keeper, Vanishing Acts, and Picture Perfect (3 of the best novels I have ever read) this one was a huge let down. It felt very impersonal and boring 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 I dont know if Gann is so bad as Larry Williams says in his book The Right Stock at the right time and in his site, but I agree that this book is extremely boring. It has time series descriptions as: Monday 10.8, tuesday 9.5, wednesday 9.7, thursday 10.2, friday holiday etc... that could be better presented by a chart. Also his 3 point rule is poorly described. The paper quality is also poor. Only the first chapter is interesting because of the rules (some advice) that you can read cheaply on one of the book reviews. Overall, boring, tedious, expensive and not very informative 
 I was impressed by the writer's skill in creating beautiful prose. However, I did not get anything else out of the book. Forgettable characters, thin plot, endless descriptions, and ultimately dull.    Seemed like the writer was writing the book for himself and no one else. Rated two stars because of writer's talent and because I enjoyed the first half. Take three stars off for the meandering second half and my other complaints 
 This book was a huge disappointment. It's content is weak in almost all sections with much of the information available from either the Internet or you local photo lab. I didn't find it very useful at all and I'm even tempted to send it back.  The book is pretty much broken up into the three section as described in the book's title. The first part brushes over optimising your workspace - calibrating your monitor - and selecting a printer and then basic printing output. Things most people know already.   The second goes into a bit more depth regarding getting your pics on the web: registering a domain name, selecting a hosting company, etc. Information you'll find better provided by a quick search in any web search engine. However, one of my main gripes is that it reads like a magazine review of 3rd party programs you should buy to help with the web authoring in html. In fact it advises using Macromedia Dreamweaver.  A program which cost more than 500 USD. Now, I understand that writing html sounds complicated to the novice but you would - honestly - be better served and save some money from learning a bit from any basic html/web authoring book(any of the O'Reilly books are well recommended) Creating a basic html web gallery is not complicated.   The final part of the book continues on the team of glossing over the subject. It briefly mentions approaching galleries and selling on the Interent. I was expecting so much more from ths section but I really didn't learn much more than I knew already.   I find it hard to believe that one of the reviews here gives this book 5 stars yet points out some of the same failings of the book as me. The book has good intentions but just doesn't deliver the level of content and information required to make really useful. 
 One of the few titles on this subject I could find that included photographs, but very disappointing.  The models are bland and distant-looking; they don't seem spiritually or sexually involved.  And the  text was so light-weight, I have gotten better, more complete information  from articles.  Perhaps enough for someone who wants a taste of the exotic,  but not challenging enough intellectually or spiritually 
 Sorry SleepMD - we are not impressed.  Not only did SleepMD not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too.  Today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off.  No - I did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed. More like we were run over during the night. I wanted to inquire to the company in person - but can't find a website to do so.  So I plan to write. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It's a waste of money 
 Sue Monk Kidd was raised in the conservative South; she went to charm school; several of the men in her family are Baptist ministers; and, for many years, she earned a living as an inspirational Christian writer (get the picture?).  For most of her adult life, Kidd never questioned her faith or her femininity ... that is, not until she witnessed an episode of sexual harassment involving her teenage daughter.  Following this incident, Kidd gradually began to realize that the Church and society are patriarchal systems.  The first part of this book deals with Kidd's spiritual/feminist awakening, while the second part of this book deals with her evolving faith.  While I have a lot of respect for Kidd's willingness to question herself and her deepest beliefs, her book was of virtually no use to me.    I think my background has a lot to do with my disinterest.  I'm a good 20 years younger than Kidd, and I've considered myself a "feminist" since I was about 2 years old.  So - all of these bright ideas that Kidd was having - they really go without saying for me.  I mean - her realizations that women are not second to men and that we have been "socialized" to believe certain things about gender ... well, these are notions that have been explored and re-explored about a zillion times.  Anyone with even a remote understanding of feminist theory is going to be really bored by the first half of this book, which is primarily devoted to her not-so-profound awakening.  With that said - if you are not very well-versed in feminism, or if you come from a really conservative background (like Kidd) - her awakening might be of interest to you.  Personally, I found the second half of the book a bit more interesting, as Kidd talked occasionally about the history of Christianity and the history of women in the Church; I definitely learned some new things.  However, I imagine that there are more useful books that explore the history of women and Christianity.  Unfortunately, I do not know of any at this time.  There are 3 additional complaints I have with this book:     1.  Kidd overuses metaphors!  Don't get me wrong.  It's not that I'm not a "poetic" type (I was an English major in college) - it's just that she uses metaphors to the point that they become tedious.  This book should have been edited a bit more carefully.      2.  Throughout this text, Kidd frequently describes her dreams.  I find this really frustrating, because her "dreams" are so evidently contrived.  Does anyone really believe that Kidd had a dream in which she crawled into the empty lap of a Pieta-like statue, and that the Virgin healed her wounds?  All of her so-called dreams are *uncannily* relevant to her spiritual journey.  I felt manipulated each time I read about one.         3.  She talks a lot about the Devine Feminine and uses a lot of female language.  That's great.  I think it's really important that Christians counter the always-male descriptions of the Divine (i.e. God, Father, He, etc.).  However, Kidd also talks frequently about the "feminine soul."  I think it's dangerous to assign a specifically "feminine" soul to all women; this implies that there is something inherently "feminine" about women and their spirituality and something inherently "masculine" about men and their spirituality.  Does this not counter the very idea that women are *socialized* to be feminine and men are *socialized* to be masculine?  I think it does.  And - along those same lines - Kidd frequently describes specifically feminine rituals or moments of feminine worship.  Almost every time, these rituals and moments of worship have to do with nature - or maybe with spontaneous dancing or singing.  It seemed to me that she was describing women as somehow more "natural" and "earthly" than men.  This is certainly not a new idea.  For centuries, women have been associated with the earth and base instincts, while men have been associated with the divine and more spiritual and intellectual pursuits.  And while I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to bring the earth and nature back into Christianity - I think Kidd is making a big mistake in her implication that women, specifically, are connected to the earth.   In summary - if you are in a situation similar to the situation Kidd was in when she had her awakening and would like to learn more about a woman's spiritual/feminist journey - this would be an okay book for you (though I really only recommend it half-heartedly).  But, if you already have a general understanding of feminism - or if you are put off by the notion that women are "earthly" - I wouldn't recommend this book 
 I am a 38 year old adoptee and adoptive parent.  I was adopted as an infant, as was my own adopted daughter.  As others have pointed out, this book is clearly both overly negative and overly dramatic.  I would like to add that following the advice of the author could even be very harmful to your adopted child.  In particular, I was taken aback by the author's suggestion that you should essentially tell your child that he or she must have unresolved grief issues and help him or her uncover them.  That is just plain wrong.  Please understand that it is entirely likely that your child, especially if he or she was adpoted as an infant, will never have any significant feelings of loss or grief.  DO NOT CREATE THOSE FEELINGS OUT OF SOME MISGUIDED EFFORT TO HELP YOUR CHILD "UNCOVER" SUPPOSEDLY SUPPRESSED FEELINGS.  In my own experience, I have always known that I was adopted and that I have been loved by my parents.  I simply have no negative feelings regarding my own adoption.  None.  However, if my parents had read this book when I was a child and decided that they needed to tell me that I must have those feelings and we had to find them and focus on them, I undoubtedly would have needed years and years of therapy.  The advice in this book might have some helpful relevance to those who are adopted as older childen.  However, for those adopted a infants, what you should do is tell them early and often that they are adopted and loved.  Let them know that you are always available to talk with them about any feelings or questions they might have.  If they have questions, answer them matter of factly.  Do not burden them with negative feelings that they probably do not have and will never develop 
 I was disappointed with this book because I believe it too often portrayed the day to day life of a full-time mom as drudgery and boredom.  While, of course, it is not always exciting and fun, nothing truly worthwhile is easy.  As a full-time mom, I think this book was trying so hard not to offend either side and appear nonjudgmental that it lacked a clear focus.  (... 
 Do not but this cd or any EMI copy protected cd's if you want to put them on an Ipod Nano.  I am pretty sure it is not possible.  I would never have bought it if I had known.  I am a more educated consumer now, at least.  I hate it for Merle.  I have listened to a few songs and they are solid good Merle Haggard.  It is a shame here he is with a major label again with a great new recording on a worthless format.  It may be compatible with non apple portable players 
 It is a shame that even though it was advertised, the hebrew text is missin 
 I decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it.  The metal is thin and flimsy, and the construction very poor (e.g., little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose).  Also, it was a bit lopsided, so it did not sit squarely on my counter.  Maybe it works fine.  Who knows.  The design and manufacture were so poor, I didn't keep it long enough to find out 
 This movie was obviously made by Japanese fans of several American films.  It then tried to mix them all together in one film.   The main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead.  Especially the Matrix.  We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.  Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.  Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.   The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.  I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.  As for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include.  The gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting.  Note that if you are looking for something different than typical American movies by checking out those wacky Japanese movies, you will not get it here 
 The China Moon cookbook offers many wonderful and unique recipes for lovers of asian cuisine. However, this book is definitely NOT for the cooking novice or for people that desire dishes that involves simple preparation. Most of the China Moon recipes requires the use of several different types of aromatic oils and spices that you need to make YOURSELF - which consists of several different types of ingredients that A) may be difficult to find in your local grocery store or B) needs to be prepared in some fashion before using. After spending hours/days/weeks chopping and cooking spices just to prepare special oil(s) (that you'll use only a couple of tablespoons worth), you'll think to yourself: 'Is this really worth it?'. Not only that, but the book insists that you make your own chicken/vegetable stock! And yet again, this involves combining several hundred different oils, spices and ingredients to make X amount of stock that you will only use 1 cup worth in a single recipe. Sheesh! After being discouraged by how much preparation and labor it involved to make a single dish (the 'simplest' dish calls for 2 oils)-I've only used my China Moon cookbook twice in the past 6 years. The dishes are impressive and tasty, but I would only recommend this book for people that really LOVE to cook or have alot of free time 
 i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit, but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting. The ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world.Dont even rent this, i dont even know why you are considering the film.  I only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since. 
 This book claims to be written in a large font, however the font is barely larger than the paperback edition.  The large print edition is at most 2 points larger than the paperback, maybe a 12 or 13 point font.  What makes this book bigger is the extra space at the bottom of the page which is not all that usefull for making notes.  This edition is poorly laid out for enjoyable reading and useful notation.  Don't waste you money to get this so called "large print" edition, you should probably just buy the regular sized one.  
 The best thing about this book for me was that it was so short.  I really don't think I could have finished if it were any longer.  I just don't get it.  I found the book to be so simple that it was insulting.  I felt like I should have read this at about 10 years of age.  Profound? Hardly. Masterpiece? Certainly not.  The only impact that this book had on me was trying to figure out what all the fuss was about... and I am still working on that one 
 This book deals with an interesting concept which is 'biomimicry'. In summary, it says that Mother Earth offers many models on which we can base our innovation/creation. But the book is not so easy to read and not so well planned. I skip many parts which in my sense go to deep in details and some parts are a bit repeatitive. The book is quite large but offers only few interesting ideas that are then developed and so detailed to an end which you don't remember the purpose. Some parts don't have a conclusion so you finish the chapter quite frustrated because you have read a big technical part and uoi don't see what was the point the author wanted to demonstrate. If you are interested in technical sciences then you might like it but otherwise, the ideas on biomimicry in this book could be summarize in a more compact book 
 Great! Karen Zelan writes a sensitive book about working with autistic children. Here's my rage and despair about this book. Zelan worked for years with Bruno Bettelheim. She co-authored books with him. And she witnessed his terrible abuse against mentally ill children at the Orthogenic School where she once worked. Many of the autistic children she knew lived at this school. Why did Zelan not report any of this abuse? Because of her silence and the silence of many others, young children, teens and young adults were constantly beaten and shamed in Bettelheim's "House of Horrors" for over 30 years. And children were beaten with fists and belts, smacked repeatedly in the face and told horrible things. It was all common knowledge if you worked there. So Karen Zelan cannot say she knew nothing of such things.  Read books like Richard Pollak's, "The Creation of Dr. B." or Stephen Eliot's, "Not the Thing I Was" or Jacqui Sanders' chapter on discipline in "A Greenhouse of the Mind", if you just can't believe it. Why should Zelan be allowed to benefit from writing this book about love and acceptance of autistic childen when she 1)did nothing to stop the abuse against autistic as well as mentally ill and traumatized children while she witnessed it and 2) has done nothing to make amends for her silence by now speaking out about the abuse and the legacy of silence.  How can she even live with such hypocrisy in her soul. Because of her silence and the silence of others, I was beaten and shamed for being confused and terrified. And I resent the hypocrisy of her being the sensitive autism guru when she seems to have had no problem watching disturbed children get beaten 
 I thought this video was disjointed and not oriented to any plot. Also the lighting was very dark and much of what was going on was unseeable 
 By my good fortune I happen to have had the pleasure of  working with Master Kwan, However briefly, in Boston last winter. Drawn to him by "The Wandering Taoist" I happened upon him in the Boston public garden, Teaching. After a couple of months, working together with his students and speaking with them about their experiences with him, I heard a few things that could be of use to the validity of Deng Ming-Dao's work. It turns out that when I once questioned Master Kwan's main student (of ten years) about Deng Ming-Dao's work, he said that he had met Deng Ming-Dao and was present while he was being tought. that said Master Kwan's student then stated that Ming-Dao was a  western man who had asked Master Kwan if he could write a book about him. Master Kwan agreed an told Ming-Dao a few stories and such. Afterwards Mister Ming-Dao proceeded to say that he had no further use for Master Kwan, and left.  To this day Master Kwan has never read any of the material published about him, nor has he recieved any kind of royalties from Mister Ming-Dao. That said, it must be understood that Master Kwan wouldn't trouble over such things as royalties, he leads a very humble life, but his students do find it frustrating. If you would like to see Mater Kwan for who he really is, I invite you to visit the site that I stumbled upon last winter at; www.easternheathpractices.org. I hate to slander anyone over such things but I feel very strongly about this. Thanks for your time and patience 
 There is absolutely no reason to buy this book unless required.  Homework is covered hardly at all, and the 'reviews' are meaningless 
 Really, I could write this book. I don't know why it has so many good reviews. The premise of the book is fantastic, but the book needed to be given to another writer. So many predictable and well-used novice symbolisms in this book. The characters aren't really likeable. The only reason I kept on reading was that I kept on waiting for the big climax. There was none. The ending was very poor. The beginning chapters went on and on and on...I wouldn't bother reading it. 
 The cover of this DVD states that the available sound tracks are DOlby Digital 5.1 English and Japanese, and English and Japanese Stereo.  Alas the sound is only in DTS for Japanese.  I do not have DTS, so trying to listen to it produces a loud pop, then no sound whatsoever.  Very disappointing, to say the least.  NOw I'm forced to watch with English, which I NEVER do with non-English material.  Boo, hiss 
 I liked Terry McMillan's "The Interruption of Everything", so I was really looking forward to reading this book- but it was one of the worst, most frustrating books I've ever read. First of all, the writing is on about a sixth-grade level. Example: "...Charles asked me if I wanted to dance. I said yes. So we danced. He danced like a man who was sure of himself. He watched me. I watched him. He smiled at me. I smiled at him." That's when I rolled my eyes and gave up. Unfortunately it was on page 365!! From then on I scanned the rest of the pages, just to satisfy my curiosity about what would happen to the rest of these characters. Secondly, most of the characters are complete morons, except for Gloria, who seemed real to me. (Working mom, single, trying to do the best for her son...) The other three jump into bed with EVERY man they meet, usually within the first three hours of meeting him. Then they whine and moan about how there are no good men out there. Well, DUH!!! Perhaps this is the point of the book, self-fufilling prophecy. I do like the title. It describes that feeling of waiting while what you want (husband, job, baby, etc.) hasn't happened yet. But this book was a disappointing waste of time. 
 I seriously suspect that people who gave 5 star reviews for this book work for the author or publisher. This book is nothing but a plug for his real estate courses. Believe me, buying this book will make the author, LeGrand, millionare not you 
 It's rare that I don't finish a book.  I realized after getting 1/3 of the way through it that I just couldn't get interested in the characters. Took it back to the library. A friend of mine who also reads a lot had the same experience. Harris' other books were much better 
 The movie was well filmed.  The plot and dialogue while possibly accurate was dull and boring.  One of the worst war movies I have seen.  I own it but not for long 
 Had I read the reviews more critically, I would never have bought this book. From these reviews it is clear that Ms. Devi has popularized yoga, and in so doing, has trivialized yoga. Her earthy-crunchy, anecdotal babbling throughout the book makes this an excruciating read. I have never written a negative review of a book, but this book is an abomination 
 Isn't this illegal or something?  To write a mystery (or anything for that matter) that simply has no ending? I don't think I've ever encountered anything quite like this before!  It's not that it's left up to the reader's imagination or anything like that.  The book just ends! No resolution of any kind.  Like there were pages torn out! Even if a story is to be continued in the next book of a series, fine but there has to be some explanation for the characters' actions and some kind of ending in order for the reader to be encouraged to come back for the rest of the story.  I actually quite enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book and assumed, stupidly I guess, that the author would pretty much tie things up so it was such a disappointment and actually downright insulting to find that the author simply doesn't care in the least about her readers. At the very least, the author and the reader have a silent understanding that the reader will be willing to excuse some errors or idiosyncratic writing or loose ends so long as the author provides the reader with a work that is sincere, entertaining and professional. I did my part. I paid my 10 bucks for the book, I read it until the very end and then the author let me down.  Not just because I didn't like the ending.  But because the author showed such disrespect for me, the reader, that she didn't even bother with an ending! I will never read another of Ms. Grimes books ever again.  What a cheat 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I was forced to suffer through this rubbish in a college class. This book is merely propaganda packaged under a thin dust jacket of objectivity. The arguments are weak and contrived. Said seems to be just another appologetic for Islamic barbarism. The very premise for the book seems irrelevant -unfair potrayal of Islam in the western press. It's the very typical "don't believe what you see, believe what I say" sort of drivel that only appeals to mindless drones in dusty lands 
 Even for $6.88 at Sam's Club, this Millennium Collection CD was no bargain.  It's so bad I couldn't even finish listening to it!  Where did they get these cuts?  They sound so muddy and poorly mixed that they must have been practice session tapes retrieved from the dumpster.  The various instruments and voices keep fading in & out so you can't follow the music.  Plus, the tempos and overall sounds are very different from the "definitive" versions most of us think of. I never thought it was possible to mess up a Clapton song, but UMI proved me wrong.  And the liner notes? --None in this cardboard packaged "green" version 
 ...so S T O P; don't buy this book.  It's Junk.  Anyone who's been in the  profession a while knows it because many of us received it as a Designer's  Book Club intro title in the late 80's or early 90's.  It wasn't worth the  cost of its S&H!  Ask around to people in the profession and look it  over first.   I received mine while having just a few years of experience  in practice.  Initally excited and impressed with myself having identifed a  clear technical error, my feelings quickly changed to surprise and then  anger as I began to realize the whole book was packed w/ errors and  critical omissions.  It was generally a frustratingly incompetent  presentation with widely incomplete information on its proposed subjects.  That the editors and publisher let this trash out, and were, I presume,  making their livings with this level of incompetence was disheartening 
 I need a copy of this story for my 4 year old daughter to stress the fact that she shouldn't cry unless something is truly wrong.  In doing my due diligence and trying to see how this book appeared on the inside I found that although text will appear no full illustrations will show.  Ergo I have no idea whether or not this book will be effective.  Needless to say I'm buying another version.  Shame on Pied Piper Paperbacks for not allowing parents to screen thei material for appropriatness 
 Maybe I am just naughty, but there is really nothing new here.  I could have written a better book.  On the other hand, it was nice to see that I know what I am doing without having to read it in a book.  :)  I guess if you have no passion and no animal instint, get the book.  
 I am a person responsible for creating several orginal books, created out of nothing, adding to the public good, inspiring many, creating all kinds of jobs. I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE with this Professor, another communist loosing himself and his ideas on our society. Why should my creation be at some point given away free to who, other publishers who can then publish it and make ALL the money. THERE is no such thing as FREE in this world, expect apparantly to overly idealistic Professors who do not live in the real world. Instead of only lengthening the term of Copyright for twenty years and then giving my creation away, they should let me and my family own it forever. Of course if this Prof actually created something that really connected with society and sold for decades I wonder who he would want to keep any earnings it might make. When is the BIG SCHOOL MONOPOLY with all their pie in the sky professors going to stop blaming BIG BUSINESS for all societies evils when in this case my copyright is all I have to support my family. I suppose the next book this nitwit will write will be about how all property owners and home owners should not own their homes and property but they should be open and useable and `owned' by all.   
 I've always enjoyed Sara Paretsky's novels, despite the left-wing preaching. In the past this has been subordinated to character & plot. But not here. There's not much plot -- a few elements here & there -- & it never really drives the story. Far too much space is given to the standard left-wing caricature of the rich & the repetitive, boring stereotyping of 'family values' as just so much plutocratic hypocrisy. Ms Paretsky, we _know_ you hate the American rich, & they're probably as hideous as you paint them to be. But here they're just cardboard cut-out characters. And of course the book is just a long, boring wait to see just how the filthy rich committed the crime & how they'll get away with it. Plus the satisfying way in which the horrible rich are (once again) forced to cough up the money they at first (of course) refused to give. This is getting tedious. 
 One has to admire the career of cult director Joe D'Amato. He's made everything from action, drama, comedy, westerns, horror and even porn. And porn/horror.  According to the IMDb Joe D'Amato has 198 films credited as director and with all the names he used I wouldn't be surprised if he had more.  Anthropophagus: The Grim Reaper was directed by Joe D'Amato and written by and starring cult actor George Eastman.  The Grim Reaper has become quite infamous for the gore scenes and in particular the fetus ripping scene, all which I will touch upon later on.  Fans are in the middle on this one. Some see it as slow and boring, others as a really scary flick.  I normally like movies like this that move at a slow pace, but this time it just didn't work.  The slow pace worked great in D'Amato's Beyond the Darkness. The movie was weird and disturbing and that is what kept it from being boring. But here things in my opinion didn't work as well.  The first hour is painfully boring. What Joe D'Amato was aiming for was a feeling of dread, which just didn't seem to work like it did in Beyond the Darkness.  The characters also were quite boring. Had they been interesting than maybe what D'Amato was going for would have worked. The cast though is excellent.  Serena Grandi who is known as the Italian Dolly Parton is one of the stars as I mentioned George Eastman (this guy is great). And Tisa Farrow, yes Mia Farrow's sister.  But 3 good actors still doesn't make this movie rise above. Had the characters been good well I think what Joe D. was going for would have worked better.  As for the gore it's really not that much, the final gore scene is quite graphic, but the rest wasn't much.  The late 70s the gore films really began and the 80s it blew up and Italy capitalized on that. But The Grim Reaper really isn't the gore movie it's made out to be and even the fetus-ripping scene isn't a big deal like it's made out to.  That's not something we see a lot of in film so I understand why people talk about it.  I just never felt the dread D'Amato was going for. Eastman like always is great, but really not used to his potential. The guy is 6'9! But he wasn't as intimidating as he should have been.  Fans of Italian cinema and of Joe D'Amato might wanna check this out. Despite my feelings I understand why some love it.   I felt the tension built up didn't work, but if you watch it and think it does this movie will deliver.  Regardless of how I felt I'm still a fan of Joe D'Amato and will always buy his flicks. 
 How can you write a new biography about the Virgin Mary when you have only the gospels? Lesley Hazelton's solution is to use anthropological and historical information to fill the background. Starting off with the basic facts about being a first century Jewish peasant, she uses information about Galilee, being a healer, pregnancy and childbirth, first century polytheism, and nasty details about crucifixion. In her view Mary, or Maryam, was pregnant at thirteen. She was probably a healer who taught her son. She certainly would have assisted the rebellion that broke out on the death of Herod the Great in 4 BCE. She may have been raped, possibly by a solider, possibly by priests. Notwithstanding that traumatic event, she was "a strong woman of ability and wisdom who actively chose her role in history, and lived it to the fullest." Now a reader might look at Hazleton's rather sparse notes, and note some scholarship, but a closer look would reveal that never gives page numbers. In fact this is simply a reverse of the old devotional lives. Where they portrayed Mary as an exemplar of Christian dogma, she portrays her as a New Age hero. Both do violence to the real Jewish Mary.    One of Hazleton's flaws is anachronism of evidence. She relies on a mid-century history of Palestinian peasant life, and then assumes that there were no changes in the intervening nineteen centuries. She uses Barbara Ehrenreich's deeply flawed book on medieval midwives to argue that Mary would have been a healer. Even if women were healers at that time, it does not follow that Mary would be one of them. She uses information from the Intafada to argue that Mary would have supported the rebellion on Herod's death. (Later still she argues, against the evidence of both Matthew and Luke, that Jesus was actually born ten years after Herod's death, which means that Mary would have been 2 at the time of the rebellion.) There are other examples of Hazleton's shallow grasp of Palestinian history. Contrary to what she says, there is some evidence of synagogues at the time in Galilee. Herod the Great would not have thought about declaring himself a divinity, since he was actually Jewish. Palestine was not of strategic value because it was part of the Grain land route from Egypt to Rome; grain would have been shipped entirely by sea. Contrary to what Hazleton says, Galileans in the Roman era were not descended from the old Israeli monarchy. They were fervently Jewish who probably descended from settlers in the second century.     These errors allow Hazleton to make the preposterous claim that Mary was a Goddess worshipper, and even said prayers to Isis! There is no evidence to support such a suggestion. Josephus refers to the Galilean's devotion, and the archaeological evidence clearly shows that there was no major Gentile presence at this time. Exclusive monotheism is one of the clearest and best attested ideas of first century Judaism. There is certainly no evidence that Mary would have been aware of the esoteric, much later, gnostic speculation that Hazleton (of course) links her to. But then Hazleton's ideas about religion are pretty sentimental. She has John the Baptist believe "that God was inside you, not in a temple," an idea that was "an early manifestation of the democratic spirit." In point of fact John clearly argued that the world faced imminent judgement for its sins. Hazleton may prefer the cosmopolitan and tolerant virtues of paganism, but they have nothing to do with Mary. One should add that the book in infected with purple prose about fertility and Mary's grief over the crucifixion. One should note that Hazleton talks about things that she has no way of knowing, such as saying there was no "romance" in first century Palestine, or what age girls were married at, or how many children they were likely to have, or what Mary's grandmother was like. There are also several pages where Hazleton tries to have it both ways on Mary's sexuality. Obviously Mary isn't drearily celibate, but on the other hand it would be crudely rationalist to deny her virginity.     The simplest explanation is also the most reasonable. There is no evidence that Mary was a Christian, only that she survived the death of her son. Both Paul and the Gospels clearly state that Jesus had siblings. To say that they were merely cousins or kinsmen is simply gratuitous assertion, which can be gratuitously denied. Christian dogma denied Mary her family and her religion because it undercut the doctrine of perpetual virginity and, more important, the Incarnation. Hazleton does the same thing, but claims that this is an act of empowerment. Readers should not be similarly deluded 
 The Christian idea of Dominionism has been around since the founding of America. In the eyes of non-objective christians everywhere they see modernity as a threat and would be more than satisfied to turn back the dial of time back to the 1950's - quaint white suburbs of jesus praisin' and boredom. They feel that they have a divine duty to take control over the government to punish our naughty behaviors of gay marriage, pot smoking, and internet porn.  Somehow they link the downfalls of modern setbacks to our moral behavior. Any rational thinking person knows that this is ludacris. What about the morals and values of George W. Bush's war mongering? What about the morals and values of priests who rape children physically and mentally? What about the morals and values of putting away a father in jail, from his children, because he enjoys smoking marijuana casually?   Francis Schaeffer attemps to explain why morality and freedom have crumbled in our society. His solution is ironically to restrict freedom by reverting to the very virus that gave us the Crusades and the Inquisition - accepting the bible as truth and accepting Jesus as your savior.  Jesus died for his own sins not mine.  I was unfortunately raised as a Christian Catholic and it took me until I got into college to undo this henious mind virus.  Luckily I'm sure this county will never subscibe to this "Protocols of the Christian Elders" horsesh*t 
 First off, I wanted to rate this DVD higher.  I love the Rugrats and I really want the creators to keep making more specials!  The first "Tales" movie was pretty good.  But the truth is, "Three Jacks" wasn't so great.  I don't know... I guess I expected a better Rugrats movie, especially since it was delayed for so long.  This film skews to an even younger audience than the TV show.  Honestly, I felt like this one was made for the Nick Jr. crowd...  Some negative points: * There are NO grown-ups in this movie (they were present in Snow White, so what gives?). * Spike the dog is not here either (but Fluffy is). * The cow character, Aunt Moo, was made the star of this movie... She is given too much screen time, way more than Angelica and Harold.  This is my biggest complaint. * Susie sings at the end... a la "All Grown Up". * Polka music (we also learn that Phil hates polkas). * Dil still makes many 'poopie' remarks.  On the plus side: * Phil cracks plenty of jokes. * Angelica really makes a great evil giant.  She even has her "All Grown Up" music. * The film is pretty long, and has 2 bonus episodes.  If you have a young kid, he or she will definitely enjoy the movie.  If you must buy a "Tales" DVD, "Snow White" is the better of the two.  On an end note, I hope this poor movie is not the swan song for Rugrats 
 I have been a fan of Peter Carey forever and have read all his work. His work, however,has become more bizare and unreadable with each new book. Weird characters  and a brilliant command of the language have always been a part of his style,Some of his stuff almost crossed the line (My Life as a Fake) to the inintelligible but Theft makes it all the way. I found the characters somewhat boring, and the language, idioms, references to times and places impossible to understand in many cases. Perhaps if you are a Sydneysider or live somwhere else in that great and beautiful country the book will make some sense. But for the rest of us---I am really sorry to report the book is not readable. I quit after reading about 2/3ds and for me that is unheard of. I feel like I have lost at good friend 
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, US Defense Contractors were also on the verge of collapse, that is until someone had the bright idea of privatizing the government. Current government privatization efforts have resulted in huge contracts costing the American taxpayer double and triple the cost of the original government employees. This book is a Conservative Pipe Dream, a guide to a fantasy bureaucracy that never existed, and a bomb that has totally disrupted the efficient operation and security of the Federal Government 
 I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned:  1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3) Drop the "my life sucks" and "everyone hates me" tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are done  Anyone want to buy a used CD 
 I've been to Belgiun and The Netherlands many times.  Here are my reviews of the best guides to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.  Frommer's These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the public transportation system.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide   
 If you are beginning CMOS analog design,please dont use this.There is very brief theory to supplement and equally insufficient physical explanations;maybe for an experienced industry guy this sort of approach works well,but in all this is not the text to follow.It has obvious advantages since a website with solutions is devoted to the text but that in no way compensates for the poor quality of material-it is very difficult to develop physical understanding out of this book.Maybe using Alan Gerbene's text (MOS Analog Design)alongside this book will help,I adopted this approach and it helped 
 At first it kind of sounds good, but then track 2 starts and it has the same piano riff and the same thing with all of the tracks. After a while it is hard to tell whether you are listening to a different song, or if track 3 is a reprise of tracks 1 and 2. I guess if you like it then you will like the whole thing, because the whole album sounds like a comp on the same jam. 
 This terrible unit damaged may carpeting. Even though I had placed it in a tray, still a half gallon water was leaked on my carpet 
 My original review was too polite and defied the truth regarding this book.  Honestly, it is not worth the money, barely deals with the subject matter at all and when it does, it is vague and amateurish.  I was so disappointed in this book that I returned it.  I really do love Ms. Oelke's paintings.  I only wish she had written a book about her work, her style and her techniques instead of trying to hit EVERY aspect of equine art! As a result of this "crazy quilt" attempt at writing, Ms. Oelke has managed to embarrass herself.  I hope the next book is REALLY about how to paint horses and ONLY about that 
 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
 these guys are mediocre at best. There is a flash of real grooviness here or virtuosity there, but their sound has no backbone. Not at all at the same level with the best music of that era. . . Airplane, Doors, Hendrix, etc. . . It's just your average fuzzy BritTwittery. If you're looking for something similarly dated and far more mindblowing, I would advise you to save your money and purchase a good performance of Debussy Images et Estamps, or perhaps Ravel Ondine 
 The disapearance of USSR was terrible for Tom Clancy - it deprived Jack Ryan of real evil enemy so the author had to invent some new ones. After going through the Japanese and the Arabs he couldn't find nothing better than... vegetarians!!!  This whole book is a pathetic joke! Good Lord, when I think that once I actually DIDN't sleep for 48 hours because I couldn't stop reading "The Cardinal of Kremlin". Mr Clancy Sir  you were so great in the past - what happened? Now every next of your books is simply worse than the previous... And just to be clear - politically I am as much on the right (Republican) side than you, so this is not just the hostility of a political enemy but a sincere disappointment of a former fan Could you try to write something good once more? In memory of good old times? Please? 
 The replacement stylus is terrible, much lower quality than the original stylus that comes with the LD.  The replacement telescoping top is too loose, and thus wiggles around a lot in your hand.  And it doesn't extend and retract smoothly into the barrel.  I would rather get a stock LD stylus than get 3 of these replacements 
 I used to say that I'd buy anything by TFF, without a listen.  Sorry to say, I should have listened to this one, first.  It's a collection of cuts that never made it to a recording until TFF disbanded, and there's a reason these never made it to a recording:  they're largely unlistenable.  Save your money 
 Having worked in the mental health community for sometime, I was already familiar with this technique and have been using it already.  I felt the book was really droll and somewhat condescending in tone.  I wouldn't purchase it again.  His companion book "Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed to Do and What to Do about It" is a more practical read and enjoyable too--I would recommend that one 
 Interesting speculation of potential future events.  Some are way out such as the prediction of a major asteroid hit.  Others are likely, such as his note that nuclear energy will likely return in response to global warming fears.  What spoiled it for me was his calling the US a "rogue superpower".  He clearly understands we were attacked on 9/11 and notes that Al Qaeda is a "rogue enemy", but does not believe we have the right to protect ourselves by taking the war overseas to our enemy.  His first book, "Art of the Long View" was more informative 
 Trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether I like it or not (and if I like it, there most certainly is not a 'bitter' end), I gave up on this one literally halfway through.  Part of me wanted to finish it because I had gotten so far into it, but I gave up and said 'enough.'  This book has so many elements repeating from many other Koontz books, thus it felt like a retread.  I did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger.  I wasn't impressed by his perfect, adorable wife and children, or his career as an author of horror fiction.  And the afterword by the author seemed smug.  I'm sorry I read so much of it before I stopped, but better late than never 
 Another disappointing Stephen King miniseries.  For some reason, lately I've been rewatching some of the older Stephen King miniseries that I hadn't seen since they originally aired.  Maybe I thought they'd be better without all the commercials to drag them on and on.  The cream of the crop is THE STAND.  The dregs is THE LANGOLIERS, with the worst special effects ever...Ed Wood would have been proud.  TOMMYKNOCKERS falls somewhere between.  Basically it tells the story of how one lady (Marg Helgenberger) stumbles across a mysterious little object in the woods, and is compelled to unearth it.  Turns out its some sort of alien craft with the power to exert its "will" on the people of the little Maine town nearby.  These people undergo gradual (or not so gradual) personality changes which allows them to "suddenly" invent impossible machines, read each others minds, and also to gleefully kill anyone who seeks to thwart them.  That's all well and good.  Sounds like it could be good, clean, gory fun.  Certainly, the book it's based on was.  I know that King himself is not terribly fond of the book, mostly because he wrote it during the height of his drug and alcohol additions...but it contained some of his most disturbing scenes too, and a believable, ultimately heartbreaking romance between the two leads.  I have always liked it myself.  (To me, King's nadir was THE DARK HALF.)  Back to the "movie."  Jimmy Smits plays Helgenberger's boyfriend, a formerly successful poet now awash in alcoholism...but trying to climb out of his hole.  He's immune to the power of The Tommyknockers because of a steel plate in his head, but goes along for the ride for much of the story because of the guilt he feels over his own behavior.  Eventually, things get bad enough that he finally musters up the courage to take matters into his own hands...with rather serious consequences for himself.    But the story is told in a plodding manner.  For every compelling scene (for example, early on Smits is at a reception where he's been drinking too much, and has a gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment) there's two clunkers (Cliff De Young and Traci Lords as two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky in the sorting room!!)  Helgenberger and Smits are fine, as are Joanna Cassidy as the local sheriff and E.G. Marshall as a kindly curmudgeon.    But the lengthy novel has been condensed so awkwardly, and the subplot with DeYoung and Lords given FAR, FAR too much time on screen (De Young is one of the worst actors EVER to get more than one role) to keep make even the gamest performances worthwhile.  I guess the producers were so tickled to have former porn star Lords on their set, they just couldn't help coming up with more ridiculous things for her to do.  Also, we are forced to see how far Robert Carradine (so good as the "head nerd" in REVENGE OF THE NERDS all those years ago) has fallen...he turns in a perfectly dreadful performance.  The special effects and makeup are quite cheesy.  But many things could have been forgiven had a decent adaptation been managed.  But THE TOMMYKNOCKERS was doomed from the start with a pitiful script, not helped by uninspired direction.  If you're a big fan of Smits, Cassidy or Helgenberger, I guess you might want to take a gander.  If you're a fan of Stephen King or horror/sci-fi...stay away! 
 I received this coffeemaker for Christmas.  After two months of use, it quit working. I contacted Hamilton Beach and they sent me something to clean my coffeemaker.  It still did not work so I contacted Hamilton Beach again.  Now I have to cut off my appliance cord and send it back to them along with $6 to get a new cord.  Since it wasn't my fault, why should it cost me anything to get my coffeemaker restored.  Stay away from Hamilton Beach products 
 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 There appear to be several versions of this movie floating around. There is an "unrated" version and a "directors cut". I know there is a "directors cut" on VHS but I don't think a DVD version has been released yet. The DVD "unrated" is a bit cleaner then the directors cut in that scenes are shortened and things have been trimmed down. If you saw this movie on t.v. as I did then you saw the directors cut and will probably be very disapointed in the other version(s) as quite a bit is taken out. Its noticeable how much is taken out after seeing two different versions of this movie. One version looks PG 14ish with so much having been taken out and seeing a censored version of a movie with simulated action is kinda pointless.   To be clear and to try and help someone avoid being disapointed, as I was, if you really liked this movie on t.v. or saw it on video you probably saw the directors cut and may want to check carefully which version you are getting when you order it. I am not sure the directors cut has come out on DVD yet I only know the copy of the DVD I got when I ordered is way different (a lot toned down) from the vhs directors cut version I got a couple years ago.  I gave this product one star. If it had been the directors cut version brought out on DVD like I thought it was then it would have got a lot higher 
 I read most of the book last night and was disturbed by several things - The author deliberately blurs the line between "Arab" and "Muslim." He calls non-Arabs "whites," and makes whites sound like low class, trailer trash, uneducated red necks. Aren't Arabs white? I was offended that he mentioned Danny Thomas as an example of all the fine Arab people who have come to US to find a better life. Yes, Danny Thomas was Arab, but not a Muslim. Maharidge quotes an Arab comedian as saying that there's so much discrimination against Arabs. But unless they point out that they are an Arab, how would one even know? How can you treat someone different, unless they point out how different they are?   I have personal involvement in two of the stories quoted in the book, and know that facts presented are incorrect. I think it's grossly incompetent and irresponsible for an author to present a work of nonfiction without verifying his information.  Knowing that some of the facts are wrong, I would look at the rest of the book with reservation. Maharidge treats those he perceives to be the underdog with sympathy, but paints those who speak against them as ignorant, uneducated bigots.  Maharidge's premise that contemporary America dangerously resembles the Weimar Republic, or "Heimat," that led to Nazi Germany is an oversimplification of the current government of the US.  This proposition is deliberately anti-administration, inflamatory, and a grab for publicity. 
 I bought this product because of positive member reviews and and outstanding review in CNet. However, I just bought a new Dell Inspiron E1505 that shipped with Windows Vista Home Premium, and ZoneAlarm 6.5 is flat out incompatible with the new OS. I downloaded ZoneAlarm 7.0 and that is flat out incompatible as well. I'm sure this is a great Security Suite for Windows XP, but beware if you have Vista. There seems to be no update on their website when Zonelabs will release a Vista compatible ZoneAlarm. (They mention something about "after January 2007", but it's March, for crying out loud!) So there's my purchase price of a good product down the drain 
 this recording is NOT comparable to JRB's "Songs For a New World."  The accompaniments are nowhere as interesting and the lyrics/storytelling, along with the endless melodies, are nothing short of cloying.  As for the reviewer who mentioned that Mr. Bucchino is an up and coming B'way composer, it must be noted that he has NOT had a show on B'way and many of these tunes are recycled from many years past.  A cabaret artist maybe, but this endless ballad style would never make it past the public at larg

Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 Perhaps it was because I have yet to read Voltaire's Candide, but Southern's Candy was completely lost on me.  There was enough perversity and bizarreness to keep me reading until the end but I was left feeling that it was a bit incomplete and a bit pointless.  Nevertheless, I get the feeling that Southern is a talented writer, and perhaps this just wasn't one of his better works 
 I would have saved more time if I had read the reviews first, thanks for the help finding that one song I wanted! verve remix  
 This book did not even have any application exercises. I expected following each chapter some exercises or affirmations I could use to turn my life around and have someone tap me on the shoulder for a job interview. I thought this book book was aimed at the general psychiatrist instead of the average layman. I would of liked to see a suggestion in this book to keep a journal.   For this book keep, your money in your wallet. It is not even worth $13.00 plus tax. Show me how to improve my bottom line income and you got my interest 
 I love the music on this DVD.  It's wonderful to hear many of John's best solo works in 5.1 surround; BUT that's where the praise for this release ends.  While some of the video is inoffensive, most of it is simply political and personal Ono promotional propaganda.  I felt as it she was in the room picking my pocket.  And what she did to the "Happy Christmas" video is a crime!  I'll never be able to listen to it again without images of dead babies coming to mind.  Yes, Lennon was a peace activist. I get it!  But give it a rest Yoko.  My advice is to either pass on this DVD (and buy the CD) or turn the cr@ppy video off while listening to the beautiful 5.1 mix 
 I have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best.  Only problem is that they RUST!!!  I had mine a few weeks when I noticed the rust spots on the interior.  I don't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot, so it must have happened simply because I leave water in my tea kettle at all times.  The directions that come with this kettle say not to do so, but any serious tea drinker like me knows that's unrealistic.  I threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money didn't last long at all.  I thought Le Creuset was supposed to be really high quality but I'm officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot 
 The cover and overviews make reference to Glasser's book being supported by facts.  So, I was looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, it is short on facts and long on his opinions.    Such as where he states that "PERHAPS up to 50% of schizophrenics recover without medical help."  Perhaps???  That's a very glib statement supported by a "perhaps."    In one case where he cites a health statistic, it covers the period "from the 1930s to the 1990s" and is used to discredit medications.  His citing of such shows a disregard for evidence or his being terribly out of date in the medical field.  I suspect it is the latter.  Information from the 1930s and 40s and 50s??  That was the "dark ages" for most all medications, let alone for  psychiatric medications which have only begun to have treatment break throughs in the 1990s.   Referencing info from then is like saying "we proved in 1805 that mankind could not build airplanes that fly, so why don't people stop trying to build them."  A careful reading of what is written and how it is written seems to indicate that he has reached a foregone conclusion and is picking and choosing some evidence to support his opinion.  But mainly he uses argument and rhetoric to support it.  Don't bother with this book.  It's another one of those "I'm the only man in the world who knows anything, so buy my book. 
 No one dies, as they do in most Steele novels, but "Klone" is entertaining anyhow.  Recommend as an audio listen, not as a read 
 Hello,  This book has a unique setting but didn't interest me beyond the first few chapters.  Harris's book on Pompeii was much more interesting to me.  It had a lot of information about the culture and the technology of the Romans that was new and riviting.  Regards, Marti  
 At times our constitutional jurisprudence has fundamentally changed without a constitutional amendment.  Bruce Ackerman tries to expalin this.  He offers the theory of a constitutional moment that occurs when the public  makes it clear that it is time for a new constitutional way.  The problem  is that only Ackerman knows when that moment occurs. This arrogance does  violence to serious and meaningful constitutional interpretatio 
 This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great for some people, it just wasn't my thing.  
 This product is an absolute piece of junk. Do not buy this product. Will not even load properly onto computer. Have wasted several hours trying to install product on windows XP platform with no success. I have wasted a whole day trying to install this piece of junk on my computer, now I will probably waste another day trying to return this bunch of garbage to the vendor. 
 After reading this book I felt that I paid some good money for repetition, advertisement and teaching of how to get your company to send you to do some course work.  This is not what I was looking for 
 I've had an SC101 for almost a year.  When it works, it is SUPER.  When it doesn't, support is poor and you are really on your own.  I've had three different issues affecting data from three different machines accessing it over the past months.  None of the issues are discussed in the troubleshooting guide, nor in the FAQ, and email tech support has been completely unhelpful.  I've been able to salvage my data each time (yes, ultimately I had it backed up and could recover if needed), but the stability and support of the device makes it impossible for me to recommend it to anyone who feels they are an average home user.  (I am a fairly technical user and have never had this kind of trouble with a PC product. 
 I have always admired Chris Whitley and have seen him live several times.  But this CD...he must have owed someone some heavy money to put this thing out for sale.  Take a look at the photo on the cover.  It pretty much says it all.  It's like some sort of bizarre Disney ride, "You must be this high to like this album".  Sorry Chris, reload and try again 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 Don't Buy This CD For Any Reason Is a Piece of sweepings Only The Song "Tender" Could Be Listen and it`s Not The Big Deal. Don`t Waste Your Money And Your Time Please 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 This book has lots of nice photographs.  That is all.  The technical section consists of two pages which state that a waterproof membrane is needed between the roof structure and the soil.  There is no information of a technical nature in the book.  I wonder why use up the earth's resources for no value.  An absolute waste 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible however he does bring up some good points. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book entiteled "The Great Divorce" 
 I read the works of folks like Vince Flynn, Lee Child, and, I thought, Nelson DeMille, for the escape--the action--intrigue. Someting to make the plane flight go faster.  I don't read for thinly-veiled, current-events, quasi-political commentary.  (There are recognized exports available for that sort of thing.  For example, a tour-of-duty in Vietnam gives neither me, nor Nelson, "expert" status on the conduct of warfare.)  DeMille, as he matures as a person and a writer, has taken to slipping his "agenda" into his storytelling.  Consequently, the "story telling" aspect of his craft has, in my opinion, atrophied.  He, of course, has that right. But I, for one, am done reading his books. There's always the news if I want current events commentary. And better suspense writers if I desire an entertaining escape.     
 This book never finds its plot, and like a sitcom passed its prime, jumps the shark repeatedly in an effort to distract the reader from this potboiler drivel and at the same inject forward motion into the book. This might be one of the worst books I have ever read. Which is really too bad, because the premise- women with their own language and bond- is very promising 
 The only truth he told was in the front of the original (1830) ed of the Book of Mormon. He lists himself (correctly) as the author and proprietor of the work. Later editions claim his as a translator -- just like he translated the Kinderhook plates.  This "most correct book" contains numerous spelling errors and grammatical errors. Elohim's spell checker must have been off line when Joe was writing this one 
 With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience 
 I can't discard these songs completely, because they have such potential! Clever, fun lyrics, great beat, but BOY I wish this guy could hit his notes more often!  I suppose this fellow requires the sort of "pitch doesn't matter" mindset that Grateful Dead listeners perfected years ago (or similar drugs). I'm just not that tolerant or substance affected 
 I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was first published back in 1968. I'm not a Peters expert, but this must be one of her very early works, before she honed her craft. It is short and would be even shorter if it didn't fall back on annoying misunderstandings among the characters to maintain the tension. I didn't find the characters to be appealing, and the book lacks the wit and verve of her later works. Personally, I don't think this measures up to the Peabody books, although I notice several other reviewers differ. What can I say? I'm right and they're wrong, naturally 
 Once again, Koch, for reasons that I cannot possibly fathom, assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes. I know I'm feeling large amounts of gratitude. It's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone, right?  At least the copy I bought was used, so Koch didn't make a dime off of me. Anyway, this is another Koch release that you should definitely avoid 
 The journal questions are redundant and most people in the group I'm leading don't like it.    
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 The cover of this album describes it as 'Leave-taking from the British Folk revival 1970-1977' and that was indeed a period worth commemorating.  This collection, sadly, does not do it justice.  There are only 13 tracks (and only 9 artists, as 4 of them appear twice) and what there is in no way represents the best of the period.  The Watersons were a great group, but Lal Waterson, singing solo on two of these tracks, is painfully out of tune.  The other performers on this album are fine, and are well worth a listen, but you will find them all better represented on other albums.  I realize that this selection is restricted to recordings from the Trailer label, but I cannot believe this is the best they could do.  Both quality and quantity are lacking.  A sad leave-taking indeed.  
 Reading this book, I got a picture of a certain kind of person who would love this book. Unfortunately, this kind of person is not me! I was disappointed. But if you find ideas like these useful you will also like One Thing at a Time: # 31  Keep a phone log # 68. Label a cardboard box "office supplies" and put all your office supplies in it so you can find them. # 24. Sweep and vacuum at least once a week. # 61. Put things back, even when you're rushed. # 9.  Make your bed every day. # 72. Put a trash container in every room. Seems like these "tips" are things most everyone already knows. Don't they?  Other suggestions border on bizarre: #11. Make a list of mini-tasks like: sort mail, make a phone call, write a check, wipe up something that's spilled,  take out the trash, check a web site, etc. Why make a list when you could just do the work?  # 5. Carry a clip board because "A clipboard puts you squarely in charge of Things in your life." It does? #43. Create a list of items "almost anyone would throw away or recycle" including: used paper dishes, cups and napkins,  used tissues and toilet paper, empty cans, broken rubber bands, balls of hair, used dental floss, etc.!! Is the author joking?  If a person needs to make this list they also need much more help than this book can give!  I did find a few useful tried-and-true gems:  #1 One thing at a time.  #94 Leave it neater than you found it.  Finally, I recommend www.freecycle.org. Freecycle is an email list where people give away things that they no longer need for free. Give your stuff to a good home 
 You may find this to your liking, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I tried for a couple of hours to get into this, but I simply could not read it.   Not that it's hard to understand. Quite the contrary. But I found it precious, affected, and silly.  Not to mention self-indulgent. Other than that, though . . .  Sartwell defines beauty as "the object of longing." He tells us he is "less concerned to defend that as a definition than to use it as a basis for trying to find something common to certain kinds of human experiences and relations to things." Since we long for many things that are not beautiful, and commonalities between experiences and objects of longing may therefore have little to do with beauty, I find this approach less than promising.   And indeed, Sartwell stretches the idea of beauty beyond any normal meaning, and he makes it useless as a category of discernment. For instance, Picasso's Guernica is not-and is not supposed to be-beautiful. It's a horror, and in its horror lies its grandeur-it's supposed to horrify us. To call it beautiful because it illustrates the satisfaction of the longing for power is to corrupt the term "beauty" and miss the point of the artwork.  As for the self-indulgence, Sartwell has merely collected snippets of his reflections. He says this is "a book of moments, and can be dipped into rather than read straight through, though I also hope that the accumulation of moments displays a kind of structure that could yield a coherent set of experiences." Well, if you invite someone to dip into your moments, you'd better be a genius, if they are to find such visits worthwhile. Sartwell isn't. One wonders whether he didn't bother to use his many moments to generate a coherent set of thoughts because that task was beyond him, or because he just couldn't be bothered. Either way, Sartwell's belief that his fragments of reflection are worth our while betrays a self-confidence that the twenty-five pages or so I pondered do not justify.  And frankly, you have to puzzle over the perceptiveness of anyone anyone who refers to "the beauty of Jennifer Lopez" as "the skinniest common denominator of nubile beauty."  
 I'm at page 116 right now.  The writing is lovely, the specifics dense, and the sense of place rich.  If the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say, "I just can't go on with this story!" I'm going to throw the book at the wall.  Also, so many embarrassing little holes.  If I were a librarian I would say, "So Dracula's checked out.  Go to a bookstore.  Every bookstore in the country has a copy."  And if I were the cat, I would know I was a goner the second I appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph(you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you're going to fire it).  Lastly, it seems like Dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them.  Unless "Dracula" is related to our heroine--that would be good.  Will read a bit more. . . 
 The 2 stars is the average I give to all the fable books written by Patrick.   The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: 5 stars  Obviously, it is the best one. (you can see it from the sales record in Amazon). It was the first Patrick's book I read. I have finished reading the whole book in one setting and couldn't wait and jump to look for his other books. The book has a reasonable length, setting up a bit simplified, but not over-simplified, and still reasonable fable-like setting to illustrate all important team dysfunctions and team building skills. The whole book is tight and coherent and an easy but enlightening read. Highly recommended!    Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable 4 stars  It is a good one but not as great as the five team dysfunctions. A very good explanation of all kinds of meetings and how to use each of them. I recommend you buy one, read it and keep it as a reference. One drawback is the author tried to spicy up the book so one of the main characters will occassionally scream out some rude comments if he didn't take his pills. I never work with such an unusual person and I prefer less dramatic in a management fable. (not something like in "Desperate Housewife", the neighbor besides you was a serial killer and the housewife across the street did her gardener and used her Chinese maid to bear her baby.)   I should have stopped here and never rush to read his other books..    The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive: 2 stars  This is the one made me begin to feel betrayed. If the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within weeks. The fable setting needs more polishing works. Although the four obsessions have been presented with reasonable clariy, reading this book makes you feel that the author thinks you are an idiot. Scenarios like how the VP HR plots to damage the trust seem to be more suitable for a toddler fable rather than something for teenagers, not mentioning for managers. The rough plot affects the whole four points--though four very good points. I will recommend you to skim the whole book in less than 20 minutes by standing in a bookstore.    Five temptations of CEO 1 star?  It is the one makes me begin to feel angry. Again, if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within hours. The major story (95% of the book) happened in a dark train, where a poor CEO was taught about these five temptations by some ghost-like old men, who turned out later to be the previous CEOs in the SAME company! Again the five temptations are all great and worthwhile points. It is the plot that made me sick. If you have a chance, skim the whole book in less than FIVE minutes.   Silos, Politics and Turf Wars NEGATIVE 1 star  The worst one. Negative 1 star is because it wasted my time. I thought the five temptation one was the worst until I read this one. Patrick spends most of the book to illustrate the silo problems rather than provide any solution. And he even spends many pages about the main character's struggle in balancing his work and his wife's pregnancy, which I believe, should belong to another fable about personal life balance, given how many pages the author devoted to this. From other fables, more or less, you can at least learn something. But not from this one. Forget it!  
 I only wish I had not only the money back I spent on this book, but also the time I wasted reading it. A good book should inspire readers to think for themselves and form their own opinions on issues. All this book does is force feed the author's political leanings on the reader. Her spin on today's politics, in other words. Her view on today's issues is very naive and the story defies any sense of reality or belief. Don't waste your time or your money! 
 A real colorful and flashy bike, however there were several things wrong with it.  1. the tires had so much excess rubber, it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed.   2. The back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings. If not done, the bike would basically come to a stop by itself.   3. the main (front) sprocket is slightly bent, so the chain falls off constantly.   4. the bike if VERY heavy. maybe that makes it sturdy, but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride.  I should have just bought a bike off the floor at Wal-Mart or Target for half the price 
 I really enjoyed this book. Though slow at times, it was livened up with witty anectdotes and mature bathroom humor. The book describes the chemistry of everything from why your urine is yellow to how voodoo zombies actually occur. You will find out more than you wanted to know about everyday chemistry, and it might change your views on some things. The story of the namesake of the book describes the use of high density plastics to make radars work in airplanes, to build hula hoops, and high density plastic balls for pigs. 
 Wow.    Hollywood Symphony Orchestra MY BEHIND!!  This was the crappiest 4 bucks I've ever spent...  Immediately after reading the following from the back of the CD...  "Earth has been decimated by a meteor... The beautiful and capable Dr. Aki Ross is Earth's last hope against extinction.  This new recording, featuring the world-renowned Nobuo Uematsu, captures the excitement and drama of this popular videogame-turned blockbuster movie."  a few things... 1) to the right of the above paragraph was this message: "THIS RECORDING IS NEITHER SPONSORED OR ENDORSED BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS OR OWNERS." 2) The writer for the CD cover has clearly not ever played any of the FF games--he fails to notice that any of the FF games are continuations.   3) The FF film was not "a blockbuster movie".    Look, if you want to have better covers of Final Fanatsy music, scrounge around in  ocremix.org or vgmix.com  Amateurish digital instrumentation, completely craptastic.  I'd give it zero stars, but that wasn't an option.. 
 This book is infuriatingly opinionated; and Fadiman spends a lot of energy and space insulting great writers and saying stupid things. He seems more intent on placing his writers into a bogus hierarchy than actually appreciating them.  Many of his judgements are simply wrong 
 except for Ray of Light, which is one of the best pop songs of 90s, the Power of Goodbye, Beautiful Stranger and Deeper and Deeper. Where are the remixes of Don't Cry for me Argentina, or You Must Love Me or the remake of American Pie? The half of the album is full of silly ballads and R&B-scented numbers like the rubbish It's Human Nature, the sleep-inducing (but mean to be a good ballad) Take A Bow which is the same with all Babyface songs, Bedtime Story which is the same as ever with anything Bjork has done in the past and so-so Secret. Frozen seems to be a nice standout but it doesn't feel sincere, and more or less sounds like Power of Goodbye... and the Music album was one of the worst albums Madonna crapped out so singles should not be different.  All in all, Madonna is not a slow number singer; her voice terribly sounds weaker than her dance numbers and that's why this greatest hits album was not successful as Immaculate Collection because the singles were already bad. This album reflects the spiral-down of Madonna through 90s to 2000s (except Ray of Light where she struck gold) where she hit the bottom with American Life and has not recovered herself. Go buy Immaculate Collection, Ray of Light album, down load one or two other songs at your disposal and you will have the good things Madonna has produced among the heap of redundant mass called pop music. 
 I just purchased the 2 disc, special edition of this movie, and here's my problem(s):  First off, I don't speak Italian, so my only options are to watch the film with the English dub, or with the Italian dub with the English subtitles, but here's the problem; the English dub is out of sync with the film, sometimes being only slightly so, but other times being very noticeable and distracting (i.e. during loud sound effects, such as a chair being knocked over, or someone knocking loudly on a door).  And so my other option is the Italian bud with the English subs, but here's the problem with this, the English subs are missing during the scene where Peggy is reading the diary (about 30+ minutes into the movie).  Now, I had noticed missing subs during the first part of the film, but these where usually during background conversations, or occasionally a line would be missing from someone's speech, but could usually be figured out, and these where only slightly annoying, but the missing subs for the diary entry is inexcusable (and is also missing from the other subs as well) as this is an important bit of info to the plot of the story.  Also, when you set up the audio option, from the main menu, there's no problem, but I found that if you use the audio button on your DVD remote, the Italian option gives you the French soundtrack and the French gives you the Italian one. It's nothing serious, but it's an annoyance all the same.  So, does anyone else notice these problems, or did I just end up with a bum disc 
 The content is full of valuable information on selling. But this Audio CD is not my favourite.   Ziglar speaks so rapidly and non-stop! I guess nobody speaks in this mannner.  I mean, if you want listeners to enjoy your speech, it is better to  speak in a more natural pace, occassionally there should be a pause.    Ziglar is rushing the scripts when you listen to this CD. Choking the brain of the listeners with no respite whatsoever! Slow down Slow down......... Ziglar!  Give me some space to absorb your message!   I wish I can listen to your CD comfortably, but I can't.  You Read the scripts in such a rapid manner that it does not help your listeners to relax and enjoy your works. Ziglar!   I am sorry, I have to give you 2 stars based on your unsatisfactory presentation in this CD 
 I found this book to be a lot of common sense without a lot of fresh ideas. The author is from Indiana and constantly sites examples from that part of the country which didn't help me at all. The constant plugs to hire  a bridal consultant become tiresome. I wouldn't recommend this book unless  you didn't have a clue about the wedding process 
 This Is as Bad as The Film.in Fact Just Like The FIlm The Soundtrack is the same old Formula.Will&His Movies&Music Never change the same Old Beat.The Rest Of The Soundtrack is just as  bad.UNORIGINAL&BORING.What A Waste of KOOL MOE DEE 
 i don't know, fool for the city is the only one you need from foghat because it has the longer 8 minute version of the song slow ride! this is just a waste of my time. 
 On my previous trip to Australia in 2001, I used the Let's Go travel guide.  It was okay, but after the excellent book I had for Hawaii, I thought I would try for something better.  Frommer's isn't it.  This book has no more information than the website and is probably not as up to date.  Hours and prices were consistently wrong--by more than allowable for a yearly update.  Attraction ratings were unhelpful.  That is, they did not include the sort of information that helped me decide what I wanted to see.  For example, a museum in Adelaide is supposedly known for it's extensive collection of Aborigine artifacts and was highly rated based on that.  However, the items are presented with minimal context, so that the collection is not the tremendous learning experience it ought to be; it's more like an art show.  Another example:  The botanical garden in Melbourne is like a park, with few flowers; the one in Brisbane is organized like a zoo, divided into geographic regions, and with lots of flowers.  The distinction wasn't made in the book.  Australia is a huge area to cover, but this book tries to please too many audiences and ends up satisfying none, I would think.  By including dining and lodging choices from 5 star to 2 star, it can only offer 3 or 4 choices in each category.  A huge failing was not identifying where the best areas to stay are, based on what you want to do.  For example, if you will be taking lots of bus tours, you want to stay at a hotel where the buses will pick you up.  If you are renting a car, you will want to stay somewhere with free or inexpensive parking and from which you can easily go into or out of town.  It would have been far more helpful to list good/reliable Aussie chains/organizations of hotels/motels/b&bs than to list individual establishments.   I didn't even like the way the book was organized.  The attractions are why I travel--things to see and do.  They were listed after lodging and food and given just as skimpy treatment. I would have done better to stick with my OLD Let's Go book from 2000 
 First of all, 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks.  Second of all, I missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain.  Also, regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises, it is still moderately difficult 
 the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over, and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested, defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place.  I would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected.  
 If you're thinking of buying this book in preparation for comedy improv classes, you're off track.  You'll learn in the first weeks of your class that you discover what your scene's about as it unfolds, not a second before.  That's what's funny about comedy improv, watching players discover in the moment what the scene's about.  And the game is usually something little, something accidental, like everyone's wearing too much jewelry on the job.   That's it.  You and your partner figure out as you go what the game is in the scene based on the information you uncover, step by step.  I keep cringing when I think about kids buying this book because instead of learning to explore character, activity, emotion, dialogue and stage picture as a way to build a throughline from scratch, they're being handed pre-packaged "plots" which burden the player with required attitudes and, saps the life and comedy right out of everything.  The only way these scenarios may work is if you teach the kids to take the opposite point of view to what's expected. "It's 3AM and you were expected home from your prom three hours ago.  That's my boy! 
 I loved House of Leaves, its unconventionality, its layers.  I could not stand this book.  Make sure you understand this is a book of verse - a long narrative poem (and yes, it rhymes).  I just could not get into it, the language annoyed me, the characters were not interesting to me.  Was there a plot of some kind?  It didn't work for me, which is really frustrating if you know what Danielewski is capable of 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 It is a very lovely two piece set. And Amazon shipped it to me twice, and both times it arrived in more or less a pile of shards. I gave up, but from what I could tell from the remains, this set is a very nice heavy earthen bakewear. I'm not sure, considering the shipping problems, whether the set could survive normal jostling in storage cabinets or a dishwasher 
 I have admittedly not read the book BUT the TV movie was a steal on The Haunting of Hill house 
 Some talented DVD editor should take the latest 3 movies, and cut out the dumb scenes (about 75% of each movie) and put them all together to make one decent movie 
 God this guy is absolutely pathetic, he's now one of the richest people in music but for doing what? Wearing excessive gold, not having an ounce of talent in his body? for singing in his childish lyrics how much of a bad *ss he is or for getting shot however many times ( which unfortunately didn't kill the b***ard ).  The answer is yes; this is why he is rich.  It's worrying to know there are enough plain stupid people in this world to actually buy this c**p, just goes to show how much unoriginal land sheep like these people are to just go with the trend and "enjoy" listening to this p**ck.    Like basically every other Hip - Hop artist to exist today, the stuff they write about and get paid millions of dollars for isn't in my opinion music - Some uneducated piece of s**t from a broken home basically talking about how hard there life is and how rich they are now.  And when it comes to Hip Hop, the actual music its self is only 50 perCENT of the cra**y package, oh no because not only are these losers showing off in their lyrics, their image and the way they present themselves on TV to them is just as important.  It's almost impossible these days to flick through the music channels and not fins some idiot wearing to much gold, baggy clothing leaning up against some flash car with half a dozen women surrounding him because as far as there concerned music is about image when it is anything but that.  Music's about meaningful lyrics, proper instruments, i.e. a guitar if any of you hip hop fans know that that is and melody.  Posing yes, I agree this c**ks pi**es all over any other musician when it comes to posing, but sadly I don't think any talented musician would really care about that because they can feel comfortable wearing regular clothing as they don't need expensive over the top garments to make themselves feel good as their music can make them feel good enough.  So there we have it my review, I'm sure a lot of you want to kill me for writing this, if so your either a complete r**ard or just scared to face the fact that your one of the sheep in the mindless flock. 
 I bought this copy of Kenneth Grahame's wonderful classic because the illustrations were so lovely.  When I read the book however, I realized that this book, albeit with beautiful illustrations, was heavily abridged.  I am sorely disappointed by this, and feel it should be clearly marked in the labeling of the book 
 Very disappointed.  I ordered this movie for a birthday that has come and gone.  I still don't have the movie.  I can't seem to find an 800 number to call to check up on it.  I sent the seller an email asking for his help in expediting it to me.  I never heard anything.  Very, very disappointed 
 We were very disappointed with this toy that we bought as a gift for a friend's baby. The daughter absolutely loves it, but the suction does not work at all. It is really too bad, because it would be perfect for a high chair toy 
 This book is utter trash.  The techniques described are confusing and hard to understand. You have to concentrate on so many things at once it becomes tiresome.  Also there is no sort of description of WHAT you will feel as you project.  I gave up until I found William Buhlman's "Adventures beyond the body" by only reading the narration and journal entries contained in the first 2 chapters I was able to begin the initial stages of projection WITHOUT all the nonsense.  Throw this book in the trash if you were unfortunate enough to Purchase it.  I wish i never ha 
 I recently finished reading the book. It was very disturbing to me. Throughout the book, I have been trying to understand what Rob Bell believes. He isn't very clear as to what he truly believes. He makes small statements and you think you might be getting to the core, but then he says something else.    The first part of the book left me with this "question" everything. The statements made were very odd to me.  He made this statement on page 012 to 013.    "For many people the word Christian conjures up all sorts of images that have nothing to do with who Jesus is and how he taught us to live. This must change. For others, the painting works for their parents, or it provided meaning when they were growing up, but it is no longer relevant. It doesn't fit"  I agree that the label "Christian" doesn't mean the same thing today. Because so many "religions" are under "Christian", but saying it worked for our parents and doesn't fit, it is what struck me.  Let's say the parents are firm believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, and believe He died for them, and if they believe the He was raised from the dead and rose again, they will be save.   So let's say they are Born Again Christians.  Then their child gets this book. Say they don't have a close relationship with their Savior.  They may think "gee my parent's views don't fit me; they are old, no longer relevant".  So they question the Truth, they question and get lost.    Rob Bell makes such a small statement, but it's a large one. In a sense he is saying, make the Truth fit you! But Jesus says in  John 14:6 Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."  So Jesus is the Truth. Can we fit Him to our ways? The Truth is the Truth, you cannot change it. If it changes how is it Truth?  He makes many statements in the first 2 chapters that are wrong.   Then the middle parts of the book start with so many strange ideas. He still doesn't make himself clear as to what he believes. From what I got from the middle is this statement mostly "All Truth is God's Truth". Although I don't see HOW, and he doesn't explain it well.  If all Truth is God's Truth, what is Truth? How do we know what Truth is? It should be stated, All God's Truth is Truth. Then we have ground to stand on. But making every truth God's makes way for any religion or belief that seems "good". That's just a nutshell of the middle.  This is one of them found on page 075 to 076.  Rob Bell says "Last year some friends asked me to be the pastor for their wedding ceremony. They had been together for a while and decided to make it official and throw a huge weekend party, and they invited me to be part of it. They said they didn't want any Jesus or God or Bible or religion to be talked about. But they did want me to make it really spiritual. The bride said it in her own great way, `Rob, do that thing you do. Make it really profound and deep and spiritual'".  My first thought was, how do you make it spiritual AT all without, Jesus or God or Bible let alone religion!?   I recently asked one of my friends, lets take Peter from the Bible. Do you think he would do that wedding? Do you think he would think that's so spiritual?  I mean Rob Bell could make it "spiritual" with New Age stuff, but that's religion. I do not believe in New Age, that's just an example, to me how do you make it spiritual even in the non-Christian sense? What is this "spiritual" Rob is talking about?  And lastly, he attacks Heaven. He states it is here on Earth, we bring Heaven here.  Now I know we make this world better when we are saved by helping others and in a sense bring Heaven to them, by loving them, BUT Rob Bell says we don't go anywhere at the end of time.  He says our Earth is good, and we will be here forever.  At the end in Revelation it does talk about the New Earth, and Jesus reigning for 1000 years, BUT Rob Bell says we don't go anywhere; we stay here the whole time. Doesn't account for the Tribulation, and doesn't account for when we die.  Paul says in Philippians 1:21-23  For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far  So my question for Rob Bell is, if to die is to be with Christ, where are we going? Also it brings up this verse as well.  Matthew 6:19-20  19"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.  If we bring Heaven to Earth, and go nowhere at the end of time, where are the treasures we are storing up in Heaven? What are they, why don't we see them?  (Page 171) Rob Bell says "We are not going somewhere else at the end of time, because this world is our home. And our home is good"   (What about Tribulation in Revelation??)  (Page 150) Rob Bell also says "True spirituality then is not about escaping this world to some other place where we will be forever. A Christian is not someone who expects to spend forever in heaven there. A Christian is someone who anticipates spending forever here, in a new heave that comes to earth.  The goal isn't escaping this world but making this world the kind of place God can come to. And God is remaking us into the kind of people who can do this kind of work."  From my life as a believer is Jesus Christ, I have learned that it's all about Jesus. The Bible is not made up of codes and secrets, God made it plan and simple. Jesus wants to save, but we must first realize we are sinners, and go to Him.  It's not about what we DO; it's about the grace of the Lord.   Rob Bell takes the personal relationship with Jesus out; he makes it all about works and doing.  And the Bible clearly states Ephesians 2:8-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- 9not by works, so that no one can boast.  Rob Bell puts in his book he loves talking about his relationship with Jesus, but he had the opportunity in this book to talk about it, and I see it no where, and if this book IS his relationship. He doesn't know Jesus.   2 Peter 2:1-3 But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves. 2Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 3In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.  All in all, there is truth in this book, laced with LOTS of deception.  Be careful when you read it.  And keep in mind, if you like this book, and you only like some of what it is saying. The minute you promote it, people may not know you only like some of it. They'll start to believe it all. Stand by someone you can believe everything they stand for on. 
 The Lando Calrissian Adventures (1983.) A collection of three short Lando Calrissian stories, written by L. Neil Smith in 1983.   INTRODUCTION:  The Empire Strikes Back introduced a classic character into the Star Wars universe - Lando Calrissian. Although Lando got a bad rap from fans at first for selling out Han Solo in Empire, he redeemed himself in Return Of The Jedi, assisting in the destruction of the second Death Star. However, like many Star Wars characters, Lando's past remained a great deal mysterious. To try to clear up some details about Lando's past prior to his movie experiences, L. Neil Smith wrote three short stores in 1983. And in recent years, those stories were combined into a book entitled The Lando Calrissian Adventures. Are Lando's past exploits some of the finest Star Wars stories around, or are they the black sheep of the Star Wars Expanded Universe? To find out, continue reading.   OVERVIEW:  Essentially, these stories follow a young Lando Calrissian, back before he lost the Millennium Falcon to a younger Han Solo in that fateful Sabacc game. Through an odd twist of fate and the threats of outside authorities, Calrissian is forced to go on a quest to a distant world to retrieve an ancient artifact with incredible powers. Along the way, he encounters strange locales and even stranger natives. The latter two stories expand on the events told in the first.   REVIEW:  Ugh... This is, without question, THE WORST STAR WARS EXPANDED UNIVERSE NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ. You'll notice I rarely give less than three stars to Star Wars novels, so to get two stars, Smith really must have screwed up. Sure enough, he did. These stories are just plain WEIRD. They don't even feel like Star Wars stories, and in many cases, it seems that Lando has a totally different personality than the guy we knew and loved in the movies. The stories are bizzare and drag on for far too long. Usually I can't put down a Star Wars novel, but had to FORCE myself to read this one. Every Star Wars novel I have read that existed prior to 1991's Heir To The Empire that isn't a movie adaptation is NOT worthwhile. But even Splinter Of The Mind's Eye, Alan Dean Foster's awkward story from 1978, kills The Lando Calrissian Adventures dead. I can not recommend this novel to anyone, except for those trying to read every last Star Wars novel - and even THEY should consider avoiding this one.   EDITION NOTES:  This book has been reissued a few times over the years, and it is still readily available in nearly all bookstores. If you want to read it (not sure why you would, though), it shouldn't be too tough to find. And if you can't find it in stores, there are plenty of online stores that carry it.   OVERALL:  The Lando Calrissian Adventures fails like no other Star Wars novel before or after has failed. L. Neil Smith takes the galaxy far, far away to new lows with these pathetic excuses for adventures. Of course, I have to cut him some slack since this WAS 1983, and the Expanded Universe hadn't really taken off yet. That's why he gets a sympathy star in my rating. My final verdict is simple - avoid this book like the plague. Even die-hard Lando fans are bound to be disappointed. If you're interested in a young Lando, read A.C. Crispin's Han Solo trilogy. He appears in those stories, and in much better ways, too. So just buy them instead. 
 The Title of this CD threw me off; the description and the first review didn't help either.  The primary reason for buying this CD was the song "You Are My Sister", but this version is a duet with someone that can't sing. I can't tell which CD has a version of the song as seen on Letterman. Disappointing 
 If you are looking for a camera that has everything you need to transfer movies to your computer this is NOT it. It WILL work if you get the cable and you use a software suite such as Nero (that often comes w/ DVD burners)- but these things don't come with the camera. The size of the camera is great as well as the battery life. The biggest problem, and an important one at that, is that we found this camera to have a dark picture- picture was a bit grainy and pixely and especially poor performance in low lighting. Battery life & size were not good enough to sacrifice sharp picture quality and bright picture & colors. 
 Kirsch's account of King David's life is highly questionable to say the least. The book is full of conjecture. The flaws in the author's reasoning are apparent on the face of every page. His perception of King David's relationship with God and country is severely unschooled and a danger to follow. Anyone interested in appreciating the true story of "The man after God's heart" would be better off reading the Biblical accounts. Don't waste your money on this quack historian who seems committed to justifying base persuits with the flaws of the great men and women of Biblical antiquity 
 This watch is a good size, pretty comfortable, and nice looking for a sport watch. But resetting time or date, or figuring out how to turn off the alarm when you set it by mistake (when you were trying to figure out how to reset the time and date) is super frustrating. The buttons are impossible. I've had it with mine and will buy another product 
 For those people who didn't make it through the book, here is a (perhaps oversimplified) summary.  Assumption 1 : Machines function algorithmically. The human brain functions at least partly non-algorithmically   Assumption 2 : There are some mathematical problems that can not be solved by algorithms f.i. proving the correctness of a self-referring statement.   Conclusion from 1 and 2 : Humans are able to solve problems that machines will never be able to solve.  Assumption 3 : Intelligence means being able to solve every possible problem.  Conclusion : Humans are intelligent, machines will never be intelligent.  My thoughts on this :  assumption 1 : Non-algorithmically ? There is not a shred of evidence of non-algorithmic thinking in humans. There are on the other hand plenty of mechanisms taking place in the brain that are clearly algorithmic (like vision, pattern recognition etc.)  assumption 2 :  Apparently Penrose believes that humans are able to solve these problems. I am not so sure. I challenge you to answer the next question correctly : Will you answer "no" to this question ? It cannot be answered correctly. It is in the nature of the problem itself. The problems Penrose mentions are of the same nature.  assumption 3 : We don't know the nature of consciousness. We have no understanding of what intelligence implies. Penrose believes it implies that an intelligent creature is able to solve EVERY problem. Therefore, if there is one problem a machine can not solve, the machine is not intelligent. So the only thing Penrose has to do to prove his point is ask a question that has no correct answers : ask the machine to overcome the incompleteness theorem of G?del, or to answer the above question correctly. (and ignore the fact that people cannot answer it correctly either).  I have enjoyed the book in a way ... while seeking arguments to demolish Penrose's theory. 
 How could a supposedly comprehensive compilation of VU tracks not contain a single cut from Loaded? Where's "Sweet Jane"? Where's "Rock 'n Roll"? Those songs are just as much a part of VU's legacy as anything from VU & Nico, and it's ludicrous that they aren't represented. Sure, John Cale left prior to Loaded, but that doesn't mean it isn't a part of the band's catalogue. Also, there's an obvious predilection on the part of whoever assembled this CD to negate all the great experimental work the band put out. "European Sun" is arguably as significant a VU & Nico track as "Heroin", and where's "Sister Ray"? Including only "White Light/White Heat" and "Here She Comes Now" makes White Light/White Heat seem like The Velvet Underground and Nico Part II, which it obviously is not. WL/WH should be appreciated for the dark nihilist art piece that it is. Let's have a real VU retrospective, one that better encapsulates the band's monolithic influence on American art. Better yet, let's not have any retrospective at all. 
 As a former student of the O.S., I feel entitled to interrupt Raines' eulogizing about Bettelheim with a few questions: 1) Why is it so easy for this Raines guy to downplay, whitewash, sugarcoat etc., the repeated beating of  emotionally disturbed children and teens? I mean if he was being beaten by Bettelheim in the name of a very distorted theory (namely that beating and shaming children will help them overcome their fear of inner aggression), would he so easily rationalize that abuse was good for him?  2) Why is this guy so impressed by how beautiful the Orthogenic School looks? Why does this prove that Bettelheim has the best interests of children at heart? I sure didn't care about fine china or pretty tiles while someone was repeatedly pounding on my body to get me to eat...and by the way depriving me of seeing anyone privately in sessions for the first 4 years of my stay there.  I think Theron Raines needs a course in how to relate compassionately to children.   Also, I want to offer an alternative explanation for why Bettelheim created the Orthogenic School. Raines includes Bettelheim's explanation at face value. First a look at Bettelheim's explanation. Bettelheim says he based his idea for the O.S. on his stay in a Nazi concentration camp. When Bettelheim saw how this sadistic milieu so completely destroyed personalities of sane people, he realized that he could rebuild destroyed personalities by creating a nurturing, understanding milieu. Well, this explanation sounds so nice at face value. However my sense of the underlying truth is that Bettelheim hid his deeper motives possibly from himself and certainly from others. He actually created an environment with certain rather horrific similarities to the concentration camps. Of course, not nearly as horrific. But, remember, the population that came to the O.S. already had weakened or damaged or destroyed personalities, plus they were children...so the Orthogenic School's cruel, sadistic side didn't have to be so blatant to wreak havoc on these emotionally fragile people. I think Bettelheim was enraged when he saw weakness or vulnerability in children. In fact, I think he was drawn to autistic children because he admired how disconnected they were from their feelings. But, for those children who actually still showed some vulnerability, well they got the smacks and the whacks and the beltings and the nasty cracks. I think Bettleheim created the O.S. as an outlet for his own rage at being made to feel powerless and abused at the camps. He used his brilliance to hide his true intentions. And I guess for many reasons, no one ever said boo to him about his thirty years of abusing children. Maybe some staff just assumed he must be right because the University of Chicago supported his work. Maybe some staff were too intimidated by him to question what he said or to report his terrible abuse of children. Maybe some staff got off on being cruel to children themselves. Maybe some staff were dumb.   Now, Raines tries to prop up his idealized picture of Bettelheim with reports of children with "Good Leavings". And he focuses on one "success story" in particular. But, from reading this "success story's" own version of events (in a book entitled The Thing I Was),  it appears that one of the MOST successful graduates was practically overcome with ambivalence about what Bettelheim did to him. Even this person describes Bettelheim as capable of terrible physical cruelty and shaming. And even this person clarifies that the main reason he was able to feel better about himself was because of a compassionate counselor who did her best to protect him from Bettelheim.   But, somehow, in Theron Raines' heart of hearts, the abuse seems to mean nothing to him. He doesn't seem to care about all the children who suffered terribly during Bettelheim's reign. So, please read this book with a grain of salt 
 This is a review of the "Ultimate Collector's Edition," NOT a review of the film itself. If you're considering the purchase of a two-disc special edition, you probably already know that the film is great; you just want to know if this slick package is worth the pricetag.   In short, it's not. And let me be absolutely clear about one thing: I have known and loved this film for years. A few sequences look properly spectacular, but after watching this DVD on two separate (and high-quality) televisions, I'm amazed that all of the low-light scenes have been rendered almost completely dark. Like, too dark to tell what's even *happening*. For instance, the scene where Brad (Harry Carey, Jr.) runs off to his death, the scene where Marty's (Jeffrey Hunter's) "bride" is serving coffee along the river, and even the pre-dawn scenes leading up to the final storming of the Comanche camp, are utterly lost in the dark. By contrast, the bare-bones 1997 DVD release features noticeably richer colors in the daytime scenes and total clarity in the low-light scenes I've just mentioned. Don't waste your money on this special edition; you'll be much happier if you just shell out the $10.99 for the 1997 release. 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 Is the first time I tried to read an E-book and the experience was very unconfortable. Unconfortable to read, impossible to record as a file, only to read in 1 PC, and at the end, impossible to print! Please try another way to sell electronics books 
 John Benson was once the world's authority on rotisserie-style play and pioneered a number of useful evaluation techniques, as well as putting out this annual (and the lamented A-Z guide, now no longer available now that Benson's cannibalized the old Waggoner book.) In those years, I was a devoted buyer of the annuals, as it was a scarce resource of badly-needed information for the roto-head.  That was then, this is now. Take a pass. The book basically hasn't changed for years, and the contents are barely phoned in.  It's full of stale information, aggravatingly trite and ambiguous player comments, and valuations that make no sense the way roto is played now. There have been no innovations in this book for years -- not an index, not making page thumb guides, no advice about 5x5, and utterly nothing that can't be had significantly cheaper and more accurately in a dozen other sources 
 Paul Rogers is (probably) the best rock singer of the last 40 years - not counting Paul McCartney's mind-numbing performance of "Oh Darling". That said, this CD falls prey to the concept that radio programmers know exactly  what people want to hear when it comes to classic rock. And frankly, they may be right. I can imagine every boom-box on any construction site in America plays tunes that 'middle America' thinks are the only classic tunes that Bad Co ever recorded. (Equally sad is the notion that "Aqualung" is the only classic tune ever recorded by Jethro Tull - much like the generation before us thinks that Glen Miller only recorded three good songs). There is a song from Run With The Pack that easily outdistances anything on this CD, or anything else Bad Co ever recorded for that matter. It's called "Sweet L'il Sister", and if I had a dime for every time it's been played on the radio in the last twenty years, I'd owe you ten cents. But that's the way of the world, I guess. Except for the Beatles, every classic rock band seems to have been distilled down to the songs you hear most on the radio. In another ten years I wonder if 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' will be the only Nirvana song we ever hear on the radio (assuming we aren't all listening to Sirius)? Probably so, my friend 
 This book claims that Monty Python inspired SNL (Saturday Night Live). Only slightly true. SNL's biggest inspiration was Rowan and Martin's Laugh In and even the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (both from before 1969 when Python started). Also, book claims Python inspired comedian Richard Pryor. Huh? Pryor had his own succesful comedy routine in the 1960's before 1969. Also, this book talks about not everyone liking Python as though those that don't are few in number. Probably more folks in the USA over 12 years of age don't like Python than do. 
 I've given this book two tries---- once with my eyes and once with my ears (iPod). I just can't get through it. Sometimes the starred reviews in SLJ and Booklist completely mystify me-- this is a book that needs some filling in. The characters have the complexity of line drawings. I bet there's a good book here; it just needs a few more drafts.   For example, the protaganist's new friend--- I'm sure there are less believable characters in literature, but I can't think of any at the moment. And the little goofy bits of description--- the father remarks that the boy's school smells like every other school, like chalk. Ok, who here can dredge up the odor of chalk? Have I just missed the odor of chalk all these years working in a school? It all reminds me of narrators who refer dramatically to the smell of blood-- when really that's a remark that only a vampire character is justified in making. Have I been missing the well-known smell of blood all these years, too? Good lord, the smell of chalk. Granted, the father character also says the school smelled of gym socks, and that smell would apply to the locker room. Quibbles, yes. But when the characters are so dull, my mind drifts to the little annoying flaws of language. Whose doesn't?   When I saw Chicken Boy was up for a 2008 Grand Canyon Reader Award, I thought I would just chime in here. Different strokes, I guess--but kids will be bored by this book. Librarians, be ready to contend with the smell of boredom 
 Whats the big deal? Neko Case is a great musician in her own right. In fact, her songs were the only ones on the alblum I actually enjoyed. Bones of an Idol is a great song, but I really dont see the appeal of this faceless band. If its rock, then its not very good. I would give them the benefit of the doubt that they are so artsy that theyve come full cirle back to plain, old dirty rock. 
 Imagine my disappointment when, after reading all of the reviews about Alan Rickman's great reading style, I get this audio book in the mail only to find that it's actually read by Peter Jeffrey. Alan Rickman's name isn't even on the jacket 
 Reading the reviews for this book I thought it would be a more substantial book than what I found.  It is a cute idea, but it is lacking in content.  Very disappointed...will probably end up as a garage sale book 
 The first time I put this workout DVD on, I expected to see exercises designed for abs, buns and thighs.  What I actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing DVD.  I kept going, thinking it would get to the abs, buns and thighs, but it never did!  The other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up, or headshots only, so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine, you can't even learn it, because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet.  Also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming, picking up on a different beat to where it left off.  All in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $4.86 paid.  I turned it off halfway through the second workout and put Billy Blanks TaeBo on instead.  MUCH BETTER!!!  
 I had to read this book for school this week. The first 20 - 30 pages were very slow and boring. In the end, the book was a slight more interesting. I would not recommend this book to my peers. I did not enjoy reading A Gathering of Days.  Some of my ideas of how the author could have made this book less boring: 1. Added more suspenseful climaxes 2. Taken out unimportant information 3. Wrote this book in regular format, not journal format 4. Used better word choices throughout the context of the book 
 The copy that I received had no plates/diagrams although it had plenty of references to the plates/drawings that should have been there.  I returned the book.  A disappointing purchase.  I gave 1 star because it is not possible to give no stars 
 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 Sheer and utter.  This hardly can be called a work of fiction.  Had this been his first work, I could understand the grammatical mistakes, but this is inexcuseable.  The publisher should be fined for this book and the editor fired 
 Ted and Elinor have been married and experiencing fertility problems.  Like most couples that are trying to have a child of their own, there are alot of emotions that both partners cannot understand.  Elinor is feeling completely useless and wonders why this is happening to her- and becomes ( understandably) wrapped up in her feelings, and well as her disappointment with her body that she is unable to conceive a child with her husband.  After failed attempts for IVF and other complicated fertility tries- she becomes very emotional and sad.   Ted- just withdraws from his wife and meets a woman- Gina and starts an affair.  Gina has a son that "falls in love" with Ted and he mentors him. Elinor finds out about both Gina and her son and Ted's extreme interest and sort of "completely distances" herself from Ted and everyone.  Now my problem with this story is this- yes, going thru something in a marriage such as infertility is terrible- The woman who goes thru 98% of all the tests, drugs- hormones- feelings on an extended level needs to be comforted more than her husband.  We know he loves her- but................. to have the author then have Ted have and affair and she has a child- I thought just would "stab" Elinor in the heart- then to make matters sadder...........Elinor becomes pregnant and again looses the baby.......  Well at that point- I just lost all hope for a possible happy ending and I finished the book- but wow- I think I needed some chocolate to something that would brighten up my day and my mood.  Talk about SAD  :  
 I have tried the AOL's cd that gives free connection for 3 months, and when I wanted to cancel the subscription (because I changed my home address) it was impossible to stop the bank tranfers. As incredible as this may sound, AOL claims that they cannot cancel my subscription because I don't remember my password. Even when I am able to confirm all other information (credit card number, date of birth, social, etc), they refuse the cancel the subscription. When I talked to my bank, the bank clerk told me that many people have had the same problems with AOL. I have met dozens of people in my University that faced very similar problems with AOL. AOL has a very bad approach to business and found a easy and certain way of losing customers 
 I am a lover of Japanese movies. I even purchased a masterpiece (Sadakan No. 8) for $50 for a VHS. I have a huge collection of Japanese jems.  So I know what I'm talking about. Heck I'm even Japanese myself :-)   But let me tell you--MABOROSI must mean MAJOR BORING..This movie can be condensed easily into 30 minutes and probably be still too boring. Yumiko is traumatized as a kid as grandma says she wants to go away and die...please stop you are too young to die..but grandma leaves anyway and Yumiko dreams about this repeatedly. Yumiko has a hubby and kid and hubby commits suicide. She mops throughout the movie from start to finish. She wears nothing but black and rarely smiles and sustains a flat affect. A totally unrealistic movie; in real life, Yumiko would have to worry about getting a job and pay bills rather than worrying about her psychological traumas because she has a kid to take care of. (her husband was some kind of laborer.)   THE MOVIE IS DREADFULLY BORING. BORING. BORING. BORING. It goes into trivial daily life and irrelevant conversations and becomes the whole of the movie with very little plot. It goes on and on and on making you sleepy sleepy sleepy...   Masterpiece--HOW ON EARTH????? It's another example how winning an international film prize does not necessarily mean it is good.   Now if you have problems with insomnia or need a sleep remedy-please by all means purchase this. It's hard to follow only because it puts you to sleep sooo well! I'm not exaggerating.   If you decide to purchase this BORING movie, and believe the hype of the critics as it is highly overrated, well, I warned you.   Thank you 
 I think that Palliser wrote one of the finest genre books of the latter 20th century in Quincunx. Every single page was a plot twist of sorts and will leave you breathless if you have yet to pick it up. But just as Palliser wrote such a complex book in Quincunx, 'The Unburried' is manifestly its very opposite. I really cant well describe this book because what the plot was about I really dont know. 'Unburried is so very slow and tedious the only way I could use this as a recommendation is as an insomnia remedy.  I really don' t think that the two reviewers chosen to be 'Spotlight Reviewers' actually read the book. I perused these reviews and was shocked at how different their opinions were to mine. They must have read the dust jacket and pieced together a review off of that. They are wrong in that this book is very very dull. Read 'Quincunx' and enjoy it, but leave this one be 
 The product arrived fine and on time from AccessoryOne.  But the cable would not stay connected in the USB port on my computer.  I had to hold it just right for the cable to stay connected.  I threw this cable away and wound up buying Verizon's Music Essentials Kit for my LG VX8600.  The Music Essentials Kit provided a cable and driver that work fine 
 Absolutely terrible.  So many good points all jumbled up.  It felt like it was written, by a grade 8 English student trying to impress a University crowd.  The flow was difficult to grasp and the book lacked that finished up.  Maybe she should have spent more time in editing.  There were so many grammatical errors.  Shira, really you can convey your message without vulgarity.  Your book tries to cross the lines of financial insight and a smut paperback.  Through a little sex in there and you got a Daniel Steel novel.  Really people, there are so many better books out there with the same information in them.  Try, Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey, or Your Money or Your life by Joe Dominguez.  Save your hardback dollars for something a little more professional, and hey Shira please do another revision after you have spent about 6 months cleaning this SH!^ up as you would have put it... 
 The way the concepts are presented in this text book are far from being fair. They are poorly demonstrated and use of pictures is poor. While it serves its use in giving information on virology at a great price, it fails  in comparison to other books, while double the price, worth it in every  way. I recommend saving up and getting either Medical Virology, 4th ED or  Sherris Medical Microbiology; either one is good and far better then this  title - as well as providing way more information, the latter book includes  key concepts in immunology, parasitology and indepth on bacteriology. Don't  be fooled by the price, this information isn't presented clearly to learn  virology off of. If you're serious in learning about virology and/or  infectious diseases, check out first the books stated above first 
 This book is simply awful. I gave up after a hard slog through ninety percent of this dreck. The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead 
 This stuff about "coming of age" "family dynamics" is [expletive]! Hoffman writes abuse/dominance fantasy. Not the obvious whips, leather and latex, but the less obvious, but more real, _acceptance_ of being abused and dominated. Repeatedly in this book, the protagonist (and others) are placed under spells of dominance and compulsion, and spells that change their personality into someone who's the opposite of themselves. Does someone raise a voice of moral outrage? Nope. Call the equivalent of the magic police and have these sick criminals arrested for child abuse and/or magical mind rape? Nope. Instead Gypsum (the protagonist) uses _her own power_ to place herself under the control of others (e.g., "Altria, for an hour do what you want to me with my power.") What's really creepy about all of this, is that it's _not_ presented as creepy or scary -- it's presented as _normal_ -- part of the family dynamic.   When I first read two of Hoffman's other books ("Strength of Stones", "Threads that Bind the Bones"), what I loved was the visual description of her magic, of a world alive with various types of spirits. It wasn't until later, after I dealt with a friend who had been abused, that I really picked up on the abuse mindset implicit in the books. But in "Fistful of Sky", the visual effects are lessened and the theme of acceptance of abuse and dominance is strengthened. (At least in her previous books, her protagonists didn't _ask_ to be dominated!)  As I learned from dealing with my abused friend, abuse is self-perpetuating because the abused think that it's normal. Abuse is tied up with love -- the boyfriend who is really caring and loving one day and who beats and rapes the next. You'd think that any sane person would leave, but the abused seem to want to keep the loving relationship with the abuser, but just get them to stop the abuse. The protagonist in "Fistful of Sky" doesn't escape from that mindset -- she gels into it.  So, if this book strikes you as humorous (after the mother almost kills her daughter with a dominance spell, and a serial rapist gets off with the mildest slap on the wrist), or if you think it's a great coming of age story... You're either completely missing it, or you need to see a therapist who specializes in abuse issues 
 I'm shocked that in this day and age people are still taken in by "alternative medicine."  I find this book amusing in its complete lack of substance.  It really doesn't say anything.  Have you ever noticed how all of the alternatie medicine books and "professionals" always refer to these mysterious "body forces?"  Of course they never say how they work or what they are, they just spin some B.S. about how balance and harmony between the forces are key.  If you all stop buying their books, lectures and services, all of these malicious quacks will go away.  Its really very simple.  Please, please don't make the phrase "a fool and his money are soon parted" come true.  
 I apologize the the children's author for mis-using the title of a very good book, but it seemed so right!  Assuming that the Greeks lived much like the Oliver Stone asserts, and why not, then it was hard to be Macedonian, Greek, and royal.  There is enough angst in this movie for the rest of Alexander's cut short life.  Three hours of this much angst is three hours too much.  I give it 2 stars for the scenery, the story that is probably pretty spot on, and the fact that someone had the good sense to have Sir Anthony Hopkins and Christpher Plummer in the movie.  They are the redeeming features of the whole thing.  But I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a more historical venue.  Read a good book about it!!  Sorry, Oliver, but it's JFK all over again.  Plausible, but just not the case 
 This book does not provide enough examples, and the few they do give are nothing like the work problems. Every teacher I've had has said if they were not required to use it, they would use a different book. And on top of that, it is ridiculously expensive!  I have finally been forced to get another text book, and it is much better (and cheaper). Do not get this book if you have a choice 
 I wasn't even going to write a review until I stopped and read some of the reviews for this book already online.  This book is simplistic and silly.  Joan Anderson comes off as a pretentious and giddy middle-aged person who I don't think learned a thing from her time with Joan Erikson other than to throw out some words of wisdom.  I would like to know more about Erikson after reading this book, but I wish that Anderson would just get over herself and stop thinking that her words and experiences really matter - she herself questions her own authority often in the book and rightly so, she's an overdramatic, silly woman.  If you have absolutely nothing better in the world to do for 20 minutes, read this book - but don't buy it - I'll send you mine 
 This was one of five books that I brought from Amazon.com and by far the worst of the lot.  This man has one idea about how the government really works.  Take it from me I have been with the IRS for five years 
 This book has a very vast colection of terms and types of dress throughout history.  It reads like a regular dictionary, but consists souly of clothing terms.  This would be a good book for those who plan to study costume and dress through history, but not a good book for those with just a casual interest 
 Oh, dear. Le Carre is, or was earlier in his career, a brilliant writer.   I have read and reread a number of Le Carre books lately and what is clear to me is that the quality of his novels has deteriorated over the years, as one might expect, I suppose. Single and Single reads like something written to fill out a publishing contract for a certain number of books.  The plots meanders and is hard to follow. You may think that this is par for the course in the novels of Le Carre, but all I can say is that his better works like Spy Who Came In and Honourable Schoolboy have elements of this trickiness, but it is not overdone.  There is a certain tendency in modern English novelists--I'm thinking of people like Martin Amis--to give the reader a hard time, and in his later books Le Carre seems to be increasingly of the school of letting the reader try to figure out on his own what is going on in the book. My interpretation is that this is due to lazy writing, and the author losing sight of the reader. Others may disagree.  In earlier novels Le Carre leaned a great deal on what appeared to be inside knowledge of the espioniage business. Well, he had me convinced, anyway. Once he gets away from that territory, it seems to me that he is much more inauthentic.  My guess is that the character of Tiger Single is somewhat based on Le Carre's own father, who was something of a jet-set conman.  The book has plently of brilliantly witty  dialog, very much a Le Carre specialty, and passages of superb descriptive writing, so all is not lost, but I would only recommend it for the diehard Le Carre fan who has read everything else and has a lot of time on his/her hands 
  There are about 20% power thoughts in this CD/Book and rest are unpractical nonsense.  Nonsense like:  "I love every cell of my body" "Let the universe's solution come to you" "I am decisive in my decisions.  If I make a poor one, I'll just make another one."  I guess if you are completely foolish or just ignorant, this book will not help you much.  Your mother probably gave you much more and better advise than this book.  
 When she utters the line "I feel so violated"...Reba is totally inept as an actress in this movie.  THe story is inspiring and uplifting but McEntire is no actress.  She is a complete and total failure which bogs the movie down.  Its a shame they couldn't have had a "real" actress play this part.  THe movie would have been wonderful and worthy of a five star rating.  The supporting cast is o.k. but when they play off McEntire they look inept.  SHe makes them look bad.  I'm sorry but acting is not McEntire's forte.  
 Janet Taylor Lisle hooks you in with a story that evokes the best of popular fantasy with some Pippi Longstocking thrown in.  Then she sucker punches you with a depressing dose of misfortune devoid of fantasy and stripped down to a cold, sad version of reality that shocks and confounds.  The denouement involves mental illness, neglect and orphaning.  For more on this kind of approach to youth literature, check out "Welcome to Lizard Motel" by Barbara Feinberg 
 It pains me to write it, but this book was bad. I thoroughly enjoy most of Douglas Adams' work especially the Hitchhiker's series. Unfortunately, he missed the mark with this book. I personally believe Adams wanted this book to be very funny, ala, the Hitchhiker books (others disagree), since it was: strike one. The storyline was quite complex, which would be fine, but I'm not 100% certain this is what Adams was trying to do: strike two. Finally, Dirk Gentry just is not equal to Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect (Hitchhiker's main characters) in terms of full, colorful characters, the final strike. Maybe it was my high expectations after reading the Hitchhiker series, which I found incredibly entertaining at 14, 24 and 34 years of age (for different reasons) 
 this thing stinks! so much digital noise its output is terrible. I don't know how they can put this thing out and have it be so BAD. Don't be fooled thinking WOW 8 megs for a low price, I have a 5 meg sony that is many times better. all that noise blows the detail out. get it if you like lots of little green and red flecks in your pictures, other wise stay away 
 Joel Lane writes well and his descriptions are good. The stories themselves, however, are disturbing and leave one with unsettling thoughts. 
 I'll admit it - the quoted review by Hunter S. Thompson was a large factor in my decision to buy this book.  After having read the book, I can only assume that when he read it, Thompson was, well ... Hunter S. Thompson.  This story may have some relevance to some small segments of today's teens - but it's certainly not representative of the majority of them.  The 'bad guy' is an overblown Eddie Haskell (anyone else remember Leave It To Beaver?), held up as an icon of success by parents, fantastically wealthy from his own earnings, amazingly sadistic, and totally without fear of consequences - easy to despise, difficult to believe at all.  Are there parents as absent and ineffectual as this book depicts?  Certainly.  Are there teens as vicious and depraved as are shown in this story?  Oh, probably.  Is anyone as shallow and unthinking as the author claims is typical in the generation being "exposed" in this book?  If there is, I've never met them.  By the author's own admission, he was unable to lose his virginity until he was 18, yet he describes a high school world of casual sex and weekend orgies with no consequences at all.  In  essense, he whines about being excluded from this world he invents while he sneers at it.  Some titilating scenes, a fair narrative voice - not a total waste of time, but it certainly does not live up to the hype 
 Let's try to imagine something you'd want to learn from your Southern Spain guidebook once you get there. How to pronounce Spanish? Sorry, the glossary in the back has no pronunciation guide, just glosses every word in the Spanish spelling. Oddly enough, although they don't tell you how to pronounce each letter, they tell you how each is spelled in the Spanish language.  Hmm, what else? Whether or not to tip your taxi-driver on the way home from the airport? Nope, sorry. There are two entries on taxicabs, neither of which mention that you don't tip.  Siestas? Southern Spain is full of siestas. They have them every day. The times vary between regions, though, and you should really know when they are because you won't be able to access food or drink or some attractions during the siesta. This book doesn't mention them. AT ALL. This is an appalling omission.  The maps for the various cities aren't even a page big, making them utterly useless. The book itself, because it is inexplicably printed on heavy glossy paper (this book is really into the fact that it has several full-page photo spreads to help you get 'into the mood,'), weighs more than anything else I brought with me on vacation. It was so heavy that I had to ditch it on a day-long trip to Granada. Needless to say, it was not missed.  If you buy this book, you're an idiot 
 This book had some interesting half-baked ideas about society, but it felt like a bunch of stories thrown together, straining for connection.  I didn't really like or relate to anyone in the book, and felt vaguely depressed upon finishing it.   I wish I had stopped reading in the middle.. 
 I was very disappointed to see that the cards all say Season's Greetings or Happy Holidays.  On the box it says Christmas Cards so why dont they say Merry Chistmas?  I think it is shameful.  We have take  Christmas out of the season and it is misleading it say Christmas Cards on the box and there is nothing about Christmas inside.  i would not buy these for  anyone else 
 Do not read this book. I attempted to read this book for a college class. This book should be cut down to the size of a magazine article and be published in a scientific journal. The public should not be misled into thinking that this book is readable. It is written at too high of a diction, and Griffin rambles on for 20 pages on one topic, which I won't spoil for those of you unfortunate to read this trash. The subject information is interesting, but this is written poorly, and will bore the reader to tears. Just thought I'd let you all know 
 The book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading.  If you don't know anything about database marketing, then you will get something out of this book.  If you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis, loyalty programs and relationship marketing, there is nothing new here.  In fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is The Loyalty Effect by Reichenheld or Customer Connections by Wayland and Cole.  The subtitle mentions the dot com world, but the book has little to say about the Internet.  The book really does not cover CRMs (as oppsed to database marketing) in that it fails describe how CRM systems work and what database, modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them 
 This book is neither a good book on selling over eBay not a good book on setting up a company. Trying to be "all things" to all people, it comes out as very superficial and almost anecdotal. Don't let the pagecount fool you: the 548 pages, with better layout (almost half of each page is white space) could be cut down to 200 or so, without much information being missed. And then, there's the dubious use of the information left. Having read the more technical "eBay Hacks" at the same time, though not focused on the business side of things, I found it to be a lot more useful. If you're looking to set up an eBay shop, go to eBay and read about it, and save yourself $17.47 in the process 
 HEY!  NEVER LIKED JA FOOL! HE IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE OVER! WHERE IS HE??????? LIKE I CARE! ANY WAY!!!!  50 HAS SOLD 16 MILLION+ CD'S AND JA FOOL HAD THE NERVE TO SAY 50 DON'T SELL!! HA!!!!!! JA FOOL!!!  GREATEST HITS!!!!!!!!!! NUFF SAID!  OVER JA FOOL RULE!! 
 I bought the cd three weeks ago and I still do not have it. Whatever you do, don't buy from amazon because they cheated me out of my own money. The description says, usually ships within 2-3 days. I could see being off with five days or so, but this is insane 
 Being an enthusiast of the EB, and already owning a software version and an old paper edition, I was very thrilled by the possibility of having access to the EB on my pda as well. No more would I be left musing about a strange place name on a book read in the cafe, or wondering what the currency of a country might be called... It was a disappointment, then, to find that the "Concise" in the name of the product is an euphemism for grossly abbreviated; many articles do little more than state the obvious about their topic. Moreover, one wonders why this needs to be the case, as current SD cards have become  cheap and have enough capacity to contain a lot more text. Is it the desperate need for claiming 900 "illustrations" 
 First of all, I must say I did not finish the book, despite its minimal size.  I began reading this book because I am very interested in Art History, and reading historical fiction.  This novel is based on Vermeer's painting, "the Music Lesson".  I found very few references to Vermeer at all in the novel, and was very bored with the story line.  Granted, I did not read all the way to the finish, but I was so bored with the story thus far, I couldn't. 
 all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop, its not what LL, Rakim, KRS-one, Kool G Rap, Ice T, Ice Cube, NWA, and (rip) BIG AND PAC, started.  We as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS, THIS FAKE RAP IS GOT TO STO 
 As usual some italians never miss a chance to complain and bash about things they either don't have or don't understand. Clearly the author has been living in the stone age far too long. What does he mean with "How many people have actually ever bought an airline ticket over the internet?". Probably every single person I know! Or "How many people have actually ever sent data over the internet?". Practically the entire US population! His observations are not only shallow and over analyzed, most of them are just not accurate. Further, he fails to capture the true underlying issues embedded in the American way of life. The social and cultural issues that are ripping this country apart. A very poor analysis of non-issues that are, for the most part, just a result of his ignorance. His arrogance. Money NOT well spent I must say. P.S. I am an Italian living in the US 
 Boy this movie was weird and psycho. I happen to like the weird movies but it was WAY off the psycho side for me. Friends try to cover up an "accidental death" from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong. Things like this, I try to stay away from. Although I am glad I saw it so I won't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not. Now I know. I gave it 2 stars because the movie DID have it's charms. 
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 This novel of a 17th century samurai's odyssey to Europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way, but towards the end, Endo does get in a few good points. The style is somewhat pedantic and staid, but easy to read. It's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here. I can only conclude that a lot of people who don't really have much experience of Japan, think they've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian. Remember, not every Japanese woman is a geisha, and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai's sword 
 i thought baby would be much more interested in this. it's colorful and easy to grab -- but for some reason, it's a non-starter 
 I liked White Oleander so much that as soon as Paint it Black became available, even tho I'm committed to buying used books as an environmental measure, I had to have it right away and so bought the hard-cover.  Having read it, I must say I'm more than a little disappointed.  For me, Josie never really came alive, nor did Michael.  Most of the actions of the people in this story didn't make sense or didn't ring true.  Unlike the characters in White Oleander, I never cared much about any of these characters.  The story is pretty stagnant; I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Instead, all of the dropped hints earlier never get picked up.  Just as I was almost done reading the book, I thought, "OK, there's still time to reveal a shocker:  maybe Michael's mother tracked him down at the motel and, realizing that he could not escape her, he killed himself."  But no, the story just fizzles out.  We are left wondering if Josie's suspicions are true about Michael and his mother.  And how thick could this supposedly street-smart girl be if she didn't figure out until hundreds of pages after the reader did, that the housekeeper cared deeply about her wellbeing?! 
 This book is the worst book i have ever read. It doesn't make any sense, and very hard to understand. I reccomend this book to no one 
 Stallone goes into a d-tox clinic in the chilly regions 3 months after his girlfriend dies from the hands of a killer. He checks in with other frustrated and insane cops(sorta like the NCPD, Nut Case Police Department) and hes trying to get rid of those demons, but the killer is back for more, who could it be(I knew who the killer was when he got there). when you got a good cast like this your always suspecting a good ride but the cast cant make this one live and breathe. stupid wooden characterizations, dumb dialouge. only the performance from Stallone and the grisly awesome spiked up finale is what keeps it alive. something you'd expect greatly from the director of I Know What You Did Last Winter. this one gives you frostbiting icicle nuts. the cast include Stallone, Sean Patrick Flannery(who was good for his part), Robert Patrick(too whiny and flaunting his masculinity), Robert Prosky(who gets the chair), Kris Kristofferson(whats up Doc), Polly Walker(ever so beautiful), Jeffrey Wright(the only thing standing out was his face), Charles Dutton(fat and plump), Christopher Fulford(ahhhh, the british are coming), Courtney B. Vance(could of been more better with his preist cop), Dina Meyer(thank god she died) and Tom Berenger(his character was the most annoying) 
 I love Sophia Loren as an actress however this DVD as 3 movies in one package is a very very very poor quality DVD. Colors are bad, picture is bad and the sound is even worse. don't waste your money. My DVD copy was bought from Amazon.  this is my advic 
 I cannot believe they WILL NOT change the price.  2 single packs are cheaper than 1 double pack.  I HAVE TOLD THEM several times that www.staples.com has it for $60.99 and www.officemax.com has it for $59.99 and with a $50.00 order-free shipping too. When they can meet or beat this price, I'll buy from them-amazon.com.  If I run out before, I'll go elsewhere. 
 This book is quite possibily the worst book on the subject.  Written by a prominent left-wing lawyer, the book does not give any pretence of a fair hearing for the evidence showing Oswalds guilt.  This is like reading a defense brief, not an unbiased book.  Skip it and read Posners Case Closed 
 steph believes her husband leaves her after thirteen years of marriage because of her boring flannel night gowns and unshaved legs. in the meantime, she meets peter and quickly falls in love.  peter is into bionics and while he goes away on business trips, he leaves behind his clone, paul to keep his girlfriend company.  steph is torn because she finds herself in love with both peter and paul.  when she's not having sex with peter, she's doing sexual acrobatics with paul.  the whole story line is utterly ridiculous.  the only reason i finished the book was because i was hoping it would get better.  i kept thinking this would make some kind of comedy.  unfortunately, i don't think danielle steel had comedy in mind when she wrote it.  i do believe the reader was supposed to get sucked into a romantic love triangle.  that didn't happen!  instead, i continued to dislike steph's insecure, sex crazed character less and less.  
 I bought this item as a gift, and it ended up becoming mine. I have to say, I am greatly dissatisfied. Here are some main issues I am having with the camera:  1. It is very poorly designed. The look and the feel of the camera are not elegant. Buttons are really ugly, and operating the camera is awkward, and for some functions requires both hands to   operate..  2. The camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally.  3. The worst, by far, is the picture quality. Colors are just plain terrible. Automatic settings are a disaster of photography. I have used a Canon (2MP) before getting this one (5MP). The Canon was far superior in quality, colors, lighting.. I don't need large files of trash, I am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures.  As a result, I am strongly recommending getting a different camera. I have had great experiences with Canon; and seems like Sony and Nikon are doind a good job too. But HP must stop making cameras, and indeed many other devices. 
 Mr. Lackmann has improved this book very much from the earlier edition which was loaded with made up facts and apparently little research.  Mr. Lackmann, in his acknowledgements, though has not given credit to the many readers who had written him to correct his mistaken information.  He acts as if somehow these facts were miraculously corrected by themselves.  There are better reference books on radio than this one.  Don't waste your time 
 This is not "Follies in Concert," it is the reader's digest version.  Many numbers have been truncated and many omitted, most notably "Waiting for the Boys Upstairs" and "The Road I Didn't Take."  While the concert itself ran over 130 minutes, the DVD is made from a 90 minute video tape.  Include the fact that they added about 30 minutes of rehearsal interviews, and the concert is basically cut in half.  In addition, the DVD is video tape quality and the sound is unstable.  All in all, a very disappointing recording for Sondheim lovers 
 I ordered this item on 2/28/07 and I still have not received it...today is 4/19/07.  I want a refund ASAP.  And I've been on hold forever trying to resolve this...answer the phone 
 Dave Barry's Bad Habits has comedy fiction writer Dave Barry trying his hand at the non fiction market.  Although he achieved quality work in this genre with later attempts such Homes and Other Black Holes, this book was clearly just cashing in on the success of his fiction with little effort put in whatsoever.  There's lots of references to Commies which either means Barry was extremely paranoid and brainwashed by his government of the time or he is retelling the same joke over and over again throughout the book, a joke that isn't that funny the first time and is really irritating when repeated and repeated and repeated.   Barry also insists on telling us his personal stories in this book, obviously the publishers had a word in his ear with future non fiction books as these stories are hardly evident in those books but unfortunately they are here and aren't that interesting.  Dave Barry can write some really good stuff, both fiction and non fiction.  Dave Barry's Bad Habits unfortunately is not one of those occasions. 
 Normally, I do not take the time to write up a poor book.  But in this case, I wanted to warn the open-minded that this book is nothing like what the other reviewers claim it to be.  Where to begin?  After reading all these glowing reviews by other readers, I felt that here could truly be a new look into an otherwise well researched area.  WRONG.  After trying to confirm some of the source material cited, I gave up.  Much of the supporting alleged facts are bogus, misreported, misquoted, unverified racist ramblings, or often just patently stupid.  Just because some crack-pot has published something, doesn't mean it's true and you can authoritatively cite it as a source.  You don't like a fact, then make up your own and publish it yourself.  If you are willing to believe anything that suits your biased pre-formed belief, then this book is for you. However, if you have a brain larger than that of an average chipmunk, you will probably give up reading after a couple of chapters and figure that watching reruns of The Brady Bunch is a more intellectually profitable use of your time than finishing this book.  Sadly, I can not but conclude that the glowing reviews are written by other true believers that are trying to revise history by yelling loudly and often.  This book adds nothing to the debate or the history of the topic it purports to discuss.  It is pure propaganda.  Don't waste your time or money. 
 "With the Dark Magicks that fill these pages" two types of cult could be founded: the cult of Kon-stantinos, or a cult of complete cynicism. As someone who cherishes his spiritual and magickal beliefs, I do not know which would be worse.   The author's insincerity is self-evident in every concept, and as usual he urges us to read on like we are about to encounter something earth-shattering...his tone is always "prescient" and always patronizing. The pseudo-goth aspect to Kon's writing is wearing seriously thin now and besides, any serious spiritual seeker will find the trappings insulting. His obsession with "naughty" alcohols such as the illegal absinthe is seriously sad.   His spiritual perspective is the same: he plays with a safe "bad boy" boy image but never has the balls to wrap it in anything but the "essentially I'm not so bad" image. The impression he gives to the intelligent seeker after spiritual inroads is that they do not sensibly exist in a modern and very contrived book such as this.  My one star I rate for "Nocturnicon" comes from the book cover, which is far better than the book deserves, and from the fact that he is quite a good technical writer. I have seen much worse get into print, including with his own publishing house, Llewellyn Publications. However if I was a cynic about occult arts, I would use this book to demonstrate why. As a reader I get the feeling that Kon-stantinos feels the same. He's looking to sell a concept, any concept. Here he happens to have fallen on one of the more questionable sets of references anyway - the Necromonicon - and in this case 1+1 = minus 5.   It seems that he is trying to mess us all up with that "little ****er" (he mentions in the intro) in his head. Either that or his misleading of the (mainly young deluded goth) public is incidental to his need for some kind of publicity. Which makes him a true Kon-man.                    
 The distinct impression I got from reading Moby-Dick is the complete and utter convoluted concept of the whole thing. It felt like I wrestling with Melville himself the entire time I was reading it. The first thing that put me off was the fact that huge pieces of the story were simply the author explaining things like an encyclopedia: what the different types of whales were, how to prep harpoons, the protocol for the officers to eat, and so on, and so on, and so on... What Melville could have said in one sentence-it seems-he said in ten pages. While it is true that there is a deeper literary meaning behind it, it's definitely covered up by the blatant symbolism that is thrown in the reader's face every page. What was told here could easily be told in a smaller format, as this book is loooong, and that fact is only amplified by the method in which it is told. Several times I found myself skipping pages just to see if anything interesting would happen in the near future. I suppose the best thing I could say about this book is that the chapters are short, so it makes it seem that it is going faster than it actually is 
 i really liked the first one and even went to my mom's house to pick up the second one (this) at 10:30 at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on. from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page 120. not much has happened to make me want to finish it. very boring. not really into roz and mitch characters, i don't think they are very well developed, they seem kind of blah. and the story is kind of blah. blah, blah, blah, and just words for the blah, blah, blah going on and on.  
 i am an honestly big fan of beyonce. i have both of her cds and have always loved destiny's child. i even love her new song "beautiful liar". but i think that it is illogical for her to re-release this album, escpecially since releasing it in april defeats the purpose of naming the album "Bday" because her birthday is in september. but still, i can't help but love her new song. and i think that she did a great job with shakira. it is an unlikely collabo between two of the most successful artists of the decade, which makes it a great song. but shakira totally steals the spotlight with her stronger voice. i think this track should belong to shakira and she could use it as one of her tracks for her next album 
 The score to Cast Away is one of my favorites - right up there with Ennio Morricone's underrated instrumentals for "Once Upon a Time in America" - and it's a real shame that, apparently, the only album with music from the film is this compilation disc which doesn't even feature the full soundtrack. Luckily I got my hands on an Academy Awards advance album preview for Cast Away - the CD that Universal sent to the Academy Awards crew for Oscar consideration - and it has six beautiful tracks. But I know there are more out there and I think it's time the full soundtrack was released 
 This book appears to have been thrown together without anyone trying the recipes to see if the results are actually edible, or if all the ingredients we were asked to gather were used. It is frustrating to be told  to mix "all ingredients," then two sentences later be told to put  in another of the ingredients.  This is one example of many. The directions  are sketchy or downright inaccurate. There are so many obvious typos, that  I wonder how many of the ingredients and amounts are accurate or are also  typos. I dislike this book so much that I will not even give it away. What  a waste of money. This book may be good on the "lore" side, but  it is not a cookbook.  I am still looking for a good cookbook tailored to  home storage.  This isn't it 
 While Mr. Adamy may be an expert, apparently these books were thrown together a little quickly.  Read the text and all will be well.  Follow the example problems in the back and you're headed for a train wreck.  When he works the problems they are frought with mistakes, big, blatant mistakes.  For someone trying to learn EW the first time these are huge confidence deflators.  Find an independent source to check your answers 
 I read the book and I am convinced this Author did not read The Quran Shareef. She has no right to show her anti-islamic views to the world. I challenge her to read The Quran first then write. Islam is the only first religion which gives inheretance rights to woman. On one hand she does not belief in Allah, then she thank the God at the end of the book for helping her.She should apologise to Muslim poeple for lying about ISLAM & THE QURAN SHAREEF 
 The main thing to remember about this book is that it is a journal.  So if you are looking for a beginning, middle and end you won't find it here.  I kind of felt like "what is the point?" after I read it.  It was also hard for me to understand how Anais Nin could write all these words of love about Henry Miller.  I tried to read Miller's TROPIC OF CAPRICORN but I had to stop because he is such a misogynistic jerk. I couldn't believe the feelings of hate he had towards his poor first wife, and the way that he saw all women as trash.  I had a hard time not thinking that Anais Nin was crazy to risk her marriage to a wonderful man for a horrible man like Miller.  This is not a great book, but the one good thing about it is that it is very sensual and erotic 
 Unfortunately, I purchased and read this book on steroids. Of all the books on the subject, this was by far the worst. The "sources" of information (if you can even call the people sources) are questionable at best. He invents information and passed it on as fact. He will take 1 out of 25 studies -- the negative one and cite that as proof of his point, while ignoring the other 24 favorable or neutral ones.   I disagree with the 1/2 of the reviewers in this topic, though some bring up good points. Mr. "Objective" Nugent is not one of them. He has a major axe to grind.  All in all, not worth it 
 Ok, Some books should be judged by their cover. This is one of them. By the books own definition, bobbers are "a machine that had things cut or bobbed off." It then goes on to explain using a stock machine as a starting point. The bike on the cover, like about 80% of the bikes in this book, does not use a stock frame or front end as a starting point. Many of them are aftermarket raked and stretched frames using overlength front ends and mag wheels. Clearly not bobbers. This book should be called Art of the Custom Motorcycle. It is a decent book about modern custom bikes, but if I had the opportunity of browse the book prior to purchasing, I wold not have purchased it. I would categorize this book as a book written by people who are taking advantage of the recent bobber craze without knowing the true definition of the term. On the flip side, the book is a good value for what Amazon charges and if you are into custom bikes perhaps you should consider it. But don't expect to see traditional bobbers 
 I'm sorry I wasted the afternoon reading it....was about the worst thing I have ever read in its category.  Would have liked to rate it as NO stars but that is not an option.  Just happened to read it because it has been sitting here for 4 years since my mom died and I took i 
 So I ordered the magazine in Nov. 6, 2005. Its now Feb. 22nd, 2006 and the magazines (since I also ordered the Smithsonian and Scientific American) are nowhere to be seen. Of course, my account was quickly charged and at this pace, I'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before I receive any of them... so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine, it might be a better idea to get somewhere else.. 
 The premise was good and could have made for a good story line.  But come on, please.... am I really supposed to believe that Ben and Danielle can conduct all of these super human exploits with hardly a scratch?  They seem to pop up everywhere, just in time to save the day, while everyone else gets picked off like fleas!  Their wounds seem to heal supernaturally!  And then I'm supposed to believe that a pot head who's stupid enough to believe that he's going to get all A's for the semester because he's helping the government, can crack the computer code that none of the big boys can?  Nah...  I like my protagonists a little more human, capable of mistakes, and more believeable and thereby likeable.  I don't think I'll be reading any more of Land's books for a while.  This one supposedly took place over a 12 day period and that was about 11 days too long for me 
 Following the advice of the others on this page I duly purchased this book. I can now safely say it will be my LAST time following the general concensus! What is WITH you people?  A photographer/grafik designer by trade, specialising in print-based media I have never done web-based work (other than actually designing pages and buttons in Illustrator - and then having someone else doing the converting, assembly etc.)  so I decided to buy a book and have a go. To get straight to the point this book is a piece of crap for the following reasons. 1) (despite professing otherwise) It is totally incoherent, and follows a very illogical progression pattern. 2) The grafiks are so sadly outdated and amateur-ish I cringed every time I opened the book. 3) It fails to empower the reader to move freely and thus visualise their own ideas. 4) It is VERY incomprehensive. 5) It is very hard to navigate, has no real index, no thumb tags etc. It is like a 'Big Mac' - it looks yummy and filling and when you take a bite it SEEMS to fill you up, but soon you are hungry for more REAL FOOD. My advice? Go for a less disturbingly 'visual' format that provides you with the building blocks to build your own house 
 The text is a decent introduction to the basics of Biblical criticism and is fairly readable for first-time students in the field. That said, the author is given to overstatement of his case, often failing to recognize that the theories he espouses also have had some criticisms by other scholars. This leaves open the very real possibility of biasing new students against other theories prevalent in the field without giving them an option of weighing the evidence for themselves. So it's good, only as long as you remember that what is reported in many cases is simply the opinion of the author. (As a rule, whenever somebody says "modern scholars say", look to the evidence they provide, not the blatant appeal to authority). 
 I'm sorry, but this album is simply not good. Anyone who thinks it is is just blinded by the trendiness of Stephen Merritt and his clicky crew. I can't think of one song that is even remotely close to the greatness of most of the songs on the last 6ths album. These are uninspired songs written by a bored musician. Remember those catchy pop songs on Wasps' Nest? or Holiday? well, kiss those goodbye cuz there are none here. What you get now are 14 heartless, boring, and thoughtless tracks. I recommend you skip this one 
 Not very readable, didn't find it interesting, after going through the first part of the book i put it somewhere and never bothered to completely read it 
 If you are already familiar with the idea of cooking for a day, and eating for a week or month, then you will likely be disappointed with this bland and boring cookbook.  The best recipes in it are uninspired versions of spaghetti sauce, chili, and casseroles.  These are all concoctions that you probably already have recipes for, and could just double and freeze.  This cookbook also needs serious editing.  The author repeats recipes in several sections, and often has inaccurate measurements for her ingredients.  Save yourself some money and buy a traditional cookbook instead.    
 This is NOT a book!! It is a fold of about 25 half-size pages stapled in the center with a cover of card stock printed in black.  The information was totally ho-hum.  Common sense and an IQ of more than 20 will give you the same information with a quick look at the front of any book.  Then there's the cost!!!!!  $15.95 plus $3.49 shipping.  The book would have easily fit into a #10 business envelope and shipped for forty cents.  Needless to say I returned it ASAP 
 I am use to a choreographed pilates dvd or class and based on the fact that this instructor is the "first lady of pilates", I expected it to be a great DVD.  The instructor walks through every motion and they do about 2 body band motions and then move on to the next.  It is a constant stop and start.  This has nothing to do with body sculpting.  It may be more of a stretch tape for a 200 year old women but for this being a 3 on a scale of 5 for difficulty, I expected a lot more. I would never recommend this DVD. 
 This is, without a doubt, the worst investment I have made so far.  The grammar and punctuation is deplorable, and the information is next to useless.  There are infinitely better sources for anyone looking for information on how to start a small business.  I would have given it a rating of less than one star had one been available.  Save your time and money 
 I have been a Nickatina fan ever since The New Jim Jones had its record release when he was down with IMP and Totally Insane, so I think I can truly say that Nicky is falling off slowly but surely.  Raven In My Eye (Cocain Raps Vol. 1) was no joke and had countless tight tracks.  He then followed up that CD with Tears of A Clown which didn't have as many songs as I would have liked, but all of them were quality.  The beats were the sickest he's ever had...and his lyrics were clever and on point as always.  However...as soon as Daiquiri Factory hit...I was a little disappointed.  Some of the songs on the album (Alphabet Soup for instance) had NO business on a professionaly pressed CD.  There were some highlights though...but for the most part, his beats got more and more abstract to the point where I'm not even feeling them anymore.  But now...he comes back with These R the Tales which is by far his most abstract album yet.  Apart from I Saw A Gangsta Cry...I don't think there was a song on the entire album when I didn't say to myself, "I think Dre has finally smoked one chewy too many."  I might even have to sleep on his next album (or cop it online).  Hopefully he will get back to some of the concepts that made him so raw in the past like...Scottie 15, Wack MCs, Smoke Dope and Rap, I'm A Pieces and so many more 
 All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over.  
 I came to this book with high hopes.     The title, "On Being A Pagan" was exactly what I wanted to read, and de Benoist is a respected Pagan author.   I wanted to learn about Paganism and the experience of being a Pagan.  Sadly, I was disappointed on two counts.    First of all the title seems to be somewhat misnamed, as the book seemed to me to be much more an explanation of Judeo-Christian ideas and doctrine, than an exposition on Paganism !    Every chapter seems to go, in depth, into the ideas behind Judeo-Christian concepts of God, rather than giving me an insight into Paganism.   I found this so frustrating that I gave up on the book after a hundred pages, having had a brief scan of the rest and seen that it seemed to deal with similar themes all the way through.    I was disappointed on a second count, because de Benoist's writing is opaque in the extreme and very difficult to follow.   I am accustomed to academic texts, having attended University and gained an honours degree in Psychology.   Despite that, and a deep interest in the subject of the title, I found de Benoist's reasoning extremely difficult to follow, and lacking in coherence.   It was also severely lacking in charisma.     The first problem I had with the book is definitely down to de Benoist himself, as he decided what he was going to write about, and how he would tackle the subject.   The difficulty of the text, and it's lack of charisma may (or may not) be down to the translator, Jon Graham.     Unless you are studying the subject for a PhD thesis, I would leave this book alone.    It is hard (in my case, impossible !) to read and seems to me not to address the subject proclaimed in the title.   A true disappointment. 
  It made my skin very dry and break out because of it. My floormate had the same reaction. We were both very disappointed.  I recommend going for VitaClear which i tried before this product and is less expensive than ProActiv although it is a little more expensive than this.  
 Although I am not a veterinarian, I have worked in an animal hospital for two years.  First of all, according to our medical practice, this book gives some bad nurishment advice!  Milk (and milk products such as cream and half & half) are NOT a good food for many cats.  Their systems are often not equipped to digest the enzymes found in cows' milk.  Having said what was foremost on my mind, I am also very disappointed in the "behavior" advice from this author.  I found very little information on kittens.....and almost nothing useful (which is why I purchased this book in the first place!).  In fact, I absolutely disagree with Ms. Wilbourn's suggestions about introducing a new kitten into an adult cat home.  From the new kitten arriving via "escort" to you (as the responsible owner) and leaving the new kitten to fend for itself all afternoon, as your adult cat "takes care of himself and his kitten".  What dangerous nonsense this is!  Stop and think.....what a 10 lb. adult could do to a 2 lb. kitten, if so inclined?  Perhaps the cats in Manhatten are far more anthropomorphisized (as opposed to Ms. Wilbourn's coined word "catsonality") then the felines with which the rest of us are familiar?  For the record, I currently have a terrific 15 year old, as well as a very feisty 4 month old.  I should have seen warning signs when this 224 page (LARGE print book) began with a 19 page forward.  No doubt this forward is intended to demonstrate Ms. Wilbourn's considerable knowledge.  Sorry, it doesn't.  Bottom line?  Save your money and try another author....preferably someone with the letters D.V.M after his or her name 
 Here are Barrett's major points, (with my comments):1/the USDA Food Guide Pyramid is all you need. (Really, then why has the pyramid been changed so many times? Have our needs as a species changed?) 2/ Following the US Dietary Guidelines will prevent all deficiencies.(By it's -own- standards, yes. Should one organization decide both the requirements -and- judge the results? The only thing that could possibly make them wrong would be for them to admit it. Not likely. It's a self-monitoring agency..not a good thing. 3/All vitamin companies are liars. (Some are, some aren't, just like any group. You're a psychiatrist, how honest did  Freud  turn out to be?) 4/Stress causes the symptoms that are attributed to poor diet. (A psychiatrist would think that, of course. Aside from that, says who?  A 25-year-long suppressed government paper states that nutritional deficencies are the #1 cause of health problems. ) 5/Milled out B vitamins are put back with enrichment.(Sounds like adding VITAMINS to me, I thought you were against that. And how do you replace nutrients that science hasn't discovered yet?) 6/Only a few vitamins are sensitive to heat.(Only a few? I guess too few to matter?)7/Minerals are not destroyed by cooking. (Correct, but they are -altered-, and that can't be a good thing, assuming they were in the correct form in the first place.) 8/Additives aren't proven to cause problems.(Very close to proven, Doc. I don't want to die to prove it. The agencies in charge of safety don't have the time,resources, inclination, or even the legal right to check -every- ingredient thoroughly, and the synergy of combined ingredients isn't even something they -attempt- to test. The -government- must prove an ingredient is -unsafe-; it's -not- the duty of the manufacturer to prove that it -is- safe. Is -that- really safe?) 9/Fluoride is good. (There is so much detailed evidence against fluoride that I accuse any proponent of collusion with the industry.) 10/Small doses of pesticides are no problem. (How small, and who's measuring? Even if this is possibly true for the few poisons that break down quickly, it is absolutely untrue for poisons that remain intact and accumulate over one's lifetime; small now is big later.  This has been  proven to be an especially -deadly- lie when synergy of poisons sometimes increase their toxicity a -thousand- times over). There's plenty more,  of course. I believe Barrett knows where his bread is buttered. Corporate criminals need confederates in medicine to make the machine work...Doesn't psychiatry have a bad enough reputation already? This book would be  joke if it weren't so dangerous./// For a truer look at the modern world's effect on our health, read _The Hundred Year Lie_, by Randall Fitzgerald. The author is not an advocate of the  typical health food products, (which are often  just as filled with unlabeled additives as the 'foods' Barrett defends), but convincingly, debunks  Barrett's claims for the safety of government approved additives to , and manipulations of our food supply.///    
 These old movies are best kept in your memory.  When you rewatch them, it becomes so clear that they're like ancient history.  Weirdly, 1960's movies are more dated than those of the 1920's.  What was going on in that decade that caused people to make heroes of anti-heroes that are litttle more than dirty criminals?  The only redeeming part of the film is the setting in the Cajon Pass before the rampage of urbanization that is quickly destroying it 
 Extremely disappointed in the video quality. Looks like it was shot with a 16mm camera from the balcony not a DVD.  Returned this immediately.  How could Kultur release something like this 
 Babyface sued singer Anita Baker for allegedly failing to pay him for a song he produced for her. He filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against fellow R&B artist Anita Baker alleging she owes him at least $250,000. Babyface co-wrote and produced the incredible song "Like You Used to Do,".   It's kinda hard to beleive this, but it seems Anita decided to con her producer even if the album went gold with 500,000 sold copies. I purchased this CD because I had heard about this duet with Babyface and "Like You Used to Do" is the best track on the album. 
 Amy and Leon do quite a job with traditional texts. It is not an accident that the only evidence for such absurd moral values is found in ancient texts. Ancient texts provide excellent material for modern sociological studies. Fantastic, really. If you take your bearings from the Kasses' book, I would suggest to you that you check out First Things "the Journal of Religion and Public Life" and read about the many reasons women should remain demure, submissive and concern themselves above all with finding and keeping an attractive husband. Mmmmmm. God, like Homer works in mysterious ways 
 As a Brit and an avid "Vicar" fan, I was very disappointed in the 10th anniversary special.  Generally, it has lost its clever innocence and wackiness and Alice is far too self aware as an actor.  She's also lost her naive sweetness.  It just wasn't funny and bears none of its original surprise and appeal.  Having said that, I watch the series over and over again--it's brilliant!  
 I picked this book out of desperation for something to entertain me while on vacation.  The book did not grab my attention at first, but at least the premise sounded plausible.  However, as the plot unfolded, it grew more outlandish by the page.  Mr. Rollins clearly does not have a good grasp of technology and science and therefore should refrain from writing about those topics. He is no Michael Crichton.  He falls back on the lazy plot device of a supercomputer with artificial intelligence to fill gaps in his story.  It is so convenient to ask the computer to do any task or find any information much like snapping your fingers or rubbing Aladdin's lamp.  The climax was just plain dumb and made me angry.  Skip this stinker 
 I described this novel to a friend as a mediocre novel that finally took a turn for the worse.  I kept hoping it would get better.  Each part, however, went further and further south.  Part 3, was ultimately, it's demise.  It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Not the original, engaging Twilight Zone, but the new and contrived Twilight Zone.    With all of the great literature out there, this was a waste of my time 
 Purchased this book because the Table of Contents under Browse Sample Pages showed the full content of the book.  However, the Harriman House Classics hardcover edition only has three of the chapters. 
 A lot of repetitious platitudes about the philosophy (feminine viewpoint) of writing blogs.  Very little on how to do it.  Where do I get blogging software?  How about some reviews of blogging software? How do I set up a blog web site?  How do I set up "RSS feed"?.  Or for that matter why do I want an "RSS Feed"?  I'm not a dummy or a complete idiot since I do maintain some web sites and can write JSP, Java Script, and am reasonably adept with Dreamweaver.  I also passed three English courses at a presitgious university.  So If I can't write, it's my own fault.  But I sure cannot do a blog without more information than I gained from this book.  
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either.  Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals.  Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie 
 These authors deserve far more than two stars, but the misleading title doesn't.  Buy this book only if you're looking for collections of great poetry/essays; you'll find very few novels/novel segments in here.  
 Not worth the $10 I paid especially when I had to spend $7 to ship it !! 
 I very much wanted to buy this book, and read the pages available through the "Look Inside" section on the Amazon page. (I didn't want to give the book a star rating, but Amazon's system forced this upon me.) I personally would be unable to bear the translator's chosen staccato-like rendering, and wonder if the  original version has been effectively ruined. For this reason I am not, with regret, buying the book 
 I had to buy this book for a college course that I was taking. I suspect that the only people buying this book are those who must do so in order to pass a college course. This book is trite, cliche-ridden and not at all objective. Bederman is to the far left of the political spectrum and her politics are found all throughout this book. I've learned virtually nothing new from reading the cliches that Bederman merely repeats in this book. Bederman wouldn't know an original idea if one fell on her 
 Was very disappointed by the performance of this unit.  Not enough pressure.  Pretty useless even with new batteries 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 The book suggests that it will provide 16 paths to bulding wealth, one for each Myers-Briggs type. Unfortunately it does not do so. For mine, what the book refers to as a visionary or INTP, it says instead, to forget building weath because "money is not why Visionaries are here in this lifetime". "Use your talents" is the only suggestion. Maybe others are better, but it appears to use most of its pages to discuss psychology and spends little time prescribing financial strategies 
 I ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed, the 11 medium that I received was probably as wide as any EEE width I have seen, and whats worse -these just sort of look cheap.  I returned them, and I will avoid buying this brand agai 
 While the underlying plot had potential, the story dies under its own weight.  There are too many characters (the first hint of trouble is the multi-page listing of characters at the front of the book).  This leads to too little time devoted to character development and too much bouncing around as we follow the many characters around the globe.  The dialog, is terse, contrived, choppy and generally devoid of emotion.  Having loved the Dirk Pitt and Brad Austin line of books from Cussler, I had wanted to like the Oregon Files as well.  Unfortunately, I found Sacred Stone and Golden Buddha to both be underwhelming.  
 Barrow, of anthropic cosmological principle fame, undertakes to examine the logical, practical, and psychological limits to human [scientific] knowledge. The result is a sometimes interesting, but more often disappointing exposition in the history of science and of philosophy. In a volume that is essentially a philosophical treatise, we find that even Cambridge mathematicians can expound rather sloppy logic, actually evidencing the limits imposed on human investigations by human psychological encumbrances (one of the author's themes). The author's first chapter consideration of visual and linguistic paradoxes features a feeble apologia for agnosticism, which employs a linguistic paradox as an argument against the existence of an omniscient being. Barrow, who seems to be fairly well studied in philosophy, should know that Augustine decisively trashed this type of argument 1600 years ago for reasons that seem apparent in Barrow's own choice of language. [Barrow's cited paradox attests merely that no finite being can know everything. Further, a variation of the paradox attests that no one could ever know that an omniscient being does not exist.] In the second chapter, discussing the limits of the human mind revealed by Immanuel Kant, Barrow states that we understand these problems "as Kant did not" to be explained by natural selection. Natural selection is, of course, a tautological proposition (stating that if gene a is more likely to succeed than gene b, then gene a is more likely to succeed than gene b). As Kant explained, and as any student of logic knows, a tautology explains nothing. Given Barrow's skeptical consideration of various other attempts at explanation, his non-analytical and repetitive alighting on this sacrosanct tautology is unfortunate. Barrow's opening fusillades here may be his weakest, but it doesn't get a great deal better. There are some discussions that I did enjoy: the author's consideration of selective as opposed to absolute limits; and his [re]visitation of a few of the fundamental 'coincidences' contributing to the anthropic principle (chapter 5). Barrow's consideration of the human mind ("What are minds for?", chapter 4) is essentially useless. His conclusions (chapters 8 and 9) are interesting but don't warrant reading the entire book to reach them: "If this book has taught the reader anything, I hope that the notion of impossibility is far subtler than nave assumptions ... would lead you to believe." Likely, this is one of John Barrow's weakest efforts. To the reader interested in the interplay of physics and philosophy I recommend Paul Davies' The Mind of God. For the reader who is interested in logic, this book may suffice as a brief introduction to the idea of limit and to Gdel's Incompleteness Theorem. Reading Immanuel Kant, one of the most finely disciplined minds in analytic history, would be of greater value, as would be a good epistemology text. Pass on this one 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 OF NO USE TO ME .......A WASTE OF MONEY...LOVE THE QUILTS ... CAMPANIAN BOOK OF NO USE TO ME.....THANK YOU JOAN 
 'Advances in Agronomy, Volume 73', left me bewildered. Nowhere in the text did I find reference to the well-researched fact that those who practice agronomy, and who have been convicted of it, are usually recidivists who can never be rehabilitated. So therefore, how has the topic been advanced? Society should be protected from agronomists and their vile deeds. I might sound harsh, but I say that all agronomists should be locked up for life and rendered hormonally inert through the administration of impulse-destroying chemicals. 
 This is literally the ONLY Prince album that gets less than three stars from me, y'all. I love the man an' his eccentric genius, but the material here was just not hittin' for me. It's flawlessly performed as all his work is (the man is the most sheer perfectionist in the biz, which makes his incredibly-prolific output all the more impressive an' mind-blowing), but, in spite of it all, this one jus' left me flat an' uninspired. The stabs at electro-rock an' rap on 'Loose' an' 'Race' respectively jus' don't do it for me on this outing (the latter topic he tackled to much better effect on his next effort in the form of 'We March') an' even a slower ballad like 'Space', while technically well-crafted, lacks the real SOUL to get you enthusiastic about it. This album's definitely dark as others have mentioned an' not for mainstream appeal, but thas' NOT why I don't really like it (y'all should know me by now!). And as I keep stressing its flawlessly-performed. My disappointment is in the sheer BLANDNESS of its perfection. (Yea, so maybe that doesn't make sense, but it sounded good in my head, so I'm stickin' with it!)      There are however two tittilating numbers on here that make this almost worth having. The grandiose epic title track 'Come' for those "18 an' over", is a slinky 10-minute-plus groove with a hypnotic horn-and-rhythm section. The other is the searing story of parental abuse an' neglect he tells on 'Papa'. Prince has the amazing ability to find new ways to sum up life an' mankind in general with jus' a couple lines, an' he does this on jus' about every album, even the lesser ones like this one. Here on 'Papa' he gives us words to live by: "Fair to partly crazy, deep down we're all the same, Every single one of us knows some kind of pain." 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 Part of the value of books on photoshop, particularly ones about digital photography, is in showing you how to take reasonable shots and make them better. In these examples the photos start bad and sometimes get worse. The problem is visible even on the cover. The photoshopped flag looks awful.  Definitely not the book for digital photographers looking to get the most out of photoshop. I recommend O'Reilly's Digital Photography: Expert Techniques instead 
 I own a ton of workout dvd's and thought I might try this one due to the ten minute interval toning sections. I like to use these as add-ons to my cardio vids.  However, I tried the entire video twice and could not get over the instructor... her chatter was really annoying and I felt like she was teaching a kindergarten class.  I am not easily annoyed, and was surprised by my dislike of this dvd... I am definitely selling this one on ebay 
 Julia Glass buried her finely designed characters in excessive, useless words.  A discard.  Not National Book Award Material 
 First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look.  But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot.  In other words, the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot, and caused blisters.  I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them, the "leather" will soften up and become easier to wear 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 The Rocketeer is the cinematic version of all the faux-Deco buildings that have been erected in recent years around Los Angeles, particularly the Miracle Mile area. It's wafer-thin nostalgia masks a chintzy story that can't stand on its own two feet.  The plotting of The Rocketeer is sound enough for adolescent fare. Unfortunately, the characters are totally uninspired and the dialogue atrocious. Worse still is the execution of the material. Every actor is miscast and thoroughly lacking in charisma. Bill Campbell -- ever hear of him anymore? He overacts every single scene. Timothy Dalton? Hammy. Jennifer Connelly is the only one to come out unscathed.   The direction is beyond weak. When The Rocketeer appears at the nightclub it is so poorly staged, so cloyingly "goofy" that it extinguishes the promise of anything remotely thrilling from happening. Add to this foul mixture a horrendous James Horner score... you get the idea. Still, some nice set design and an effective animated film-within-a-film make for a couple high points. 
 Kaiser Chiefs are a load of wannabe rockers DO NOT BUY THIS buy Led Zeppelin or AC DC but please not this 
 The FBI could not have created a better person to sow the seeds of destruction for the Black Panther Party than Eldridge Cleaver.   The treatise from jail - before Cleaver became a BPP member - catapulted him into the 1960s revolutionary/black power movements. But his so-called consciousness was never for the greater good of the whole.  Cleaver failed to gain control of the BPP during his time in exile - and when he was essentially booted out of Cuba - by making what he felt was a left-turn by placing the organization into solidarity with nation's "at war" with U.S. imperialism. The attempted coup was foiled when Huey Newton kicked Cleaver and his followers out of the party. But Cleaver sounded so good when barking out orders thousands of miles away!  The split began the fragmentation of the party. I contend it was the cornerstone development for the U.S. government to manipulate as a means to destroy the party from within. And I still have questions concerning the police shoot-out where Cleaver emerged basically unscathed, but his comrade in arms was shot dead.  Cleaver - a convicted rapist - was legendary for his physical/verbal abuse of women. Again, the sickening spector of control through intimidation.   It should have come as no surprise to anyone that years later Cleaver made an abrupt political turn into a right-extremist camp. He feared not being the head of the game, and with no place to turn on the left, Cleaver scampered to the right in hopes his new friends would pick him as captain of the team.  As a slice of American History, Soul On Ice remains an essential read. But Cleaver's ideology cut severe wounds in the BPP, caused death and dissension, while arguably driving Newton into consolidating a national party into one Oakland chapter.   Cleaver a revolutionary? Hardly. An egotistical coward? Yes.    
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 As we know, neuroscientists are attempting to ascertain the neural pathways of thought. Well and good ... or is it? The propositions relating to consciousness ... innate, phenomenal, neurobiological, or a combination of all the above ... have historically come within the ideational purview of philosophers. But now, from concepts that are arguably the creative property of philosophers, neuroscientists are seeking to expand their understanding of thought through experimental, physiological models of the experiential process using nonhuman primates as subjects. How are we to understand innate knowledge (that which exists in the mind without having been derived from previous experience), a priori, phenomenal, or even what can be considered epiphenomenal knowledge, and consciousness in general, by basing the existence of that knowledge on experiential studies utilizing traditional (animal model) investigational methods? This is a trial design paradigm concocted of fallacious reasoning. But the worst part is that the human experimenters do not suffer ... only the voiceless monkeys and apes in cages. Finding the single neuron, or domain of neurons firing that might create the visual image related to experience would be an exciting triumph for some, but please consider, at what cost?  And the work goes on. It goes on behind closed doors in medical school facilities and other institutions of physiological and psychological research where the vivisection is out of sight and out of mind of the general public. These studies will not give us the answers the scientists are seeking. Brain imaging studies are one thing, as they are relatively noninvasive, but still, the intelligent arboreal animals must usually be confined to a small, metal cage; and when being examined or "worked-on" they are clamped and secured to a table. I am a veterinarian, and I have worked as a rehabilitation specialist with many species of wildlife. One important lesson I have learned is that all wildlife species belong in the wild; they are not pets, and many zoos still do not provide proper care. But certainly, these intelligent animals should not be used for this kind of biological research. They are alive and conscious and feeling, so much more so than the average Homo sapiens physiological researcher will attempt to understand. The primates I have been involved with have a very special look in their eyes that tells of their inner turmoil, and the nonhuman beings I have worked with who have come from research laboratories are remote, fearful beyond belief, and often psychotic. Frequently, their bodies are scarred, from both their hellish journey through research programs, and by self-mutilation. And they were slaves to who, and for what? Finding the elusive and faddish NCC is interesting and intriguing, perhaps too much so, but methods must be found that limit experimental animal suffering.   How many simian slaves, whether Chimpanzees, Macaques, Capuchins, Baboons, or Owl Monkeys will once again have to be bound to "the table" or other cold metallic restraining device, or anything that completely restricts movement, and subjected to the painful, humiliating anguish of 19th-Century-Style vivisection.  In that, I mean cruel, unprincipled, and unethical tortures, such as, having their eyes implanted with electrodes or ablated, their bodies burned with lasers or given electrical shock to determine pain receptors, or their reproductive organs surgically opened and closed a hundred times, or their skulls sawed or punctured by trephination and their brain tissue cut on with portions surgically excised, or their cerebral hemispheres split, or their craniums drilled so that infectious agents can be directly administered to their nervous tissue, or their small heads bashed with hammers to simulate cranial injury, or their backs broken to simulate spinal cord injury, or now, with the "new" cognitive sciences (that alluring quest for the NCC), their brains implanted with dozens, if not hundreds or thousands of electrodes, just so that neurobiologists can pad their research bank roles, write books, and see their academic reputations underpinned by their scientific handiwork? And I can just imagine the philosophers who support this vivisection standing triumphantly in the background, nodding their heads, and saying, "You see, I was right all along!"   Biotic diversity is a gift; and bioethics must play a role. Ah yes ... but then there is the issue of the advancement of science.   Go, Go, Go, Dr. Moreau!   As long as the investigators get the answers they seek (which they won't), for questions they are asking (which, ultimately, have no definable or definitive answers), no need to worry about animal suffering. Right? Wrong!   There are still many mysteries about life, and often, the more we know the less we truly know. And whether consciousness is part corporeal and part metaphysical, phenomenal, or something, as an entity, belonging to an unknown (unknowable?) reality, the time has come for more serious considerations of our ETHICAL obligations to our fellow creatures, and especially our biological cousins here on planet Earth. I am sure the authors are, themselves, dedicated scientists seeking answers to what they consider legitimate inquires into the nature of consciousness, the nature of self, and of Nature. But I have seen some of the experimental designs and research methods that are now being employed for the questionable experiments being conducted, or, are in the planning stages for further work. Based on this, it is assured that more animals, primarily nonhuman primates, will continue to endure the fear and pain of being "subjects" for the advancement of human understanding. For this work, a method must be found that reduces, limits, or as a best alternative, "eliminates" all animal suffering. In the 21st Century, can we please move beyond our past mistakes? Perhaps the most sensible (wise?) choice for understanding consciousness is to appeal to the wisdom and creativity of our philosophers. Human consciousness is unquestionably unique in the animal kingdom, but Homo sapiens are not the only animals that think, dream, or feel pain, joy, or sorrow. So, let it be our "minds" that understand "our" minds, as best as this can be accomplished, and let's keep our primate friends swinging from the branches and foraging quietly on the grassy plain, free and happy.  
 this is by far one of the worst heavy metal albums i have heard comeout in the last year, no wait five years, no better make that ten years.  way overated band who suck live.  the only band they played after was gojira who are from france.  and even they sounded better 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 I read a lot of books about motherhood before I had my son, while I was trying to figure out whether it would be really worth it. (ie., Is it as great as mothers always say it is, or are they just trying to bring happy motherless women into the baby pit with them?) I am still interested in reading about motherhood even though I have taken the plunge because I am still interested in finding words that describe the experience accurately. (It really IS wonderful but it sort of consumes you too.) Reviews seemed to indicate that this book had a revealing confessional honesty but I didn't find anything new here and it wasn't particulary well written. Anne Lamott's "Operating Instructions - Diary of My Son's First Year" contains many more "Yes! So true." moments and is more funny, and touching and beautifully written. To put it more succinctly, I laughed and bawled several times while reading "Operating Instructions" but this was kind of a bore. 
 We bought this book for our 2 year old daughter, and even I had trouble putting the valentines into the slots.  The valentine was not very durable, and was starting to rip already after the first time we read it together.  I was very disappointed and returned the book.  It was not up to Sesame Street standards.  Try "Elmo Loves You" instead 
 I am a huge fan of Enigma and have all four of their previous albums, which are absolutely excellent.  This is why I was so disappointed with this one.  It is random and directionless and much of it sounds like individual band members tuning up.  The entire album is pervaded by a supremely annoying, harsh, distorted electronic sound that grates on the ears.  It seems to me that in this music Michael Cretu has become a modern-day German full of Angst and self pity that no one could care less about.  Boredom and annoyance are the two lasting impressions of this album 
 I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.   It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.  Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on.   Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.  Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.  Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".)   It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.   This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.   A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.  On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her.   As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.  These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.   Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.   It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.   So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.  There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.   I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.  For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not. 
 This is the worst contempory romance book i have read. The beginning is promising with its opening scene, but from there on its all down hill.  The male protagonist is a likeable character, but as it seems with all of Chris Manby's book the female are either weak, shallow or compleatly stupid!!!!  It does not portray women in the best of lights, and the storyline plods on abysmally, you spend more time reading about the life of the monkies than the romance between the two central characters.   Manby's lead female roles are a poor man's Bridget Jones, and her books seem to follow the same path and sadly the novelty is wearing a little thin.  All i can say is don't waste your day reading this book, i wish i could get back my valuable time!!!!! I would suggest reading Aint she sweet by Susan Elizabeth Philips or Playing James by Sarah Mason 
 I bought this based on Patricia's review and loved it for the first month, then noticed it making a strange sqeaking noise.  Upon closer inspection I noticed multiple welds breaking (I'm 185 lbs).  Now I'm not so happy with it, no warrenty, Amazon won't take it back.  Good thing I have a friend with a wire welder who can fix it for me 
 The book starts off decent, then becomes useless dribble, How a ghost hunter can believe in ghosts and then proceed to say that all spirit communication is the work of satan and evil demons is pure nonsense, discarnate humans show up fo his amusement but only demons show up for Spiritualist seances, pure junk ! he also attacts the occult sciences as means for demon obsession, and claims Witchcraft is the work of the devil, what is this guy doing living in the 13 century ? or just spotting off christian bigotry ? oh, and by the way, going to cemetaries to look for ghosts is like going to candy stores looking for sugar, get real, either ghosts exist or they don't, oh, I also liked the way he sumed up psychics as useless con men. it just proves that any one can write a book and claim to be an expert.need I say more ?  don't waste your money 
 As everyone else has said, this product is not at all what it should be.  It slows down the internet browsing to a crawl (my laptop that has crashed several times, is several years older and runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer with McAfee).  You can't close it, as others have said, other than uninstalling.  The funniest part I've found, however, is that it warns you the first time it tries to access.  Being amused, I refused the program permission to update itself.  Other than removing the program, it was the best thing I did using McAfee 
 Maybe I expect too much from an old Wurlitzer but I don't remember the snare drums being so distorted in real life as they are on this CD. Almost like there was some kind of a frequency clipper on the microphone(s) or maybe they were in the wrong place and were overloaded. Whatever the reason I think this CD needs to be remastered (or something) to fix this problem before it can be truly enjoyable. I note also a similar comment about the Volume II CD 
   This is one of the most embarrassing books I've ever read.    It has absolutely no meaningful advice to give, and certainly nothing approaching knowledge, let alone 'wisdom.'  I was curious what life coaching was all about.  I thought the idea of motivating people towards their goals sounded intriguing.  I still believe it might have some potential.  But that potential is not to be found in Curly Martin's woeful treatise.  Each chapter starts and ends with a summary.  Both are paltry, unenlightening, and just repeat exactly what's in between.  This book is largely about salesmanship.  The reader gets the sinking feeling that tricking the customer into buying services is somehow essential to the customer's well-being.  Disturbing!  If you really have something to sell, do you have to concentrate so much on salesmanship?  A lot of the book emphasizes the power of positive thinking.  Martin suggests actually telling clients to lie to themselves, to tell themselves things that they know to be false, in order to *make* this new belief come true.  This seems a long way from changing oneself or one's life.  The rest is just a hodgepodge of half-baked observations dressed up to sound pseudo-deep.  For instance...  *  The "advanced" skills are things like:  the glass is half full, not half empty.  *  "Representational systems" means that some clients are visual and respond well to visual language.  *  "Spiral coaching" teaches you that clients are red, purple, blue or some other color/personality type.  You're better off with astrology or Freudian neuroses--or not, it matters little.  *  Some of the 'models' involved tell you to be vague so the client will think you're saying more than you are!  In short, this is mercenary charlatanism wearing the mantle of not terribly deep pseudo-science.  I returned this book.  If you want half-baked junk non-science, this is the book for you!  --E. R. O'Neil 
 My 10-month old babies have no interest in this book, and they love board books 
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 Bishop Spong is very interesting, instead of attacking conservatives he attacks Christ Himself.  The sad thing is for all the good points he has unless you reimagine faith (or lack of faith) like him, you can easily discount his ideas and some of the true things he says.  He is an important figure, not because of his scholarship which is laughable... he is important because he does prompt discussion and challenges the complacent. 
 This book was awful.  I forced myself to finish it because I did not feel right claiming it was the worst book I'd ever read if I had not finished it.  It was a gift, and I was not aware if was the third book in a series (perhaps the cover should be more clear on this matter).  Reading the other books would probably have made some of the confusing parts less so, however the book would still have been awful.  I kept waiting for the author to tie everything together and get to some point or conculsion that he never did.  It reads as if he just stopped writing.  The story was not entertaining in the least with the plot bouncing around all over the place.  I don't claim to be an intellectual so perhaps this book was not meant for me.  If like to be confused and puzzel out books from the first page, read this. Otherwise, I would advise you to take a pass on this one 
 When I first read this book, I could not help but wonder why the author  sounded so angry! The entire text could have been written in 20 pages, but  tends to drag on monotonously, repeating statements many times in the same  aggressive tone.  The tone and repetition of the text tends to lead you  away from the few morsels of interesting and useful information, such as  the wonderfully concise overview of basic chinese medicine that even a lay  person could understand.  It is such a shame that this book was so horribly  written with it's truly advanced use of the English language, that it is  difficult to follow, understand, and even pick up again to finish.  This is  no light reading, folks 
 This book does not provide any information that could not be found in a college level textbook. The assumptions and examples provided in the book are over simplified. If you are anything higher than a junior accountant I would suggest you purchase something else. Calling this book a "Controller's Guide" is just plain wrong 
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
 Another Christian who think that liberal platitudes straight out of The New Republic are some how mandated by the faith.  Too bad 
 Even though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman."  I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).  Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.  Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.  Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.   The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly. 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 Clipped, petite and looking more like a leather bar Anne Murray, Crow drags out the hits and the `friends' for this all-star live bash. Half the album is standard issue and straight ahead stage sweat with the morning beer-buzz afficiando going it alone without a little help from her friends (All I Wanna Do, Everyday Is a Winding Road, A Change Would Do You Good, Leaving Las Vegas). With only slight variations on these overplayed originals (a sychopantic crowd and some tinkering with the rhythms) Crow's solo chores rarely rate more than a grudging ho-hum. The rest of the album is a parade of snap-on tools (Dixie Chicks, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Sarah McLachlan, Chrissie Hynde) who easily steal the spotlight from their downhome hash-slinging waitress/host. Reduced to the role of supporting guitarist, Crow butters the toast from the sidelines as femme contemporaries like Nicks (who unravels admirably on Gold Dust Woman), Hynde and McLachlan flounder about the mike in a haphazard hit (Hynde's If It Makes You Happy)-and-miss (McLachlan's The Difficult Kind) headbutt at Crow's hits. But it isn't until Clapton's suspendered, cigar-chomping husk is rolled out to update Cream's White Room that the sour stench of monstrous micalculation reaches it's devastating climax. Fresh from watering the daisies and still in his jammies, Clapton's return to the electric psychedelics of his Paleolithic past  is a fumbling bumbling fiasco unleashed with the grace and finesse of a diarrhetic Brontosaurus. It's horrifying to think that this is what Cream would have sounded like if they hadn't broken up. Thank God for egos. It's almost a relief to hear Richards mindlessly croak his way through the old Stones Exile-era toss-off Happy, as if a cadaverous ex-junkie with the durability of a cockroach and nine lives would be anything but. Besides, Richards provides wonderful comic relief and criticizing his artistic capacity is as futile as pointing out the flaws in the bandages on an Egyptian mummy. The wrapper finds the entire gang, from Spanky Nicks to Buckwheat Clapton, joining hands for a bizarre entreaty with a kindergarten  rendition of Dylan's Tombstone Blues - a fitting finale if there ever was one 
 Well, the new census just came out and yet again tells us that Europe is dying, soon death rates will exceed the birth rates in places where they haven't already begun this trend. Italian women have an average of one baby and Germany's maternity wards sit empty more often than not. Native Irish are projected to be a minority in their own country no later than 2050. Racial strife and violence has already rocked England, due to out of control multiculturalism.  This disturbing trend has appeared here in America as well, with Whites consistently being outbred by foreigners, not to mention the lax border control policies our government has (or has not) implemented. The funny thing is that a lot of Whites seem completely unconcerned about the future of their children and grandchildren. Europe is undoubtedly a White person's birthright, and should be for Whites only, just as Asia and Africa is for Asians and blacks. Here in America, where this demographic suicide is also occuring, we will become a third world country within the next 50 years. Balkanization will happen and racial violence (South Africa for example) will be much more common.  Executions of Whites and interracial rapes will become more common as we plunge into minority status- they say 50% of the population by 2050, and what next? How low can we go?  Would Whites be alarmed when the census comes out with a 5% projection? Where does the annihilation of our people end?  The author of this book would no doubt be shocked by the disappearance of a beautiful butterfly, sea lions or the St. Bernard dog but could not care in the least to see White children continue to exist and thrive in a safe first world country.  -A female White Nationalist    
 The typical analysis of each style is presented in a three entry table which makes impossible to formulate a basic style recipe from the table (grain type, proportion and incidence over a number of recipes).  Is hard to figure out a basic recipe from the style discussion and tables. Therefore,the author added half page at the end of each chapter telling you how to brew each particular style. 
 In the right hands this novel could be translated into an exciting movie.  The premise is interesting, but falls completely flat with the sewn up ending.  A true happily ever after, that begs for a more smartly written sequel in which everything unravels would be delicious.  The hardest aspect to swallow was that this super extra terrestrial life form could divide out of control then just be neatly killed and carried to a lab in the desert for benevolent study.  Sheesh!  I really thought it was going to get scary at some point! The major antagonist of the story is a tattoed up ex inmate who fancies himself a master mind killer-when in reality he is just a sharpshooting (except when it really counts) boob!  And boy does he meet his match in a simple pair of desert folk, who happen to be expert gunslingers and survivalists to boot!  This is all very funny, but to me the funniest part of the entire book is the description of the male tyrannasaur mounting the female and trumpeting loudly in the wild prehistoric world he inhabits!!!! 
 I am rather disappointed after buying this book. It contains just a bunch of articles about different chess topics, illustrated (mainly) with the author games. The articles are rather interesting and well written, games well annotated but ...  it is hard to find the idea behind the book as a whole.  I would rate it higher if it had title like 'Alex Yermolinsky selected chess articles'. But this book does not offer any organized plan of work towards reader chess improvement (ohh, there is suggestion to study own games on the beginning). So I am just disappointed after buying it 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 The author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the Chamber of Commerce or a right-wing think tank. Like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. In his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. He is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. He finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. His low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. Most in the West do care. Rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment.   Though the author's real target is US society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. And of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. A country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. But it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the US.   In the US, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. In actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. In this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. He contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. It is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at Wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. The actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the Wal-mart juggernaut.   He especially decries direct citizen actions. He is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. However, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. It's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of Congress to accumulate vast sums. If citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. The theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as American as apple pie. His view that such unelected bodies as the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve Board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. Who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the Fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? No, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it.   If the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. First and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. It is not surprising that Americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. The list could go on. Informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. The US most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. This is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore.   It is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. Americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. Yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. The book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.  
 Too many pieces have been performed with stringcord instruments, and I just don't feel good about the sound of classic piano. This is just my personal taste, I guess 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 As a year-round resident of a New Jersey shore community, I thought "The Big House," the history of a summer home in a Cape Cod community, would make for an interesting summer read. WRONG!  I have never read a book with such interesting potential that was so full of so many endless, boring details. The author goes to great lengths to describe in excruciating detail every brick, every shingle, every splinter, and every nail that forms the construction of the house; in addition to every cobweb in the house's endless corridors; every page in every book that resides on every shelf in every room; and every blade of grass, every tree, each individual leaf on every tree, and every weed that surrounds The Big House, to the point where you just want to scream "WILL YOU PLEASE GET ON WITH IT! DOES THE FAMILY MANAGE TO KEEP THE HOUSE, OR DOESN'T IT?"  Unlike one other reviewer who gave up on all of this endless detail after reading 75% of the book, I forced myself to finish it because, despite all the detail, I still wanted to find out whether the family managed to hang onto the property. I won't spoil the ending by revealing it here, but future readers may want to save themselves many hours of boring toil and sweat by stopping by their local library, removing the book from the shelf, reading the last few pages to learn who keeps or does not keep the house, and then returning the book to the shelf.  The dust jacket of this book proudly displays a seal that proclaims the book to be a "National Book Award Finalist," and the major benefit I received from wading through all that detail was the realization that if this author could manage to get this book published AND have it become a National Book Award Finalist, then I could do the same, and I have finally begun to write my own memoir that I have been meaning to get around to for the past 30 years. If this author can do it, so can I!  Thank you, George Howe Colt!  
 Although I admit it has been awhile since I read this book, I found this book singularly unimpressive. He makes many poorly-defended claims and makes quite a few assumptions.  Throughout the book is a very disturbing anti-intellectualism. In more than one place, he refers to the intellect as the "enemy of true Christianity." This is a wild claim that is not only unsupported by Scripture, but runs directly contrary to it. Apparantly, he has never read the passage that commands us to be "transformed by the renewing of your MIND" (Romans 12:2) or the passage where Jesus commands us to love God with all our MIND (Matthew 22:37, etc.).  One of the big problems with the book is that we don't really have all that many specific details on the exact structure of the first-century church service, either from the Bible itself or from church history. Thus this book (and many others on similar topics) must speculate quite a bit in order to fill in gaps in the authors' knowledge. That's a pretty big flaw, given that that's the point of the book.  I don't think that the author adequately proves that the "open church" model is the only - or even the best or most Biblical way - of running a church. For example, even if we grant that the structure of the 1st century church was exactly as the author describes it, what does that prove? Are the Bible's descriptions here prescriptive or descriptive? How normative is Acts for the church today? How much of the structure of the first-century church was due to necessity rather than superiority? For example, did the early church meet in houses because that's the best way for the church to operate or because the early church was forced to do so by persecution? The author fails to adequately address these issues and many more like them.  Many of the arguments the author gives for this structure are not primarily Biblical but pragmatic, and even then he fails to demonstrate that the structure is actually practical. For example, he claims (without supporting evidence) that people will be more willing to attend a church that uses this structure. In fact, evidence seems to support the contrary position; the churches that have grown the most in America are not "open churches."  I do not particularly recommend this book. It is not very well researched and his arguments are not especially compelling 
 I read the entirety of this book to learn and understand the Armenian claims. Although the language and the depictions in the book don't seem to be quiet objective as you'd expect from a true historian, I do understand why the author has such a style; After all, his studies and expenses in US are all paid by certain diaspora members and private institutes...But anyway I think as the citizens of today's modern Armenia and Turkey, we should stop focusing on the question of "is it a genocide or not?" but look at the future. I know hardliners keep saying that one should accept the history and come clean etc.. before anything else but i think such an expectation is not only needless but also another tag line of today's Entente Powers to keep both Turkey and Armenia occupied with these endless historical debates and derail these two countries future economic prosperity. I'd like to thank Mr.Akcam that he clearly points out that the indigenous Armenians and Turks of Anatolia killed each other in mass back in those years due to the fierce political ploys of European Countries; primarily France, England and Russia. They all wanted to take a piece of the Anatolia pie; home for Turks, Armenians, Kurds and all.  Back in those days, the only and ultimate method of controlling other nations and continents for one's own imperial lust was to bog them down in politics, war, massacres, finger pointing and push these weaker countries or local populations against each other as in the example of Armenians and Turks.  Yet life has changed significantly in today's technology age. A country's success is not measured by it's territorial wingspan but more with its technology capital, established structure of finance sector, adaptability to new technologies and global trends. UK,Italy, Germany and the Nordic countries have successfully made this transition within the past decades, hence they do not deal with crazy political complo theories and animosity ploys for other developing nations. However, France failed with a D in that class; they missed the technology, innovation and finance train that has been touring around the globe. They were left out with "wine and dine" leadership of the world which obviously doesn't make much money in global perspective. Hence, they keep resorting to the old political games which include pushing Armenians and Turks against each other for dog fight so that they can benefit from it. The latest evidence of this is their attempt to create a law to punish denying Armenian massacres...They knew Turks would react to this, but they knowingly pushed for it because they don't have anything better to do in today's technology century.  As a younger generation member of Turkey, I'd like to work with my Armenian brothers and sisters to bring prosperity to both nations. Regardless of what happened between us a century ago, I think this is what the two countries need; economic prosperity so that they won't be tools to other imperialist countries like France ever again in the future. The 4 million people of Armenia and 70 million people of Turkey should go hand in hand and work with each other, create more trade and partnerships.  I wish Mr.Akcam's book ended with such a note asking for more cooperation between the two countries instead of who did what? At the end of the day, no Turkish government will ever accept genocide, and no Armenian government will ever stop asking for it. So, why bother? let's just focus on the future and bring prosperity to our future generations so that they don't have to go thru bloodshed ever again 
 The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many. 
 For someone who never met Lee Strasberg, attended his classes, interviewed his students, or grasped the meaning of his work, the author has a lot to say about Strasberg.  The bulk of this book grinds its axe on a man who has  been dead since 1982.  It is wrongheaded, at times cruel, and a complete  misrepresentation of Strasberg and the Method.  It attributes a lot of our  ills to Strasberg, who produced some of the finest actors in America.  The  book actually ends up repeating much of what Strasberg advocated 
 This was a very unscriptural movie, and a very poor portrayal of King David. It was a waste of time. Professional production work and big name actors do not a good movie make. Maybe Hollywood has its own way of viewing things, but when making a movie of a written text as well known as this one, it is better to stick to what the text says. David did not scrabble on the ground for stones for his sling during the battle with Goliath, he collected them ahead of time. The affair with Bathsheba was at his idea and initiation, not hers. He did NOT have a tantrum when God told him he could not build the temple. Enough said 
 To anyone who has endured corporate life at a sub-executive level, the title of this book will be seen as a dead giveaway to the underlying motives of its authors and those to whom they pander.  The book's message? When one is too greedy a bastard to pay employees a fair wage, simply devise schemes that make them temporarily forget that they are being exploited.  Such short-term distractions allow the "chosen ones" to continue creaming off profits for themselves.  It doesn't take much time to figure out that there is a chasm between executive rewards (e.g., multi-million dollar payouts, regardless of performance) and the scattered bones thrown to an organization's "little people".  [... 
 I bought Shawnna's album and never even heard of her because I was in the mood for some female gangsta rap - Little Kim was a little too soft for me at that moment.  I listened to Shawnna's entire album and can't recall one song off the album.  Is this suppose to be a gangsta album?  How can it be gangsta when I can't even recall a word she has stated.  I can't recall many gangsta rappers who are spitting unforgettable words and still rocking the charts.  Shawnna must be pure hood and that I wouldn't like.  In addition, anyone with the stage name "Shawnna" is not going to attract any purchasers other than hood rats.  Sadly, I can't even resell it on [...] because the going rate is only $[...].  THus, I am stuck listening to "Shawnna" or letting her CD collect dust at my house.  If you are going to boast collaborations with Ludacris and Pharrell, then you need to actually come with it.  Shawnna came with nothing and will leave with nothing 
 This book was not very good.  It doesn't give enough solutions to behavior problems 
 The author has created poorly constructed and rather lifeless characters.  Although the author has imposed much passion on her characters they still seem plastic.  As for the story, well I'd rather read something else 
 I have read this book (and its companion volume) a couple of times, and to be honest I am not a fan.  Many of Jan Fennell's suggestions are useful, but none are original.   Ms Fennell's method is based on the idea of using the non-violent language of the wolf pack to put your dog in his rightful subordinate place, and therefore gain his understanding and cooperation.  Alpha wolves eat first - so Ms Fennell has the dog owner eat dinner before his dog.  Alpha wolves take the pack out hunting - so we are bid to walk our dogs daily.  Alpha wolves aren't demonstrative - so we are told to ignore our dogs for five minutes each time we arrive home from work.  These suggestions are sensible, but they are hardly revolutionary.  Maintaining dominant status by behaving like an "alpha" wolf is a technique that has been championed by many other authors - the only difference is that Ms Fennell gives this process the cutesy name of "Amichien bonding".  The technique is a good one for restoring a relationship with a dog that has been spoiled or confused in the past by weak or misinformed owners. Its success lies not only in the owner mimicking canine behaviour, but also in the institution of house rules and a predictable daily routine for the dog.    So what is wrong with this book?  The first fatal flaw is the unrealistic simplicity of the method.  Ms Fennell seems to believe that all canine behavioural problems are caused by the dog wishing to be alpha.  It is certainly true that a dog with a misplaced sense of his own importance will probably become a problem dog.  However, dogs can also behave badly for a plethora of other reasons - poor training, learned fear, boredom, health issues, confusion and inherent high prey drive, to name just a few.  Ms Fennell's insistence that all canine problems are dominance problems that can be cured by "Amichien bonding" is unfortunately just not realistic.       For a professional dog trainer, Ms Fennel also displays a rather disturbing lack of knowledge about several dog breeds.  At one point she states that it may be impossible to fully train Bull Terriers "and dogs of this type" due to their inherent "savage natures"!  One gets the impression that she has been unable to train this type of dog herself and holds a grudge about it.  Whatever the reason, I find it somewhat disingenuous of her to ignore the fact that other trainers have managed to train these breeds to very high standards, and blame her own failure to do so on the dogs instead of on her own methods.  In short?  If you know very little about dog behaviour and have a mildly pushy dog, then this book isn't a bad buy.  Certainly, applying the "Amichien bonding" advice won't hurt.  It is the same type of programme as recommended by dog behaviourists the world over (you can get much of the same information for free on the internet, from Shirley Chong's website for example).    However, Ms Fennell's book is not a comprehensive guide to solving every dog's problems.  If your dog has moderate to serious behavioural problems, save your money and book a consultation with a professional behaviourist.  Your dog will thank you for it.   
 Uptight guy versus bringer of joy and light. Fun food against staid religion. Haven't I seen this before? Oh yes, it was a Disney Film. I like the recipes, but the story is so hackneyed it had to be made into a movie. Death is even personified in this book; what an original idea! I read to the end because I love chocolate, but otherwise, this tedious heap of cliche is exactly what's wrong with "literature" today and doesn't merit recommendation 
 The quality of the art covered in this book is highly uneven and many of the theories are terribly dated by today's standards. I get the impression that it was written more to promote the friends of the authors than to give an objective view of Feminist art. The Phaidon Press book from the Themes and Movements series, Art and Feminism, is MUCH better to the point that I am almost embarrassed to compare the two books.  There is a school of Feminist research that seems to equate technical accomplishment with patriarchy which conveniently allows mediocre art to seem quite important. Overall, the art in this book lacks guts, although some of it is good. Since it is no longer the only book of its type, get it only if you want to round off your collection. Otherwise, stick with the Phaidon Press book to which this one merely pales in comparrison 
 This was not very good, in my opinion. The Ring scared the bejeezus outta me. This was not scary. Two weeks afterwards, I still find my mind wandering about one thing...why the heck didn't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room? If I walk into my house and see a half-naked boy meowing and hissing at me, I'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin 
   The south is blowing up quickly but the reason is because the real niggaz just took a break (Westside, and Eastcoast) but when they come back there will be a war to claim who is king.    T.I. will be one of many Dirty South rappers who will battle to the end as a soldier to defend to title and I will be proud say he is the best. (Trap Muzik) proves it, how ever this album is a disapointment coming from someone who took the time to buy, and listen to it. Please run to the store and get Trap Muzik, and I'm Serious I recommented it to every Dirty South fan 
 I guess I was expecting more of a Ferrante and Teicher thing with more than one piano going at a time ... could be that it is but, if so, am missing depth ... great family but disappointing albu 
 Here's my sincere take on Savage: I think it's mostly an act. Savage understands Biology as a discipline and decided to carve out a niche for himself as the most vitriolic and angry of political commentators. There's just no way a guy could be that angry without having a blood pressure problem so extreme that the pressure he thinks he's under would violate Boyle's Law.  Having said that, how does singling out a section of the population genuinely advance the political debate in this country?  If a person wants to marginalize the political extremes the USA should then go to a parliamentary system of govt., which seems to be what the founding fathers envisioned anyway, before Alexander Hamilton got involved.  For those who doubt my veracity, please read the Articles of Confederation and articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution. Our Constitution's major flaw, IMO, is making the prez commander-in-chief, which has allowed our past and current presidents to use the military as their own private police force. Just look at that ginned-up Iraq war were stuck in now. I will say as a former Republican that I'm aghast at the Orwellian nature of the current administration, which seems to be hostile to civil liberties taken for granted in the English speaking world for 900 years. I certainly hope the Supreme Court doesn't uphold a law which makes possible the suspension of Habeas Corpus, especially at the discretion of this president.  We may never get this right back. We didn't seem to need these laws when we fought terrorists in the past.   I'm aware that the book's title is taken from a quote by a Roman senator. But Savage doesn't have a monopoly on Roman quotes. Here's 1 from the Roman historian Tacitus worth considering:   "You have made a desert, and call it Peace." 
 Lynn sets all her stories in Australia which is refreshing. But her stories are short and just like her book 'Gold Fever' the story needed more! More scenes between the characters, more love scenes, more interaction. "Fliss comes out and everybody is happy" - I wish! I don't understand why her books are so short. Is the publisher forcing her to push them out quickly?  Most authors grow and expand in their writing I didn't feel this was the case here. I doubt I will buy anymore of her books.   
 I can't really smell, but everyone who has been around me as said it smelled terrible. Smells like ammonia is the answer i usually got. i then tried putting it on, then putting on some of my good colonge and it didnt help any. Only one girl thought it smelled nice... she thought it smelled like vanilla. All others... list of about 20+ said it smelled bad. I am going to return it for my money back. You can give it a try... 1/20 are the odds i got, not good enough for me to spend $40 on 
 The description of this book should have said something about what size rice cooker all the recipes are for.  Once I started reading the book, I discovered all the recipes are made for an 8-10 cup cooker.  I would not have purchased the book if I had known this.  I bought a 3-cup cooker when I bought this book, and I can't figure out how to scale down the recipes to fit in my cooker.  So, the book is basically useless to me.  
 I have to second the other reviewer's comments about the Partially Hydrogenated oil that Kellog's is using in KID cereal!?!?  It is the year 2006, time to start making these cereals HEALTHY and withOUT trans-fat ridden CHEAP oils!!!!  
 This was the first novel I've read by Sydney Sheldon.  The character development, plot development and prose is drivel compared to books by Greg Iles, Joseph Finder, Nelson DeMille, Richard Crais, Michael Connelly, Sheldon Siegel, and Richard North Patterson.  Its so bad, I'm throwing the book out so I won't make the mistake of rereading it.  Raise your standards people!  
 Very disappointed in this book. I found it a shallow and pretentiously technical book 
 I don't believe it.  I'm sorry.  Any perceived reduction in pain can be caused by the placebo affect.  I highly doubt that someone who had bowed legs, all of a sudden had straight legs in five minutes.  The author is vague and the chapters lack documentation (Once, there was this lady who came to me...).  The author claims to be able to change the molecular structure of water by "running energy" into it.  Sorry, I might be closed minded, but there is no way.  The whole "quantum physics" thing is just a scientific explanation that, conveniently, no one can disprove, and the author uses this to his advantage to sell books, dvds, training sessions, etc.. 
 I cannot understand how this video can be rated higher than one star.  It has almost no information at all.  It is so basic, that it cannot even be considered as instructional.  And the editing?  Horrible!  If you like watching a DVD where the people's heads are cut off continually throughout the DVD, you will enjoy this.  I have found more useful short videos available to view from internet sites and they contain way more information.  The price is ridiculous for what is contained in this video.  It should be more like $4.99.  I am so sorry that I spent the money on this DVD.  Do not consider it an instructional DVD...especially if you already know what a kayak or a paddle look like.  I'm not kidding.  After watching it, you'll ask yourself, "That's it?!"  I threw out this DVD after watching it once 
   WOW!  It is still incredible to see what sort of fairy tales people still believe even after all the evidence that these people refuse to open their eyes to because it doesn't fit their "religion" of evolution.  Everybody knows that evolution is a fact, but Evolution is such a silly idea it's hard to believe there is anybody left on Earth that has even a grade school education that still worships at the feet of that idiot Darwin.  WOW 
 Brick's biggest hit, "Dazz" is spectacular in its long version, with its whistling/flute combo which I've never heard before or since in any musical genre.  You'd think it would naturally be included on the greatest hits album, since they are essentially a one hit wonder.  No such luck, as this compilation contains the short radio version of the song.  "Dusic" is the only other song which is halfway decent, but hardly warrants shelling out $10.  What a disappointment.. 
 This book fascinates me because it was challenged by the NAACP in 1945 for its quiet exclusionary racism 
 Okay I don't even own this or heard enough of this but from what I heard this recording is quite poor. Otep are basically a death metal band with a female vocalist. But are they the first to do it? Nope! Another death metal band with a female vocalist is Arch Enemy but unlike this band, Arch Enemy are awesome. While Arch Enemy are basically like In Flames or Dark Tranquillity with a female vocalist, Otep are more like a nu-metal band with a female vocalist. However this vocalist is cr a p! She sounds like she's screaming and then suddenly moaning. The guitars are complete garbage as well, just the same old 3 chords with no solos. I'd give this 2 stars to be forgiving but if you want a real chick metal band then listen to Arch Enemy or Nightwish instead of this mediocre group 
 I have great respect for Charles Jencks as an architect, and as a critic of art relating to such. Therefore the book should be retitled, What is Postmodern Architecture? Or what is everything about Post-Modernism except  the art? The main focus seems to be on the industrial world which created  the art, rather then the art. Seems hardly revolutionary or even relevant  since everyone and their brother and sister has written on that subject  since 1820. I was hoping for something which would address the art, but I  was sorely disappointed. The constant focus on the world around the  buildings of postmodernism dragged and was inebriatingly dull (It got to  the point where the author was forced to contradict himself to make the  book interesting). The focus of Postmoderism was once architecture,  however, now the focus has shifted, it seems everyone except the academics  know this. Not only was his sections on art and literature stupid, but  incorrect, and blunderingly light. I expected more from Jencks, being the  great mind of the century he was. If you want to know anything helpful and  relevant pretaining to Post Modernism today, do not read this book. But hey  if you want to know about your father's post modernism, read this book 
 I used to love all the different books written by this author, whether she was writing as Amanda Quick, Jayne Anne Krentz or Jayne Castle.  Now they are all so dull - almost over-detailed.  This book is no different.  While the premis of "para-psychology" could have been interesting the language developed by the author to describe the different types of psychics is confusing and over-used.  I found myself skipping huge chunks of this book just to get to the point of the conversation.  Don't waste your money -borrow it if you are a die hard fan or wait for it at the local library.  I only gave it one star because her heros are usually the strong, silent type - a personal favorite of mine 
 I am very disturbed that the author is even allowed to publish his ideas concerning depression. I am a 57 year old man, who just recently after 9 years of "chemical" inbalance deep depression, evolved into  complete freedom  from depression.  It was the right "chemical"  medicine, from a great doctor, which saved my mental life. I would still be  in a state of horrible depression, if i was waiting for Prayer as a cure.   The author needs to realize that there are two kinds of depression:(1)  "chemical" inbalance,(2)mild, or no "chemical"  inbalance. The first one is finally treated only by correct  "chemical" medication, which brings you out of the depression  itself.  It is organic in nature, like an infection of the body, which can  be healed by a wonder drug.  You take aspirin to help stop pain by a  "chemical" action in your body; you could pray all day and a  tooth ache will not stop hurting.  Likewise, "chemical" inbalance  depression of the brain will be erased only by "chemical" means:  proper medicine given by a doctor who deals with "chemical"  inbalance disease.  Mild depression, on the other hand, is treated by  talking out your problem. A certain idea in your head is bothering you;  after talking about it( whether death of a friend, husband, or loss of a  job), a person over a period of time comes out of depression.  It is not  "chemical" in nature.  It may be emotional,etc.; however, it can  be resolved by talking it "out" loud, so to speak, with any  person who will just listen very carefully to you.  After a period of time,  the person in "mild" depression will get over it, or will no  longer be in depression.  The idea that  a "christian" life  style, as suggested by the author, can treat severe, "chemical"  inbalance depression-- is just plain foolishness.  It is very dangerous;  and, i am sure that most people will take it with a "grain" of  salt--so to speak.  The author should concern himself with religion, and  get out of the "mental" health field.  He presents solutions  which are bible based; the correct solutions, which most educated people  would likely agree with, are mind based 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I was very disappointed with the DVD version.  In the middle of the movie, you will have to get up, go to your DVD player, and flip the DVD over to the second side to see the rest of the movie.  I don't know what bozo came up with that idea, but it defeats the purpose of relaxing and enjoying a good movie.  Who wants to get up and flip the DVD over in the middle of the suspense?  This format takes stupidity to the next level.  I would highly recommend the VHS since I have it and it's wonderful.  I would NOT recommend the DVD until they do a better version.  The packaging is in paper and not durable at all, another truly bad idea.  DVD's should be in plastic cases, not paper 
 The book was just too short, without enough information.  If you cut out the part on hunting, the biography (both are parts I"m not really interested in as a 3-D target shooter), their wasn't a great deal left.  Good information on tuning and the author's technique I guess, but he could have added a lot more to clarify.  It's like the book didn't have an editor 
 When I first saw this movie, I thought it was pretty stupid. I'm sure you all have your oppinions, but really, can you believe the CGI? The animation in this show leaves a lot to be desired. The creatures don't even blend in with their environment, and they all look smooth as clay. No texures evident at all! And the theories? Oh boy, how do I explain this, other than saying it was complete RUBBISH!!! Let me just state a few theories that had me rolling with laughter! First, there is the thought that tortises would evolve into creatures that grew to be larger than the largest dinosaur! Second, you have flying fish that look like and sound like fish, and can actually......well.....FLY!!! Finally, this thought almost made me die of laughter; squids will emerge from the water and INHERIT the Earth!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!?????!!!!!??! This is not science people! True science is something you can study first-hand, and examine in a lab for goodness sake!!! Evolution itself is still a theory in question, and suddenly, scientists believe that they can predict evolution's every move? Even in the distant future!?! Then again, I don't see why they can't, because this "theory" was made up by man in the first place!!! Finally, the names of these "future" creatures were so stupid with a capital "S", that I nearly urinated in my jeans when I heard names like, Flish, Snowstalker, Sharkopath, and Toraton! But look at the bright side, this could be a new idea for, yet another, expansion pack to the Pokemon series. Overall.......Oh whatever you know my opinion: If you are gullible and closed minded toward this pseudo-science, then be my guest. Put your brain in a blender, bring a bucket of popcorn with you, and have a blast! On the other hand, if you are more open minded toward genuine facts, then please....do yourself a favor, and watch more realistic, less evolution based programs, such as the "Walking With..."series, and it's spin-offs.    
 I'm surprised no other reviewer noticed! Why did Penquin place Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. prominently on the cover? In this reviewer's opinion, they must secretly realize that the wonderful 1937 classic film vastly outshines the printed word. I found the  story to be poorly written and hard to follow. Its' style is too formal, too flowery and too wordy!	If I had not seen (both) versions of the film, I could not have followed the "action". I constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself. A review of "PZ" boils down to a basic truth: While most agree that the book is usually superior, occasionally the movie wins out. "PZ" is a prime example. ("Strangers on a Train" is another!). As for the so -called sequel, "Rupert of Hentzau"- don't even bother, unless you are an Anthony Hope fanatic. Reviewing the book makes one appreciate-once again- that wonderful film fadeout as Ronald Colman rides off over the hill. Since it happens to be available on amazon, click on the movie reviews. Therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of "The Prisoner of Zenda" 
 This book could have been written by the "the N.I.C.E" from C.S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength.  This is quite simply the most cynical book I've ever read. There are no positive messages or characters. The Heart of Darkness, an exploration of evil in us all, is cheerful in comparison.  The setting is a religious (Catholic) school called Trinity. The teachers and administrators are called brothers (Jesuits?). The brothers are all either completely corrupt, complicit or psychologically weak. The main character who fights for his own road, in the end, recants. His friend, the only other marginally moral character is portrayed as both weak and unwilling to go against the group, no matter what the cost. The other characters are either portrayed as amoral (Archie) or unwilling to stand up to the promptings of their conscious.   I guess this last point is the most disturbing yo me. There are many characters who are prompted by their conscience to act against some kind of wrong, they all ultimately FAIL TO ACT ON IT.  The main message: Life is pointless and filled with selfish and hateful people. Trying to fight against this (no matter what your conscience tells you) is futile. Those who are the most self-serving and manipulative triumph in the end.  I found this book fully out of touch with reality. I have been down some dark roads in my life and in 42 years have yet to meet anyone as selfish and malevolent as Archie or Brother Leon. The sheer numbers of bad and weak-willed in one school is just absurd.     
 This item was suggested to me by my local birth center. I should have noticed the word "wrap", but I didn't give it too much thought. There are two main problems with this baby carrier: 1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion. 2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top. I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them. On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of. 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 If the names of the characters are mythological derivatives and other similarities abound, you will not be surprised or shocked to spot the bad guys very early. Have I got a swan for you 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 The concept for the book is good--perform a historical survey that pulls together the history of the British navy and its influence on England/UKs role and presence in the world.  Mr. Herman has a very readable style.  That said, there are three critical flaws that every reader should be aware of in this book: 1) There are numerous historical errors and incorrect facts sprinkled through this book.   2) Mr. Herman appears to shape, twist and manipulate the historical record to fit his interpretations of events.  It isn't so much that he stretches his interpretation to match events, as that he manipulates results of events and glosses over important aspects of them so that they don't interfere with his view. 3) The most dangerous of these flaws, especially coupled with the above two issues, is that Mr. Herman uses this book as a platform to advance his particular views on politics and economics.  If you want to argue against international arms control treaties, write a book or essay or article about don't. Don't place a random, unsupported sentence in a book that purports to be a history of the British Navy.  Overall, this book introduced me to a number of areas of the history of the British Navy that I had not been well acquainted with, but whatever I learned, I now have to call in question because of Herman's poor attention to historical accuracy, willingness to twist the historical record and desire to use this book as a piece of propoganda.  If you are interested in naval history, this is NOT a good starting point.  This is an interesting book if you have a sufficient background to recognize where Mr. Herman makes his mistakes and takes his liberties 
 This system will not work.  Let's assume your playing in a 6-deck game. This system has you start your running count at -20, with -4 or higher as the "key" (The point at which you bet high). Using the KO method, after all of the decks are counted through the count will be +4. Does anyone else see the flaw here? Let's say you have a count of -3. This system tells you to bet high (Even suggesting 10 betting units!). But think about it, if a deck completely counted through will end up at +4, then there's a better chance that you'll be drawing low cards, meaning the dealer actually has the advantage. Put simply, if you use this system YOU WILL BE BETTING HIGH WHEN THE DEALER HAS THE ADVANTAGE. If I'm wrong then correct me, please. But I believe this is a very faulty system. If you win anything using it, count it off as luck. Eventually it will ruin you.  This book explains other counting systems as being near impossible for the average person to learn; even explaining how difficult the Hi-Lo system is (Bull). The Hi-Lo system is still the easiest effective counting system (Explained well in Wong's "Professional Blackjack") with the Omega II being one of the most powerful (Beautifully explained in "Blackjack for Blood" by Bryce Carlson). I highly recommend either one of those two systems.  There is a note in this book about the notion of blackjack books being put out by casinos to sort of sabotage counters with false tips. I believe this may very possibly be one of those books. Avoid, avoid, avoid 
 I read this book because: of my love for old school jazz and the big "HOOPLA" over this publication! I can't say that I gained much knowledge from this book. If you are a true collector of jazz and know Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Lee Morgan, Charlie Parker, Dizzy, Wes Montgomery, Freddie Hubbard, Billie Holiday, Coltrane and others then you already know more or as much as what is written here.You've got 512 pages to tell a story about a subject so diverse and complex that I don't know how he did it and felt that justice was done! What I would have preferred he did was to write several books on jazz EACH concentrating on a particular era. That way I think the public would get a true and comprehensive study of our most beautiful and natural resource--jazz. Sorry but I can't offer a rating higher than 2 - 2 1/2 stars 
 Jasper Becker belongs in the camp that wants to attack North Korea and force regime change. As such, this book tries to justify a war by hyping up all the bad things happening in North Korea. He is also trying to sell his book by sensationalizing North Korea like a cheap tabloid. He thinks that America can save the North Koreans by destroying their country. This book is almost a neocon propaganda - very biased, and one-sided.  
 There are some writers whose books are so, well, just plain bad, awful, terrible, dreadful, etc., etc., that they're a waste of perfectly good paper.    This is so bad--  It deserves to be blamed for global warming.    
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 This book included ideas such as everyone taking their baths in a wading pool outside to save on water and electricity! It also had many ideas on how to spend a lot of money on vitamins and bread mixers and wheat  grinders. Great if you really like to do those things though not exactly  some- thing that would simplify life for a busy mom 
 This is likely the single worst statistics book that I have ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on. This is definitely on of those "look how smart I am" books and lacks any real practical use. It's full of contradictions, vague information, and generally stinks to high heavan 
 My wife dropped the original remote and it quite working.  It turns out there are PCB's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so I resoldered it and it worked for a little while, probably until the next time she dropped it.  I bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also.  Could not find the problem this time.  It still transmitted, but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on.  I unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and I could not start the truck.  I messed with it (while in the parking lot of an amusment park) for a long time and evetually got it to stop, probably by entering valet mode, I'm not sure.  Don't waste your money on another $100 remote.  I am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the LCD.  Should be more reliable.  My suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes: One LCD and one simple.  Better yet, buy a system that does not have the feedback, or 2 way, and save a lot of money and headache.  You won't use it anyway 
 The book is too disjointed and much of it reads like poetry this isn't what I expected 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 This monitor has so much static! We would always have to move it all over our bedroom just to find a good spot. Sometimes you can hear other babies crying! When it comes through our monitor we can't tell if it is our baby or not! And then to top it off, the cord broke so we ended up having to tape it to the monitor to keep it plugged in. Otherwise it would unplug by itself and we would wake up in the morning to find that it was off! The only good thing about this product are the lights but you can find that on other ones. Don't waste your money.... keep looking 
 I really want to like this book.  The explainations are good. The projects are nice and game oriented so they keep your attention.  However, the book has a large number of mistakes in the text.  Especially in the code you need to follow.  Also, the author totally misses on showing off Object Oriented Programing.  He gives a decent showing of what OOP is, but the project that comes in that chapter lacks the creation of any Classes.  I was really liking the explaination of OOP, but you get nearly no experience of it from the project.  This book had a lot of potential, but misses 
 After using this product for about a month and a half, I began to get very high blood pressure readings (157/106).  My doctor took my BP on the same day and got 130/80, which I also got with my manual cuff.  I find that this machine tends to show a rapid pulse as well.  The only good thing about it is that you don't have to record your readings manually.  If they calibrate the machine properly, it would be a great thing, but I wasted my money 
 When this book arrived after ordering it from Amazon (and being fooled by other reviews), my husband and I couldn't stop laughing--this is not an encyclopedia but a pocket sized dictionary (literally 2inches squared), with entries such as "ants"--the descriptions of anything are way too short to be of any merit, and if you really need to look up the definition of "ant" you are going to need a lot more help in your garden than this book can supply!!  The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is the shock-value I had when I received it--and a good laugh is always worth something.  In place you might consider Nancy Bubel's "Seed Starting Handbook"--lots of useful, easy-to-follow, and fairly detailed information on gardening 
 I was shocked to hear he is related to an african music/jazz music legend. I would have expected something better than this. Mr Lonely is a cute unserious song with an awesome piano hook but the rest is bland cra 
 As the parent of a child who was a voracious reader; (we read tons of books together when she was small) I really was not at all impressed with this book. I purchased this book for my friend's little boy, based on the reviews here and was so disappointed. Granted some time had passed since I bought children's books, but I have started buying them again for my grandaughter. I returned it because I felt too embarassed to give this book. The only cute feature about this book is the eye catching illustrations that would appeal to toddlers. Story or content wise, it's about as much fun to read as watching paint dry. 
 To much guitar, drowns out all the other instruments.  Survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums, not guitars.  I was expecting another Burning Heart, Is this Love, High on you.  No songs on this albums have that sound.  The vocals by Jamison are top notch, but none of the songs sound like the Survivor I remember.  Survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards, bass and drums, not drive the whole song. I guess Jim Peterik was the man behind Survivor all along.  I give the CD 2 stars for Fire makes Steel, the rest are throw aways.  ***Recommended for die hards only*** I highly recommend 'When Seconds Count' for anyone getting started with Survivor 
 I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.  I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone 
 At least at first, the tone is like trying to sell you the book you already brought. Quite repetitive too. Then a lot of pure blank "write-your-notes-here" pages and too many "readers say" pages making you feel "enough already". It says it has 288 pages, but it actually has 274 and pages 251 to 274 are just commercials (ie. "valuable coupons"). What's most irritating is the usage of the psychology of the numbers. 50% here, 10% there, scattered around every page in the book making you feel informed. The author knows that numbers give credibility and abuses this technique to the point that insults the reader's intelligence. Maybe it's that I'm not used to management books...  On the positive side, the book *does* have good tips (although nothing I didn't thought of myself) on buying materials, and quite a lot of tips on dealing with subs, generals, etc. I especially liked the parts dealing with the stress and anxiety associated with such kind of projects, and how it might affect your marriage, something you don't take too seriously at first. Another nice phrase: "We were surprised at our limitations when we began to do self work." - some owner-builders are too optimistic about what they think they can do themselves.  All in all, the book can prove useful, if you can get past the commercial aggressivity with which it's written. 
 This book has a lot of funiture plans in it but the plans are too small with some descriptions/lengths/etc being so small you needed a magnifying glass to read them.  Too many details crammed into one drawing.  No color pictures.  I wasn't impressed 
 I usually enjoy James Pattersons' Alex Cross stories. I am not a die-hard fan, but I have always found myself entertained when reading most of the previous novels. But London Bridges hit rock bottom almost from the very beginning.  The story is made from the same formula the past 3-4 Cross-stories has been, and you can almost guess what will happen in the super-short chapters.  First we are inside the mind of one or more of the villains while they commit some gruesome crime, and the plotline is laid out. Then Dr Cross enters the stage, usually semi-depressed over something in his private life, a condition not made any better by the crime he is called in to solve, again usually with a bunch of colleagues, who can be detectives or federal agents, depending on where you are in the series. This time he is upset because of his youngest son, who lives with his mother in Seattle, a long way from Washington DC, where Cross resides with his older kids and his grandmother. Cross is also upset because he has to break up a date with his girlfriend Jamilla, a detective living in San Francisco, in order to get to the scene of this novels 'basic' crime.  This time the villain The Wolf has blown a trailerpark community off the face of the earth, and threatens to do the same to some of the world's major cities, if he is not paid a gazillion dollars and if some political prisoners are not set free. A deadline is given, the clock is ticking and Cross travels from America to Europe and back again and then to Europe and then to USA again within a week or so, in order to catch The Wolf and his fellow thugs, each of the thugs acting out their piece of The Wolf's big puzzle and way to world dominion.  The last 10 pages are utterly confusing, there is no tail nor head, the story seems to be all over the place, and at last you really could not care less if Cross and his whole family will actually survive the ordeals.  This book is not recommend for anyone excpet die hard Patterson/Cross fans. It does not live up to the expectations, but if Patterson can write 5-6 novels a year, then maybe there is an explanation for this book's lacking in quality 
 For the most part, this is a delightful book. As I read this book, I felt as though I were curling up at the feet of a masterful boyfriend, listening to his words of wisdom. (I don't know why that uppity chit found his calls offensive.) Unfortunately, I am very, very afraid that I have to differ with Bill on one point: Jeb Bush. So what if social services have crumbled during his tenure as governor of Florida? Tens of thousands of brown children are being sacrificed in our glorious adventure in Iraq. Why worry about Florida? Jeb Bush is a loyal soldier devoted to the cause. He handily delivered the state to his brother, our leader. I would think that gives him carte blanche, n'est ce pas? (I am just checking to make sure that you are not French, Bill.)One star only. Get with the program 
 I though that the book, The End of Physics was too much like a skeptical newspaper article, and not enough scientific interest.  The book was hardly informative, and much too pesimistic.  I can't even give the book away 
 I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.    The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.     The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)  Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.    This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue 
 THE Beat Poet fails to deliver once again. i seriously don't know where this man's fame comes from. it isn't his poetry (with the exception of Howl and a few other poems). there really isn't much to say about ginsberg's work other than it is bad. maybe if he had spent a little time in revision he could have done better. you're best off with his selected or collected poems 
 Shahak was a chemistry professor better known for his racist, anti-Jewish diatribes. His allegations range from the outright distorted to the flat out fictional. One example is the often used slander that the Talmud allows relations with minors. Actually, it is a sin and a crime under Jewish law. It is rape. There IS a discussion that does NOT ask whether it is allowed but whether the victim of this rape is considered a "non-virgin" when they grow up and seek to marry. In a culture where virginity is considered important for marriage, the victim may become a double victim, victimized by the rapist and again by society, being labelled a "non-virgin." The final answer is that they are considered a virgin when it comes time to get married. However, this discussion that "it is as nothing" is taken out of context as if it allowed rape. Shahak also makes many bizarre and patently false allegations such as his claim that Jews and Israelis dont' use "+" signs in addition because they are "little crosses" and that observant Jewish ritual involves desecrating Christian graves. If many readers who don't know much about Judaism find it an "eye opener," there is good reason. Shahak is making this stuff up.   If you want to know what Judaism REALLY says or Jewish Law, the Talmud really says, find out for yourself. Go to your local orthodox synagogue and ask for lessons or go to a free class. Heck, pretend you're Jewish and see what we "really" think and say. And you can also check out: http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Cyprus/8815/ http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/ 
 This should be titled pre-beginner.  The morning exercise hardly even gives you a stretch.  It really is just a waste of time.  The afternoon exercise is a little more of a stretch, but neither is close to being a good solid yoga stretch/workout.  I am just a beginner, but this is totally a waste of time and very limited energy.  
 I have worked in the 'Osteoarchaeology' field for nearly 10 years and I when I bought this book I did not expect to be reading a novel type book. Books like this are dramatised on frequently watched cable/network tv - I live in Ireland! I have used other books by the author and found them invaluable, but not this.....an ok read but dreadful reference material 
 This is a very comprehensive book about the general subject of raising bilingual children, based on a number of case studies. I am sure that therefore it would be of great use to anyone studying a linguistic subject in this realm.   However as a handbook for parents who want to raise a bilingual child it hardly offers any advise. I have a different native tongue than my wife, who's native language is English. Living in an English speaking country I would like my daughter to learn my (foreign) native language too. What I was looking for is a book with tips and ideas, such as word games, books, etc. to bring a second language playfully and naturally into a toddler's life.   If you are looking for such a book too, this is not the one. Although the book may be good for a linguistics student I have to give it a low rating because of its misleading title 
 OK, I'm a SciFi fan.  I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end.  Just one problem, they forgot to write the end.  What happened?  Did they run out of money?  Did the writer write himself into a corner?  There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution.  You can argue till you are blue in the face about "pan & scan."  I prefer movies with an ending.  If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you 
 Contentwise, I won't toss darts OR roses. This is genre stuff. You either like it or you don't. My beef is with the technical quality. It is execrable. (1) It is NOT in widescreen (Cinemascope), which it ought to be for a biblical spectacular. There is simply no excuse for cranking out a full-screen treatment in a DVD issued in the year 2000. (2) The so-called "digital remastering" must be kitchen-table grade, because the shapes are fuzzy, colors oversaturated, visuals mushy. This DVD should be withdrawn from the market and a new widescreen version substituted. I get better quality from my VHS of this movie than the DVD I purchased. Lousy lousy lousy, as I said. 
 I was dissapointed with this novel. It seemed to me that the book kept dragging itself. While there were interesting turns at some places, the conclusion was not dramatic. It did not make sense why one of those characters would have done the crime -- it was almost like the novel had to be ended and a culprit had to be picked by the toss of a coin.   While the details into Victorian society are good -- the author repeats the same sentences too many times in the book. It could definitely have been a shorter book with a poor end 
 I recently found this first book of Durant's impressive-looking multivolume history set at my local library and was instantly enraptured at the thought of a comprehensive tour down through the ages of our known history. Unfortunately my expectations were soon dashed as I began to read. Instead of history, I found one man's opinions and a lot of rank speculation. While admittedly much of history is guesswork because, well, we weren't there, this author stretches that license beyond what is reasonable.  "History" as that term is normally defined means a narrative of what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and to whom it happened. In several hundred pages I learned very little to answer these fundamental questions. What I found instead were rather strained conclusions and sometimes quite enormous logical leaps about cultural characteristics and mores of ancient peoples, often based on the scantiest of evidence. For example, the discovery of cereal grains in a non-native environment is interpreted to mean that a people "must" have already developed agriculture. What about the possibility of trade? What about the possibility that, at that time, the cereals in question were, in fact, native to that area? Large numbers of these types of sweeping conclusions, in my opinion, left me with little confidence in the credibility of what I was reading. Another example is the author's unabashedly Darwinistic bent that leads him to place far too much weight on the reliability of the "Peking Man" and similar fossil evidence. Even he uses words like "may" and "possibly" in describing whether these are, in fact, human remains. However, the extreme sketchiness of this and other evidence doesn't deter him from making rather dogmatic statements about presumed developments during the paleolithic period.  Similar to that were the author's repeated interjections of his own opinions about the development of culture, morality, social norms, etc. Again, as a student of history I want to know what happened, not the author's opinion about what happened. Yet when I read statements about how clothing developed as the result of a regressive cultural movement away from the "paradise of primitive nudity," quite frankly I just want to yak up my lunch. The author also seems to seize frequent opportunities to take jabs at the opinions and conclusions of other researchers. It was almost as if I were sitting in on one side of a petty squabble between a couple of petulant children.  In short, the flavor I got of Will Durant's master work in the first several hundred pages left me deeply disappointed. I was very much looking forward to reading the whole set, but now I cannot see the point of wasting any more time on even the first volume. Just because it's big and old, that doesn't mean it's great 
 I'm a student at Williams College and I previewed what the book said about my school, through the "Look inside the book feature." This book says Williams has 1,200 undergrads which is completely wrong. We have about 2,100 undergrads. Being 75% off about a school's size is not good. I dont know if there are other factual errors but based on the Williams entry, I would assume so 
 I really did love his collaboration with Deepak on Living Beyond Miracles, but I am beginning to grow tired of hearing the same stuff. If you want original and someone who is a gifted writer and humble man, Deepak is so much more of a deep thinker. I get really tired of hearing Wayne regurgitate other people's work. It is as if he doesn't have an original thought without quoting someone else's work.  And when he told the audience thank you for him being able to buy a house on Maui, I was actually a little bit offended in that I felt sorry for the audience. (I saw this on PBS) At first, they laughed and then they actually looked sad after he said it. I have heard him do this in every single audio work I have listened to in some way or another, and it is truly full of the ego he tells us to get away from.  I know we're all human, but there always seems to be a sting in his work that shows how big his head really is. Too bad! Without it, he could change so many more people's lives 
 Total agreement with the first 4 reviewers.  Van Welleghem should not be writing, and if he has an editor, the editor should find another occupation.  Eddy Mercxx was an idol of mine as a teenager, and still inspires my riding and racing today, several decades later.  Unfortunately, this book is very poorly written--utterly repetitious, without inspiration or insight--it's making a fascinating subject a chore to explore 
 I have seen some junk over the years, but this takes the prize...the most useful part was the 3.5mm cord and batteries. I doubt that this product cost more than $5 to make and I think its an embarrassment to Monster Cable, who I thought associated themselves with 'quality'...avoid this like the plague and go and buy the Tivoli-PAL...sure its more expensive, but you'll regret buying this Monster product, unless of course you make telephone calls with two bean tins and a piece of string, in which case you'll be pleasantly suprised 
 I bought this book from Amazon in good faith that it was specifically about Burmese cats.  It is not!  It is a book about cats in general, with the only Burmese-specific selling point being all its pretty pictures.  And while the pictures are quite nice, I found they alone were not sufficient in replacing actual knowledge about Burmese cats.  I wanted to learn about this particular breed, not just read very general cat facts that can easily be found in any sort of cat book.  If you're going to buy this book -- don't!  You can find alot more good information about Burmese cats (for free) by conducting internet searches 
 There are many significant shortcomings in this interactive DVD game.  I do not recommend it at all. It is not at all like the real Feud. The most frustrating shortcoming is that you must get the answers in the right order, since it reveals them in order, or you lose.  No steals, no strikes.  Sadly, I can't return it since its a DVD game 
 I thought the book was a bunch of bolagna. I didnt care for it at all and someone should burn it. The only reason i liked it was because it had a bunch of short stories and not just one big book with a bunch of chapters. It had a lot of truth in it which is the only good part of the book. The book was basically about kids that dont fit in and are outsiders. Who ever get's this bpok should throw it away or tearit and burn it into peices 
 I thought this would be a great way to train my puppy to ring the chime when she had to go out. I was so excited to get it... and the chime didn't work. Oh Well 
 My wife and I are long-time photographers (digital and film) who are planning on adding wedding photography to our resumes.  We found this book to be useless.       Consider the title: Professional Techniques for Digital Wedding Photography.  First, there is very little content in this book that would qualify as a "professional technique."  In fact, only a handful of pages are dedicated to any sort of photographic technique.  Second, much of the book is wasted trying to convince the reader that it's time to invest in digital photography.  Well, if you've purchased a book for "...Digital Wedding Photography", there's a pretty good chance that you've already made (or are about to make) the leap into the digital medium.   As for content, I am not sure to whom the authors are targeting this book.  The initial chapters are spent trying to convince the professional photographer that his/her days are numbered if he/she is still shooting film.  The remainder of the book appears to be targeting aspiring wedding photographers by providing a marginally useful discussion of the business end of wedding photography (something a professional is already familiar with) along with a very shallow treatment of Photoshop techniques.  Finally, the photos are, by and large, less than inspirational.  If you are a newbie hoping to start your own wedding photography business, this book may provide a few useful tidbits but won't do much to get you there.  More likely, you will be annoyed by the condescending digital-or-nothing tone prevalent throughout this book.  If you are a professional photographer, then you are probably already familiar with the pros & cons of switching to digital photography.  If not, I suggest putting the $30 toward a new lens and try a free book instead: the Yellow Pages.  Find a nearby professional camera shop.  You'll get more information regarding the costs and advantages of going digital than you will from this book. 
 Hey all ! I highly do not recommend this movie. First I can not understand how this movie shattered the box office? Is this really the best that a Korean film can offer?I already know that no is the answer. The movie was so boring i found myself fast forwarding through the so called action scenes. Anytime there is action the director chose to use the violent shaking of the camera technique. All that does is make you feel dizzy and confused. This movie introduces nothing new and is not unique in any way . At least in this movie its still possible to dodge automatic weapon fire from 20 M-16s , avoid being blown up by diving towards the camera in slow motion, and stop bombs from exploding alwasy at the last second! yeah for over hyped movies ! 
 My child is in 3rd grade and must look up synonyms.  Very few of the words on her lists are in this book.  This is not a helpful book at all.  I guess I should buy an adult thesaurus for 3rd grade 
 How on Earth Casper Van Diem accept to shoot this film I will never know. IT's a joke, unfortunately not a good joke ... Special effects ? Forget it. Good acting ? THe actors seem to never have heard about it. A plot ? Nosense. What is this, can somebody tell me ? The so called "sharks" don't scare even a three-year old child ! 
 This book is an innaccurate version of events in the the discovery of teh structure of DNA. What most people don't know is that Rosalind Franklin was crucial to the discovery of the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick actually stole most of her data via Wilson, her supervisor, adn passed it off as their own discoverery.  She was a brilliant scientist and should have been an independent researcher at Kings College, but because she was a woman she was made an assistant to Wilson. She was extremely dedicated and plowed through all the obstacles at Kings College. However, her supervisor, Wilson, showed most of her data to his old friend Crick, who shared it with his partner Watson. They too were studying DNA, although they were on completely wrong track. The data that was pilfered included the famous photo 51, which Franklin obtained over a course of years' work and revealed the spiral shape of DNA. They also positioned the competent of DNA, such as the bases, exactly as she hypothesized. Watson, Crick, and Wilson received the Nobel Prize, while Franklin could not, because she died at the age of 38 due to radiation exposure from the X-rays she used to capture photo 51. The men only mentioned her in passing when accepting their prize, and definitely not as the source of the actual discovery. Then Watson had the gall to write a book that casts her in a horrible light, as an inferior person who was bad tempered and selfishly hoarded her information. He also calls her `Rosy' throughout the entire book, although she despised that name. He once even went up to Rosalind and demanded that she hand over her data. He was a complete bigot, and thought her inferior and was furious when she refused to share her own findings to him. He harps about her appearance in the book, and it is obvious that is the only way he perceives her, and not as a thinking person. And for the record, she was actually quite striking, and wore the latest in French fashions. She was extremely dedicated, and her level of determination would have been completely accepted in a man. That's why I give this book a one, and if I could I'd give it a zero. Watson is just begging for comeuppance for what he wrote in this book. I would reccomend reading other books about Rosalind's struggle, such as 'Rosalind Franklin: The dark lady of DNA' 
 This book seems to be written for kids. I do not consider myself as techie, but this book is realy fiction reading before sleep: 
 I have been very disappointed in this 5th Cape Light Novel. It is slow and boring. I am usually a VERY fast reader but it has taken me 4 weeks and I am still not finished with this one! I loved the first 4 books in this series but I think it is time  to finish the series and be done with it. James is not a very interesting character and NOT hero material. While I have been wondering at Leigh's past, there hasn't been enough mystery to capture my attention for very long. Emily and Dan's marriage plans are boring also. About the only interesting thing that has happened yet is Jessica and Sam's child issues. I have found myself skipping parts and that says a lot for this book. Overall, the first 4 books in this series deserve 5 stars and this one....well...you should quit while you're ahead. 
 Prophet writes this book as a fanatic, with blinders on. She leaves absolutely no margin for other possibilities as to the interpretation, translation, or social anthropology of the time.  While it is widely known that the Catholic church edited the bible and destroyed many of the books relating to the old testament, the book of Enoch alone does not solve any riddles, puzzles, or mysteries. So much so for book by Prophet. 
 I bought this book based on the rating's. Once it arrived i sold it as a used book on amazon within 5 minutes. If you need a book in the bathroom to keep you occupied, or if you want to see 1 or 2 good dog pictures. Then by almeans buy this book. But if you are a serious photographer then pass this on by. The best part about this book was the B&W photo of the pug. Plus i broke even when i resold it 
 This book is horrible.  It is not true to the original classic stories!  Most of the endings, of the stories I've read so far, are different. I don't care for the illustrations either.  I was very dissapointed.  I bought this for my neices, and didn't read the book until they came to visit me, and by then it was too late to return this book. It's basically going in the trash 
 I was very displeased with bookbestdeal.  I had ordered and paid for a hardback version of the book and I received a paperback version.  I went to class and also discovered that our school had listed the wrong version of the book and that I would really nead the ninth edition.  I contacted bookbestdeal immediately and they basically stated that it wasn't their problem and that they would not accept a return.  Now I am forced to sell the book myself in order to recoupe the money I have lost.  Very unprofessional.  I will never purchase from them again 
 I didn't find this book very helpful. What it refers to as "advanced topics" such as persistent storage and networking are basic concepts that aren't explained very clearly. Seems put together too quickly with only average coverage of j2me 
 Our department has been repeated spammed by the author in a pathetic attempt to sell his theory and book. Do you really want to read a book by someone desparate enough to spam Astronomy departments everywhere? I can tell you for a fact now that this book as no legitimate claim to science. Instead he manipulates big words and concepts to confuse the general public. Don't waste your money or time on this book! 
 A book that is very poorly written, doesn't present any valuable and thoughtful information, focuses on many other external and quite secondary issues - Anne's issues, very repetitive on many occasions, and extremely poorly executed.   In my opinion, as other reviewers have already mentioned, Anne was simply struggling to get into the spotlight most likely because her life was quite insignificant, and she was dying for attention. Anne is a person with many, many issues herself, which makes it difficult for her to write a story about someone else without bringing the focus over and over again onto her and her life as whole. It seems as Anne's main reasoning for writing this book is to assure her readers how closely she grew with her biological mother and how close she was with Laci and her brother Scott (if she really was that close - where did all the loyalty toward her biological mother and brother go?!!! The spotlight was more important, I guess!). When one reads the book, one can gather that she wasn't close at all but wanted and wished that she were -- for the same reason that I mentioned in the beginning -- just to be in the spotlight.   The list -- I didn't understand why the book's title was chosen to be named after that silly two pages of writing, which is probably the worst part of the book to begin with. The things that are listed are as a reasoning of a 10-year old kid. An adult could, and when writing a book, should do better!   This book is artificial, exaggerated, and childish-reasoned! It is just another way of trying to bring some variety into someone's quite boring and monotonous life. 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 Sports and movies - should be a PERFECT combination.  Especially a story of a true sportsman, a true gentleman of the game, someone who loved to play the game for the game itself.    But this movie doesn't spend enough time telling us about the real Bobby Jones.  It leaves us hanging and wondering. There is one point where he is playing with a woman golfer and she is refered to as his girlfriend - WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?  At another point, he is in the hospital, temporarily banned from the game.  Then flip to him writing a letter of apology, then flip to him playing golf.  Well what happened to the hospital stay?  What happened to his ailment?  How did he get better, is it a long time/term disability?  Later, he and his wife are arguing over him going to another tournament and then PRESTO there they both are at the match.    Scenery - beautiful.  Story - while interesting it leaves viewer disappointed.  It should just be, could just be so much more.  
 There are enough reviews of the main movie story so I don't need to add anything in that regard.  But, what on earth does a lesbian sub-story (in both regards) have to do with the story as a whole?  Nothing.  So, we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the Appalachian way of life that, instead, heads for the trash bin 
 I have three young kids and have read hundreds of children's books. Rock Steady appears to have been written by someone who was intoxicated. This book does not make sense. It is poorly written. I can see no purpose in writing a book this bad let alone purchase it. I have thrown my copy in the trash 
 This book has an interesting premise, adventure journey in the depths of winter into the harshest gales with the most foolhardy of fishermen on the North Seas. It's not an easy read, the narrative is disjointed and erratic.  It's difficult to comprehend the purpose of most of the author's rambling passages other than to give you that woozy sense of nausea.  At that, it succeeded. Like some of the other readers, the most pleasure I had from this book was realizing that I did not have to finish it 
 While the concept was certainly revolutionary at the time this book was written, I found the story itself uninteresting and sexist.  I would not recommend this book. 
 This is the worst wrestling bio book ever and for one very good reason: there is no wrestling in it! Oh yes, sorry, about 50 pages out of 300 are about wrestling... The rest of the book is meaningless... I am sorry I ever bought it.. 
 Trying out a moderate position that lets him have his conservative genius  Shakespeare in quotes and so eat it too, Bate has written a lifeless,  boring account of Shakespeare.  The prose is wooden.  The book is so  tedious I confess I didn't get through much of it 
 Dee Brown's The American West is the poor consolidation of three distinct books. The resulting consolidation reflects differing types of organization and style.   It is a series of disjointed, non sequential often unrelated vignettes that ramble across the Western American landscape. Focusing primarily on the West that occurred after the Civil War, it addresses a period of continual evolution, of transition between Native Peoples and their non native counterparts, between law and lawlessness and from one ecological state, wilderness, to farming, ranching and settlement.  But for all its lack of organization, continuity and sometimes poor writing quality, it is a book that manages to entertain and inform. Be prepared for some serious Native American bias. It appears the Mr. Brown feels the West should have never been developed to become the amazing part of America that it has become, but rather should have been left to Stone Age peoples in perpetuity.   It is a very quick read with lots of simple sentences and even simpler logic that in a very direct way can evoke a reasonable amount of sympathy for the author's agenda. This bias can and does effectively cloud what really happened.  
 I've seen "Arena Rock" used quite a bit to describe Asia.  Although I don't generally agree with the term, I can certainly see where it comes from.  Asia didn't move too far away from its debut release when these tunes were composed.  If you liked their first album, you will likely enjoy this one as well.  For a bit more in-depth coverage, I'll say that I don't like Alpha nearly as much as the debut.  Perhaps it's because I was hoping for a bit of growth and an effort to reach beyond what they accomplished with "Asia".  There are a few somewhat remarkable tunes on this album, though.  I would recommend "Don't Cry" (which everybody has probably heard) and "Eye To Eye".  The best tune on this album, though, has got to be "The Heat Goes On".  It has that same drive and fantastic guitar work from Steve Howe that wooed me with "Time Again" from the first album.  Unfortunately, a few good songs can't lift this album anywhere above a two-star release.  The rest of the songs range from the mediocre (e.g. "The Heat Goes On", "True Colors" and "Open Your Eyes") to the outright painful, such as "My Own Time", "The Last To Know" and "Midnight Sun".  Generally, Steve Howe's presence is much less obvious on this release and is typically replaced with keyboard work from Geoff Downes.  The good thing is that Downes is an engaging artist, albeit not nearly as much as Howe.  This album is probably worth getting if you are a big Asia fan.  Otherwise, beyond their first album, there is plenty of generic '80s rock to go around.  Look elsewhere 
 I sent Amazon.com two different checks at two different times to purchase this CD and a DVD from one of those so called sellers.  I have bought new stuff from Amazon.com before, but this time I wanted to try and buy stuff from one of those sellers since Amazon.com did not have any of those items that I wanted in new.  I contacted Amazon a long time ago requiring one of my checks, and was told that they did not know anything about it. Then, I contacted them again recently, but was told that the seller(s) did something illegle, so I will not be getting my items.  I was told that since I sent checks, I will not be getting any refunds from Amazon.com.  I made both of my checks to Amazon.com and sent it to their address, so I thought since they forwarded my payments to that person or them, they were responsible for my payements.  I tell you what, I will never do business with Amazon.com ever agian from now on 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 Good-but not very relastic Dixion really should have bothered to look at the state of the world in the last 65 million years, because their are events that would still have happened. For example, birds would not have become extinct, neither would the mammals, both were doing very well. Also, the Pterosaurs would be extinct, or close to it 
 The music on this collection is great for an introduction to Lester Young, but unfortunately there seems to have been no effort taken to remaster the cuts here and everything sounds as if you were playing it on the original 78s. I know some people say you can't give this disc a low rating due to the fact that these are recordings from the 30's and 40's. Well, I say you can when there are other discs out there of the same material with sound quality that is far superior to what is offered here. If you want a good introductory disc of Pres that has a lot of material and is not too expensive check out the album "Lester Young: From A Cool Perspective." You get over 40 songs on two discs for around $17 and the sound quality is excellent on all the cuts, especially by 1930's and 40's standards. 
 While I'm sure the people behind this are well-intentioned, my kids begged to listen to anything but this saccharine and tedious CD.  Don't purchase this unless your children have never before heard quality music 
 This is utter rot. Another stinker from the withered pen of MCall Smith. Plotless, overly peppered with Mr McCall Smith's book of quotations, up-tight, and worst of all - boring.  Mr McCall, don't give up the day job 
 This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant "homemaker". If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too 
 I purchased this DVD hoping it would relay information on coral reefs and the myriad of life living in them.  While the focus of the movie was on the endangerment of the reefs due to global warming, overfishing, etc., most of the movie was spent above the water focusing on the the filmmaker and his wife and their trivial lives.  The imagery was beautiful when they were under the water, but it's only a small percentage of film.  Very disappointing 
 I would have been laughing at the writer's "analysis" and "conclusions"... .were it not such a dangerous period in world history, and our nation's security. Yes, radical Islam is a theat to America, to you as a Christian or Jew and to ME, even as a Muslim American.   Instead of using this avenune to show racist colors and bigoted slants, the author should have focused on the real insidious threat we face... the INFILTRATION of American politics by Zionist and Israeli agents and supporters being just one example.  Or the daughhters of Zionist supporters who "intern" for American politicians, from Bill Clinton to Gary Condit, insidiously influencing and corrupting our nation's politics.... THAT is INTIMATE INFILTRATION of America.  Nut job AND merely America-hating Muslims are a problem that have to be dealt with. But they are merely a drop in the ocean compared to what others are doing to us and our country.   For example, Israel is the ONLY US "ally" that has ACTIVE SPIES in the USA and who DO get CAUGHT. Then Israel asks for them to be pardoned.... all while MY tax Dollars (and YOURS) are going to keep them afloat.   What we need is a book that discusses INFILTRATION by anyone not devoted to the UNITED STATES of America.... whether Jewish Zionists, Christian Fanatics, Communist Activists, Fanatic Hindus OR Radical Muslims.... this book is NOT it.  Thanks. 
 I received the book, but not what I was expecting.   The book was advertised as a hardback, but the book received was paperback.  The book was an international edition, and not for resale in North America 
 I really wish I had read the book flap before buying this book.  Had I read that it had anything to do with NASCAR, I would have put it down and spent my $25+ on another book....my mistake.  The ONLY reason I actually read the whole book is because I did pay $25+ for it and just felt like I should.  It was not entertaining and just dragged on and on.  So, not only was it dull and slow, it was about NASCAR...a sport and subject that is just not my cup of tea.  I love the Stephanie Plum series and will continue to purchase Evanovich books in that series, but will not buy anything else 
 I grew infuriated (and bored) with this novel when I discovered that, about halfway through, that it had no idea where it was going. The small elements of the book that deliver actual story are some of the most engaging efforts at fiction I have come across in years. It is genuine, deeply interesting, and swolen with careful, careful writing.   Unfortunately, "In the Skin of the Lion" strays far too often into a kind of lazy poetry-prose, a landscape where every notion is ephemeral and fleeting. In some parts, this book is not so much a novel but a dull soliloquy on the helplessness, bravery and romance of the people we are supposed to be interested in reading about. 
 I read this book and find it poorly written.  The Author has no real story line, he keeps going off in different directions and never keeping to the story at hand.  He puts too much junk into it.  First rule of any writing - keep it simple and straight to the one and leave the fluff out 
 The author was fairly comprehensive in this book, covering everything that beginning and intermediate-level ice anglers NEED to know for safety, comfort and fishing success.  However, after reading half the book I had to put it down due to the overwhelming support the author gives to his obvious sponsor, HT Enterprises.  HT does make good equipment, but this book is blatently biased toward their products and the reader is literally pummelled with free advertising for their products.  I almost liken this to some TV fishing shows that are obviously paid advertisements cloaked in the veil of good ol' boy entertainment.  Consequently, after forcing myself to read the rest of this book, this angler had a bad taste left in his mouth and is wishing he had purchased a different title 
 The "stick to Fallout Boy"-esque comments are just silly.  If you want to listen to noise for nearly an hour go ahead.  This is one of the worst LPs ever recorded.    All I could think of when listening to this CD was a hilarious wiki page mocking a fictional industrial band from Finland, who hide behind fire hydrants and record the sound of dogs urinating, among other things that don't belong in a review.  But then I guess I'm just too much of a pea brain to appreciate the depth of this follow-up.  Please.  Get over yourselves.  I hated the debut when I first listened to it, but it is near the top of my favorite albums of the decade now.  The difference?  THE DEBUT WAS MUSIC!  The irony (ironidence) here is not in the music itself, but that the album is a perfect reflection of the band - which is no band at all.  When your lead singer broods in a corner all day and doesn't even speak to the rest of the band, it should come as no surprise that they record an album that sounds exactly like three year-olds on a play date - or an industrial band 
 She is a LIAR!  John 3:13 "No man hath ascended unto heaven except He who came down from heaven"  Acts 2:34 "David has not ascended unto heaven" Hebrews 11:39 "none of the patriarchs have received the promise"  This book is just more fantasy propaganda from the church of Mystery Babylon, Mother of Harlots.  This is damnable heresy from a false prophet (2 Peter 2:1)   
 Well, with 2001's "Planet of the Apes," we have yet another totally unneccesary remake.  No, not reimagining, a remake.    Just another jumbled mess of a remake.  There's Mark Wahlberg stepping into the Heston role of the original film.  The film opens with Wahlberg in orbit somewhere, then he very quickly crash lands on the ape planet.  But if you want to go to the kitchen at this point to get something to eat, pause the DVD, because if you don't, you might miss Mark getting captured, taken to the ape city, and thrown in with the other human captives, who are all intelligent and capable of speech.  So there's no explanation as to why the humans didn't formulate plans to put up a formidable resistance to the apes, years ago.  In the original film, the humans were like animals, so there was the explanation in the original film.  The remake offers no explanation.  But it took Mark to rally the human masses in this film, and they eventually escaped and revolted, in some jumbled mess of a climax to the movie.  The whole movie is just a jumbled mess, complete with two-dimensional (two might be a little too generous) characters we don't feel for, or care about -- including Wahlberg's character.  And forget any character development, or any mysterious trek across a 'forbidden zone.'  Everything in Burton's remake happens in a flash, so fast, that you never even grasp what just happened while you're watching, and you really don't care that much about what just happened, because it probably wasn't much anyway.  The "Planet of the Apes" franchise was not Tim Burton's intellectual property, so if it was his idea to make this remake, I'm guessing he had to get permission from the current copyright holder.  But my point here is a question: Does anybody in the entertainment industry ever say "no" to anybody else IN the industry anymore?  Did the copyright holder read the script of this remake before he gave it the greenlight?  All I'm saying is that I just don't get why the copyright holders, or the original creators of the franchise, just sit back and give these outside directors a blank check to do whatever they like, and let the franchise be brought down by these terrible remakes.  You would think that Heston wouldn't even want to appear in this, but he did.  Come on, the industry can't be this hard up for money.  I just don't get it 
 Am I The only ones who actually liked nelly's first album, I Thought it had charm, style, grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance, you thought it mean something, but this is just a lame gimmick from the start, I Mean there are some moments and some good songs (including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer), but the rest are just horrible, there is nothing else about this album that I Can engage with nor cared about and who cares?  Country Grammer was funny and good, this one's an utter disaster.   One of the worst albums of the decade. 
 Having had the miserable pleasure of being "taught" by Joan Cashin at The Ohio State University I can tell you that this book is as dry as her hair.  Has anyone seen the original movie for Great Expectations?  Cashin is the original Mrs. Havishome.  If only she would immolate in that wedding dress and save us all the 20 dollars we spent on this book 
 I was very disappointed in the content. There were not enough color plates and transparency in the color was lacking. Many of the instructions were used with black and white sketches and plates. Many of Kautskys subjects and scenes appeared to me to be "pre watercolor career" pencil sketches which I recognized.  Dark somber and sparse in my opinion 
 I have an extensive math background and found this book tough to read. Not because the math described is particularly complicated (it is most definitely not...high school algebra is sufficient), but because Ross' writing style is too verbose. 99% of readers should know the meaning of "average," yet Ross devotes a lot of text to explaining this concept. I'm not sure who his audience is. Math-savvy people may feel that concepts have been dumbed-down and over explained, but math-phobic people may be scared off by the use of formulas...and the majority of times they aren't really needed anway 
 This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of "Oprah Book Club" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak.   
 The best way of persuading people to accept misinformation is to mix it with some credible information. And so Dore Gold demonstrates with this anti-U.N. screed.   Not an adamant fan of the U.N. myself, I began my reading already familiar with organization's questionable track record, replete with institutional corruption and bureaucratic ineptitude. This book, I hoped, might use the ample failures of the U.N. to issue a fair indictment and perhaps show the way to a more accountable and responsible international body.   What I got instead was propaganda from a former Israeli ambassador with an extremely large political axe to grind. Instead of allowing his conclusions to be dictated by the facts, Gold seems bent on ramming a pre-packaged conclusion down readers' throats -- that the U.N. "fans the flames of chaos" and "supports terrorism and terrorists" -- by selectively cherry-picking anecdotal cases, removing them from their political context, and hoping that most readers know so little about his examples that they will leap blindly from his shaky evidence to his conclusion.    Moreover, his decision to use the hashest possible language in accusing the U.N. of abetting terrorism and spreading chaos seems to reveal a personal hostility to the U.N.  This is, of course, speculation.  But what is not speculation is that the quality of his argument is lacking, perhaps due to the fact that it issues from a visceral reaction rather than a rational analysis.  As already stated, his thesis itself is questionable.  Rather than to accuse the U.N. of worthlessly neglecting to handle international crises in an adequate manner, Gold is adamant that the U.N. actually goes beyond that and *contributes* to the crises, chaos, and terrorism.  As a later reviewer notes, Gold specifically states, "**By not adequately dealing with** the conflict in Bosnia, the UN fueled the Balkan crisis, which eventually spilled over into Kosovo and Macedonia. The failures in Rwanda fueled a massive central African war in which five nations invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where approximately 2.5 million people died in the next four years. And as Iraq flagrantly violated UN resolutions on [WMDs], Libya, Iran, and North Korea ignored the UN's international control system on nuclear weapons [p. 224]" (asterics added).  But this claim is not analagous to "fanning the flames of chaos," which implies contributing to a condition through one's actions, rather than one's inactions.  It is more appropriate to say that the U.N., by "not adquately dealing" with these situations, is simply neglecting to stamp out the fire. Yet Gold is content to let his highly inflammatory accusations stand, as though the U.N. were helping Iraq to hide its weapons programs or were passing out machetes to the Rwandan Hutus.   If his thesis were merely that the U.N. fails to stamp out the flames of chaos, he would receive little serious argument.  He would, however, have to account for his analysis of why the U.N. is ineffective.  Gold's explanation of why the U.N is ineffective is that anti-democratic nations have come to dominate the body as its membership has expanded over the past half-century.  However this theory does not square with the examples he cites to prove the U.N.'s impotence.  For example, he mentions the failure of the U.N. to mobilize peacekeepers in Rwanda in 1994, and the utter impotence of U.N. "observers" who did nothing to stop the slaughter of Bosnian teenagers at Srebrenica in 1995.  Gold is correct that the U.N. was quite ineffective in both situations, but he does not give the true reason why:  the U.N. was acting within the constraints laid down by the Western states that Gold claims are so powerless and outnumbered in today's U.N..  In the case of Rwanda, the United States refused to acknowledge that genocide was even taking place.  In the case of Srebrenica, the UN "peacekeepers" sat idlely by because the Security Council -- dominated by Western nations (the "perm five") -- permitted the use force only to protect the humanitarian convoys whose presence the West was using as an excuse not to intervene militarily.  In both cases, assigning blame to the U.N., while only occasionally and sporadically hinting at the policies of individual Western nations, paints a highly inaccurate picture of the U.N.'s failures.  In these two cases, the inaction of the U.N. at mobilizing blue helmets reflected the wishes of wealthy Western states of the Security Council, not the Pakistans or the Irans of the U.N. General Assembly.  In other words, the West was handicapping the U.N., not the other way around as Gold tries to convince his readers with selective interpretations of history.  How ironic that in making his case against the U.N., Gold mentions historical examples that disconfirm his own thesis, and show why the U.N. has truly come close to irrelevance.  Gold also expends a great deal of intellectual effort into implicating the UN by association. Because officials of the U.N. like Kofi Annon have routinely met with leaders like Mugabe or Castro, readers are to believe that the U.N. is responsible for granting legitimacy to them and, thus propping up their "terroristic" and despotic regimes. Though interacting with leaders does grant them legitimacy, sometimes it is the only viable option.  Western leaders routinely meet with the heads of authoritarian regimes in the interests of peace and stability. What is worse, they often do so for sheer personal political or economic gain.  Gold is strangely silent on the fact that Rumsfeld was shaking hands with the Butcher of Baghdad as he was gassing Kurdish villages with chemical we sold him.  He also neglects to mention that Arch-conservative Richard Nixon visited Mao Tse Dong in 1972. Japan and South Korea, long-time American allies, conduct talks with Kim Jong-Il, charter member of the axis of evil, not because they support his regime, but because they understand that ignoring it is not a realistic option. One wonders why Dore Gold would be annoyed at the UN's disproportionate fixation with Israel's behavior, when he disproportionately criticizes UN diplomats for meeting the very same disreputable figures that Western nations have talked to for years.   This critique ultimately falters because it presupposes a balance of power in the U.N. that does not correspond to the body's structure.  The United Nations is a Western contrivance, depending on and thus controlled by Western regimes.  Nothing can get done without the unanimous approval of the U.K., France, the U.S.A, and Russia (as Gold very well knows, having watched in person many U.S. vetoes of Security Council resolutions condemning Israel).  Gold's constant allusions to obscure details regarding the U.N.'s minimal and loose associations with terrorist groups and authoritarian governments misses this big picture -- the bigger picture which is capable of producing the truly important lessons.  About the only thing that one can take away from this book is that Gold hates the U.N.  One easily realizes this from reading the title of the book, however, and need not even pay twenty dollars.  Of course the U.N. is not the panacea for all of the world's political ills, but this book does not even come within shouting distance of the many, far more complex reasons why. 
 This is a pleasant film to look at as far as the pretty girls and the colorful scenes.  However that's about all the good things I can say about it.  I can think of a lot better things that the pretty girls in this movie could have done besides getting their faces burned off, getting killed by a walking suit of armor, etc..  There's a diary involved but what exactly is in this diary I still have no idea.  Maybe I lost something with the English dubbing.  Once I lost the point about the diary there was no hope of understanding the plot.    There's some cocaine use involved somewhere but where that all fits in I don't know.  The ending is anticlimactic and really not possible from a logical point of view.  I don't want to ruin the 'suspense' by  telling what happens.  Based on reading the high praises of other reviewers I may not be sophisticated enough to appreciate this movie.  Give me "Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman" or "Brides Of Blood" any day over this movie.  Jeff Marzano  Recommended further viewing:  Horror Hotel IT !

 I just threw this book away.  Not even worth trying to re-sell. Wish there were negative stars for ratings ....   I got this book when we decided to give IVF a try and maybe my mistake was getting this book after 1 1/2 years of infertility treatments.  The information in the book was very dated.  Reading through the author's experiences was extremely traumatic for me, but after spending a day upset over 'how bad' the book made the IVF process seem, I realized that a large part of the author's bad experiences came from her having doctors who might have been the best medical doctors ever but who had little compassion for their patients.  And then reading through her incessant whining about how much she hated needles .... Infertility is a medical condition, but no one was forcing her to take shots nor was her life riding on that medicine (unlike many people who have to take shots of life-saving medicines every day).    Even her bluntness was annoying sometimes.  Her "sorry, but that's the way it is" writing style might truly reflect her experiences, but my 2 years of infertility treatment experiences have not been like that.  There are many different types of infertility treatments and many different styles of REs/doctors.  You do not have to put up with competent but uncompassionate medical care.    
 Like W.D. I felt that the novel was lengthy with characters that simply cluttered the landscape. Tragedy after tragedy unfolds: a kidnapping of an ellitist; a run on a bank; a near-stock market crash; Hong Kong's world-famous floating restaurant catches fire, burns, and sinks; a mud-slide that destroys a prominent hotel; a chinese-communist espionage plot; a soviet espionage plot; secret-agents, double-agents, triple agents (do I need to go on)! All of this occurring within ten days, but the reader loses sense of the time since the book is so time consuming. I was fascinated with Clavell's Taipan and was further interested in the exploits of the Struan family. This was a disppointment! Dunross, the present Taipan, moves through novel with a killer business instinct and brief instances of compassion and humanity. Why does he do it? He is trying to live up to a legacy. That's it. In one sentence that is as deep as Dunross goes. The novel Taipan was so different in development of its characters. Dunross'one-sentence purpose for living, when contrasted with Dirk Struan's vision of the Noble House helping China become a world power was completely lacking. Clavell's earlier work was very insightful about China especially in its potential influence. However, the parade of characters in Noble House is similar to a chinese all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant: plenty of food, but lacking in authentic taste. Overall the work was very tiring and uninspiring. Nothing noble about it at all.   
 since there is little to no mystery involved in the story.  I should have expected this, since this has been the trend for the last 4 or 5 books in the series.  I had put off reading this one for precisely that reason but needed something to read for the weekend so I decided to give it a try.  The best thing that can be said about this "Turkey" is that it's a quick read, so it's good for a plane ride, but if you want something that remotely resembles a mystery pass this one up and read one of the first books by this author which really were engaging and satisfying mysteries.    Even as a glimpse into the small town life of Moose County this one falls flat.  It used to be that one of the charms of the series was the way Braun had developed the world of Moose County and all the foibles of its inhabitants and if tragedy struck one you really felt for them.  In this book, characters from previous books are randomly introduced and they wander around aimlessly and there is no emotional depth to Qwill's relationship with any of them.     The other problem that has happened to the series is that Braun fell in love with her own character.  Qwill started the series as a flawed charcter.  In "Turkey" there is even more rapturous description of Qwill's mustache and wonderful voice than usual, not to mention the ovations for the ridiculous Big Storm production.  We are supposed to believe that it is so well received that there are to be several performances a week throughout the summer - how big is the population of Moose county?    SPOILER ALERT:  But to cap off the ridiculousness of this book, Qwill leaves his beloved Koko out in the gazebo with a confessed murderer who is strung out on drugs.  The Qwill of past books would never have intentionally put either cat in danger like this.    According to her fan club web page, she was born in 1916 so now she's pushing 90.  It's possible she's in poor health. Because of this I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and agree with those who suggest this book was ghost-written based on notes she made.  That would account for inconsistencies in plot and style.  The only good part of this book - the only reason it deserves even one star - is the description of YumYum playing with her thimble (but even it is taken from another of Braun's books).  It's on page 72 - read it, then find something else to read.          
 How appropriate that beds are on the cover, as this is the first of Pink Floyd albums that qualifies as just a collector's item for Floyd fanatics and will positively put anyone else (and some fanatics like myself) to sleep. There are so many great Floyd albums, don't buy this one unless you are curious about the "bad Floyd album" and want to see if it could really be that bad... it is not that it's terrible, but just for Floyd, it is extremely mediocre 
 The movie is cool because it offers different surfing than normally seen in surf movies, but I buy surf films to watch over and over. Which I would not do with this movie. Just not enough action. 
 I don't usually bother reviewing things but I had to say something about this. First off the positives: it is hard and demanding. My muscles were sore the next day. That's it. The negatives? Well, let's start with the completely amateurish presentation. She may be fit but she comes across as if she doesn't have a clue what she's talking about. She doesn't do mirror cueing which I think is a basic requirement. In the cardio intervals, she has to take breathers so just as you're ready to go onto the next move you have to stop to let her catch up with you. Some of the moves in the cardio intervals I think are not good for lower backs - lots of bending down, touching the floor and back up again sort of thing. The stretch section at the end is useless. You don't stretch your upper body at all and all the weights sections are for upper body.  And then they finish off with a water fight while some manic bloke shouts 'you did it' over and over again at her.  If you can ignore her and switch off before he jumps out you will get a good workout. But there are plenty of challenging DVDs out there which are much more professional 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 Harrison writes as though he desperately wishes he had something interesting to say, but knows that he does not.  To cover this lack (including that of a decent story) he attempts to copy the writing style of some of Samuel Delaney's more chaotic books, but with none of Delaney's flair.  Nearly all of the book is tedious and filled to bursting with boringly insipid gratuitious sex and violence.  Sadly, his characters also lack plausable motivation for their actions.  There is little internal coherence to the story, and far too much reliance on attempted shock/weirdness value to carry the story, such as it is.  It takes Harrison some 200 pages out of a 300 page book to finally start telling the story the way he should have been doing  from the beginning.  The only reason I give it a star at all is because of the last 50 to 90 pages and because of one idea he mentions in the last couple of pages.  I'm severely disappointed that so many of my current favorite authors reviewed this book so highly.  I can only think that they have a policy of not pissing off anyone who may later be asked to review one of their own books 
 This epilator by Emjoi does NOT WORK without the cord attached - the motor is too weak. In addition, the only disks that work at all are the two on the ends - the middle disks, since they are inset from the top, never reach the hair. I had to return this item, and I would not trust or recommend ANY item by Emjoi. Extremely poor quality, and does not work as promised 
 I purchased "ABC's of Newborn Baby Care" and another video called "Bringing Baby Home". The "ABC's" video uses a baby who is not a newborn. The umbilical cord is healed and the baby is at least three weeks old. The video does go over basic care of how to hold, change, dress a baby, bottle cleaning and baths, but skips over the details I would have found useful. "Bringing Baby Home" by the Liandrea Company is a much more complete video that uses actual newborns and parents (no actors)and covers a wider range of information. I do not recomment ABC's of Newborn Baby Care as anything but a suppliment to another video 
 I read this book,a couple years back and was somewhat skeptical,initially. I wondered if just measuring brain metabolism in certain areas can really give you a full picture of whats going on. Still,other parts of the book seemed to contain good advice and insights. After some discussion with family, I decided what the hell,and went ahead and got the pricey standard workup at the Amen Clinic, 2 SPECT scans, etc. Keep in mind that insurance does not cover this, at least not in my experience. The clinic was reasonably professional,although Dr Amen himself came off as quite pompous. He's also quite short,about 5'4. The prescriptions I was given did not make much difference in the 2-3 months I was on them. To get them renewed I would have had to travel a long distance back to the expensive Amen Clinic. My local pdoc did not have much respect for Dr. Amens reccomendations,(which I understand now)so in the end,it was a big waste. I later found out Dr Amen is a fundamentalist Christian,and is a fan of Pat Robertson. It didnt surprise me, as he didnt come off as a very tolerant person. I suggest you do a google search on "Dr. Amen" + "quack" to at least see both sides of the story. Im sure he has helped some people with SPECT,but in my case it was like throwing money down the drain. 
 Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums 
 As an esthetician I would advise against using these sort of products. They basically sand your face off. Please leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed professionals. I can assure you that I am not just saying this to drum up business.   I would much rather have people not do anything to their skin than to use a product like this. You initially see great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation, but believe me, you will pay for it in the long run. The main ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide (also referred to as corundum), which is characteristically known for its hardness, and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and as a component in cutting tools. This material is rated as 9 out of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making it second only to diamonds in abrasiveness. You may argue that this is also the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures, but you need to realize that these procedures can only be preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment. I see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and products, and they all have the same issue; It worked great at first, then after some time they started to notice that it wasn't working as effectively, so they used it more often and harder.  Exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right. When this process is done more often than necessary, or in an overly aggressive manner, you can end up damaging your skin and causing permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation. People don't seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason, it's there to protect and moisturize our skin. When you constantly cleanse and exfoliate your skin, you are doing more harm than good. Over stripping the skin causes irritation, break-outs, and heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed. When your skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation, it's defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection. So please, if you do use this, use extreme caution, don't use it on your face, and do not use it more than once a week, if that.   Ask any esthetician, plastic surgeon, or dermatologist out there and they'll tell you the same thing: there is a reason people don't get facials, chemical peels, and microderm every day, or even more once a month. The adage "too much of a good thing" stands true here.  if you need more convincing, please refer to the following links and make the decision your self.  [... 
 Chuck Jones continues to entertain new audiences with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo. I found it to be very exciting. If you have Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote The Classic Chase from Warner Bros. Golden Jubiliee 24 Karat collection, this video might not be for you. The other five cartoons actually appear on that video; Zip N' Snort, Operation: Rabbit, Hook, Line and Stinker, Beep Beep, and Ready, Woolen and Able. Otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages 
 A truly disappointing effort.  Alex lies regularly and with impunity to his client.  Milo is a pain. Way too inartfully drawn characters to keep up with, and, an absurd plot.  The dying nurse tells her adopted 19 year old daughter that she did something bad years before and on this slender fact Alex, Milo, Petra, the entire L.A. police department and a swat team are out there to catch an improbable psychopath.  To keep our interest the psycho kills a few unnecessary cypher creatures which provides a trail to his inevitable demise. Someone tell J.K. to spend some serious time with his next Delaware novel or I will be buying his next novel in the closeout bin 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 Bought one of these at Sears and was initially happy with it. But after a couple weeks of light use, the battery refused to charge. So I exchanged it at the store for a new unit. Used that one, again gently and according to the manual, for about a week--then it ceased working altogether. The player wouldn't turn on, whether on battery or mains power. Audiovox clearly has either design or quality control problems with this model. I suggest selecting a different model, and perhaps a different brand 
 I am a Panama (Just Cause) & Desert Shield/Storm vet, and after seeing the movie I read the book... well almost all of it.  This guy is a problem child PERIOD! Pissed off at the world, pissed off at life, and very lucky I didn't get my hands on him.  Snipers are crazy as another review stated, but this guy is that 5% of the Corps that that can give the other 95% a bad name.  Some of the boredom issues were true, wives/girlfriends dumping us was true, etc... but overall this guy just REALLY ticked me off... but THAT IS HIS GOAL IN LIFE ISN'T IT... Books about God, Country, Corps; things that are still thought, and observed by every Marine may just not shock the masses as much as a book aboutsome discontented, nonhacker, shiptbird. 
 I don't dispute Dr. Brazelton's advice on medical issues. On child care issues he seems like an aristocratic professor who handed off his own kids to wife and nanny and now sits in an ivory tower, smoking a pipe,dispensing common sense advice and collecting royalties. He just doesn't understand why you might not want your child in diapers and breastfeeding at age 3 or why the television might be on - in his world every child is an only child, and mothers don't work or have daycare providers like Mary Poppins. This book is just as arrogant and unrealistic as the other books he's written and the advice on breastfeeding problems could ONLY have been written by a man. The book in a nutshell: Don't sweat the vegetables - if your child gets enough milk and very little junk food, he'll be OK 
 After making a strong case that Boxers need specialized training, there seems to be little in it  particular to the Boxer.  I wonder if this is just an edit off one of the other Barron's books.  Two, the author pushes treats as training rewards, which many believe isnt the best.  Three, on some topics, like handling aggression, the author just punts - 'consult an expert.'  Not very helpful.  All in all, I prefer the Monks of New Skeet, and "The Art of Raising a Puppy. 
 Whilst some of the more profound and wide-ranging, far out, suggestions/conclusions of Phyllis Atwater may well be correct...this book is much more personal testimonial and intellectual autobiography than it is science or structured argument.  Often the author is found to be arguing by analogy...and yet the point about analogies is that "there is a difference" ie argument by analogy is often flawed.  I agree with  the suggestion the book is poorly structured.  I could immediately have found alternative ways of suggesting reasons for radically different world views...and I could have found more solid evidence that was more clearly and thoroughly documented.  Where are the references eg to McMoneagle or Radin or Robert Monroe 
 I read this for my M.A. in History, now I know why I never read it as a undergrad. It is a bit drawn out. I like Morgan, he is very interesting and I would say the same thing about Winthrop. But like Morgan sometimes does, he draws out Winthrop's story so much that you begin to forget what the original thesis was, a people striving to be perfect in an imperfect world. Morgan's thesis would have worked much more effectively as a Journal Article in the Journal of New England History. Although, Morgan's thesis might have been ground breaking in the 1960's, it is hardly earth shattering today. I didn't feel anymore educated about Puritans than I was before. It is a good book to reflect on how historians thought about 17th century New England before the 1960's but I didn't see much use for it beyond that. Morgan has made a fine argument, it is just too bad that it was so long winded that it could have been summed up in a journal entry 
 Mrs Peel preformed her magic in many more black and white episodes. I assume they were the (Lost) films. These were the episodes that she was adorned in her famous catsuit. I was disappointed when viewing this collection that it was advertized as complete when it is not. 
 I thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular.  It kept me awake but just on the verge.  The few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie.  I thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best. Overall I was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star.  
 This is perhaps the most liberal textbook I have ever read in my entire life. The authors come across as subjective and emotional, espousing the evils of capitalism and taking responsibility for one's own actions. 
 Replaces the Black & Decker GT300 HomeCafe coffeemaker's pod holder ONLY! 
 I agree with S. Haus.  I was also disappointed.  The interiors of the homes in the book are generally dark and unwelcoming (unlike the one on the cover).  I prefer the multitudes of other books that combine accurate colonial decorative schemes with a modern, lived-in feel, rather than something straight out of a tour of Benjamin Franklin's 18th century home.  Not sure why some other reviewers seem to attack the S. Haus review; makes me wonder if they know the author personally 
 Although my 3 1/2 yr old loves this belt, it barely fits him. It only fits him if he wears it under his shirt as big as it will go. In fact, my 1 1/2 year old wears it very close to the edge of the velcro. The smallest setting of the velcro barely fits our teddy bear. Also the magnifying glass does not actually magnify at all, and the compass is just a sticker of a compass face. My son loves it for the brief time it sort-of fits him, but I am disappointed with the quality, and the size 
 This would have been a good skit, or maybe a short story, but not an entire novel.  The book is tired like the town Wigfield 
 This album is disgusting. No musical talent.  This people are the farthest thing from musicians.  If you enjoy overproduced music, and a rip off of fellow label mates FOB and P!ATD - buy this.  It is boring and it is a weak attempt at a record.  Shaant can't sing either.  Go back to Buffalo 
 This book is terrible. It is nearly illegible. The text font is too small and too dainty. It lacks coherent explanation of concepts. It has very few examples and those that it has are not worked out in detail. The mathematical notation used is well horrible. This book's notation is so different from Chew's Waves and Fields in Inhomogenous Media (IEEE Press Series on Electromagnetic Wave Theory) and Kong's Electromagnetic Waves that equations are near unrecognizable. This is just another example of a book that is intended for reference only and not for the purpose of instruction. I am a Physicist whose speciality is electromagnetics and this book has inspired me to write a real textbook for this subject matter. I am not saying that there is not useful information in this book. It is just not explained coherently for students. If it were possible I would give this book 0 stars. Please do not waste your time and considerable money on this book. Buy Chews or Balanis Electromagnetics books instead. 
 Whoa...my sisters have this set at their house, which I used extensively last night to cut with. In a word? Terrible.   They have not used them much, and all they had for me was a glass cutting board (I know, terrible). Due to the glass cutting board, I knew these edges, had they been used, would not be terribly sharp.  I made a point of sharpening them on the included steel using the procedure outlined in the manual.  Anyhow, I found myself both struggling and TEARING vegetables when cutting them. To slice red pepper, I was having to pull the remaining portion of the pepper up to tear it off of the piece I *thought* I'd just cut.   Perhaps this is a terribly unfair comparison, as I am used to my Henckels Pro "S" set. But for crying out loud, I didn't think it would be THIS bad.  While I cannot speak for the rest of the Henckels "International" (meaning "Made in Spain, not Germany") line, this set was very much unacceptable. You would literally get a better value buying a Henckels 4-Star Chef's Knife instead of this WHOLE SET. At least you'd get some real use out of it.  The steak knives feel cheap. This is definitely a $60-feeling set, no great "value," in my opinion. I would never, ever, ever buy a Henckels International product after this interlude and will happily return home tonight to my Henkels Pro "S" set...where cutting through ANYTHING is like gliding through soft butter 
 The reviews published above are for Bonhoeffer's book, "The Cost of Discipleship."  The book shown above, however, is a STUDY COMPANION, and not the book itself.  Bonhoeffers' actual book, as marketed by Amazon, can be found by typing 0684815001 (the ISBN) into the search box 
 The book is 195 pages total.  The first 60 pages explain what CDS, z-spread, and asset swap spread are.  While this is useful information, chances are, if you are buying a book about CDS basis, you will already know this stuff.  And if you dont, wikipedia or any other online source can concisely explain it.    The last 50 pages includes definitions and appendicies.  In between, you get a lot of repetitive information.  Every chapter starts out with a 2-3 page summary of what you just read.    Chapter 3 is really the only useful part of the book - it outlines the 10 or so factors that drive basis.  I certainly learned a lot here but it was in the course of 10 pages or so.  The final chapter talks about "trading the basis."  I was disappointed to read that they are simply telling you how to execute the trade...ie, buy $10MM notional, sell X, hedge with futures.  It really doesnt help with idea generation which is what I was hoping to see. 
 I started reading this book with great anticipation but was soon disapointed, both with the plot and the description of ancient Egypt. The reader is not transfer to that era and place 
 After loving the first two entries in the series, I found this one lacking.  First, where was the 'chitz and china'...?  Emerald, whose, um, excuse the expression 'redneck' side seems to be increasingly emerging... needs to return to the shop!  I found this tome a bit rambling, seemingly not as well conceptualized as former entries and therefore not as well executed or as compelling. It also begins to seem we're seeing way too much of the boyfriend, who's pretty predictable and isn't a terribly interesting or well-developed character... I was also disheartened that the writer brought in one new and one returning character only to see them dropped without any real significance to the plot...  One 'donated' a crystal ball that also hardly figured in the plot and the other was an old boyfriend who appeared briefly, and then was never heard of again... What was that about?  Here's hoping future chintz and china mysteries are more akin to the first two than to this one...  I just picked up the 4th in the series, so I guess I'll see 
 As an expectant mother of bi-cultural, bi-racial, and hopefuly bi-lingual child, I am reading any kind of books which might help me. On the contrary to many praises, this book was a big dissapointment for me. The authors keep repeating the same thing chapter after chapter, and failed to give any concrete evidence to explain why. If you just want to read many bits and pieces opinions from bilingual children's parents, this may be the right book for you. I rather recommend "The Bilingual Family. 
 Was really looking forward to this 2nd installment in the series, but was disappointed for the most part. Check it out at the local library instead of buying, is my advice 
 Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun 
 While the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive.  What I think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics.  An example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter, but doesn't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together.  He just tells you that you need to tie them together.  What if you don't have a shoelace to use?  What other alternates are there?  This book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire, but it's not enough for the serious camper 
 Pearl Jam are more of a band of the 90s, and really they should of stayed their and done something else different because the last decent album they released was "Yield". Thats not to say "Binuaral" and  "Riot Act" are terrible albums its just the production on both of them is bad, Eddie Vedders singing is a bore and the songs just are'nt their, thats not to say you should not have them in your CD collection - hah!  As for this laughable Pearl Jam at the garden DVD, well that just reinforced why Pearl Jam are a band of the 90s, and back then they were an energetic and proper enthusiastic live band.  Since then it blatantly seems they have become slacker and boring, fatter and unexciting and older (which is no excuse) to be such a bore on the stage. You would never beleive how bad this band has disintergrated over the years.  No passion whatsoever, they just look like they are their for the moeny - which of course is a huge shame 
 i really liked the first one and even went to my mom's house to pick up the second one (this) at 10:30 at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on. from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page 120. not much has happened to make me want to finish it. very boring. not really into roz and mitch characters, i don't think they are very well developed, they seem kind of blah. and the story is kind of blah. blah, blah, blah, and just words for the blah, blah, blah going on and on.  
 This terrible movie has singing!  Bad singing, and lots of it!  Overacted, trite, and BORING!  All those good reviews, I thought it would be campy and cool, but it's NOT!  
 Returns and exchanges are very slow - process has taken a month so far 
 I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan, but this is a weak brew.  Sinatra phones it in (literally - he wasn't even in the same room with his duet partners), and few of the guests offer anything of value.  This is a marketing ploy, not an album - get any of the great Capitol releases from the 50s and learn why Sinatra was the Entertainer of the Century.. 
 It's an intriguing premise: a brilliant,disillusioned (and sometimes delusional) inventor heads out, along with his family, into the remote sub-tropics of Central America to forge a new society. That's the plot of the Mosquito coast, adapted from the novel by Paul Theroux and featuring an energetic performance by Harrison Ford, as well as a few virtually non-existant ones by the rest of the cast, and it works, up to a point. The movie is interspersed with a few fairly compelling moments, such as the confrontations between Harrison Ford's borderline psychotic inventor and the exploitative missionary who has journeyed to the sub-tropics to preach "God's word", and clearly has alot on it's mind, but is nevertheless meandering, predictable (the tone of the movie is essentially the same throughout; one of ominous foreboding. From the onset, we know that Ford's plan is doomed to fail), and texturally uneven, with Director Peter Weir and screenwriter Paul Schrader ultimately biting off far more than they can chew. 
 I am with the other people who reviewed this item stating that it is kinda pointless to be releasing a boxed set for this series. I know for a fact that they have been doing this since at least book 4 and each time the next book comes out they are just making the box bigger. This is just a huge rip off for the people who buy "boxed sets" for the novelty of the box...once the next book comes out they basically have to just set it on the shelf next to the boxed set. Personally, I think that for the most part the idea of putting your books in a box like this is kinda stupid anyway...I prefer to have mine individual on the shelves. I am not opposed to the idea of releasing them in nice slipcases though...anyway I'll quit my rambling. Lets just end it at this, if you are absolutely one of those peeps who need the box set, wait until the last book comes out and buy it then. The one star here is for the boxed set, not the individual books, which are all brilliant 
 This is not to knock this version for those who are yearning for a paragraph of commentary following every line or two of the Text, and DEFINITELY not to knock the Gita itself.  But I would think that the commentaries would come at the end of the chapters or on the facing pages, so I could enjoy and relish Yogananda's own translation (maybe his organization will come out with his straight translation, no commentary).  But for the shear beauty of the poetic translation of the Gita itself, I love the version of Eknath Easwaran (I confess to owning and loving most of his books, and especially love his Upanishads for the same reason) 
 Hi,   I have lost the CD rom to download the movie from the camera.  Sony does not offer it for free on its website. You have to pay $70 dollars to get it again.  That clearly disappoints me.  
 It seems like a good idea... 'Las Vegas Hillbillys,' a kind of a 'Krush Groove' for the possum pie and moonshine set, starring Jayne Mansfield and Mamie van Doren.  Duelling blonde bombshells, right?  Ah, no.  Van Doren is looking sad and puffy in this film as a 'tough' but disinterested saloon singer, longing for better days when she was straining angora sweaters and scratching out the eyes of good girls everywhere.  Jayne Mansfield sports a series of tentlike grandma dresses of the sort later found adorning the fashionable Weezie Jefferson, reading from cue cards with a kind of breathy, clueless abandon which is probably quite fetching when she's not dressed in a potato sack.  One can imagine her on her rendezvous with destiny, thinking, 'Oh no, we're about to slide underneath that semi truck!  But at least I won't have to think about 'Las Vegas Hillbillys' anymore.'  Between the two of them, they don't get more then seven minutes' screen time.  This movie is ostensibly a musical, in the sense that there is music in it, consisting of fifteen- or twenty-minute blocks of bad lip-synching (in an 85-minute film) which do nothing to advance the plot, such as it is.  Watch for Bill Anderson's all-KGB-agent backup band. 'We are American high-fashion models.'  I gave this movie a whole two stars because they *can* sing, after all... give them a break.  Richard Kiel makes a surprise appearance as, can you guess? a thug.  He actually has dialogue in this film, of a sort, and in watching his performance you really get a sense that unenthusiastically bunny-hopping between cable cars in 'Moonraker' represented the pinnacle of his acting career.  The plot: Woody Weatherby contemplates stardom, inherits a debt-ridden saloon from his uncle, goes to Vegas, tries to run the place, has a twenty-minute nap.  In the last ten minutes Aunt Clem magically fixes everything and starts a cream pie fight.  Van Doren kisses Ferlin Husky, thereby completing her descent to the innermost circle of Hades.  The End.  There was supposedly a sequel to this, 'Hillbillys in a Haunted House,' but I frankly am afraid to watch it.  Be my guest 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 I would've given this book 4 stars, but to link the trilobites to evolution this way is very misleading. The whole unbiased scientific community today advocates the "intelligent design theory". I thought that people who hallucinate darwinist pseudo-science only find room for their pens in commercial corporate pages. Use this book for information about trilobites, but use Harun Yahya's books to read about evolution first. They're legally available online for free even 
 I have to preface this by saying that I absolutely love eating at the candle. So delicious. before we moved from NYC, I thought we HAVE to get this book. We've tried several of the recipies, following them to the letter, and have been really dissapointed everytime - with the exception of the  hummus.  I think that they must be leaving out some key ingredients in a lot of these recipies, because all of the ones we have attempted have been either completely flavorless, or tasted like salt. Don't even bother with the soups unless you are a gourmet cook and can figure out how to punch them up somehow after following these directions, because they all end up runny and bland. so sad 
 tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper.  i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you.  but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality 
 The information in this book was pretty good, but for the price I paid, I was expecting a huge tome on wheels. At 75 pages, what I got was more like a pamphlet. I guess they justify the obscene price because it is branded by the Appraisal Institute.  I bought this book because I was interested in making the switch from owning and managing apartment buildings to owning and managing self storage. Maybe. For someone with experience evaluating apartment buildings or other commerical real estate, this "Pamphlet" will be interseting and helpful. Just don't pay more than $10 for it. For more on apartment buildings visit my blog. cil-my-landlord.blogspot dot co 
 I put one star because it's the minimum, if not, I would've gave it zero stars. This CD can be reviewed in so few words... here are some: NO!!! Don't Bad Stay Away from it I told you, NO!!!  In short, no music from the movie is here, and the music that is here... well, it might as well not be here, and it would it be better that way.   Summary: NO!!! don't get this CD, use the money in something else, get a hamburger or somethin 
 This is just a warning not to buy the censored version of this album. Make sure you get the proper version.  Tracks 4 and 8 of disc 3 have some horrible noise put on to mask the lyrics, which makes the songs unlistenable. It would have been better not to have put the tracks on the album than to release them in this format.  I would refuse to buy censored music on principle and it is a mystery to me why Prince, who spent years in a dispute with his record company over artistic freedom, should release censored music.   By the way, the music is wonderful and I recommend the album 100%. But make sure you don't buy censored music 
 This book was completely unfulfilling. It's hard to imagine a book that could be less useful for investors. Perhaps Costakos assumes that his potential customers are simpletons who don't know how the Internet works. Even so, his consistent proselytizing for his own online brokerage will annoy both neophytes and experienced traders alike 
 The 20% you need to know: This book is poorly written, and the author would do well to use the 80/20 principle in his writing.  The 80% that will make up the rest of the review: I have never read such boring prose. I've had the concept fully explained to me. I fully understand what the principle is. I have heard it about 80 times now when 20 would have been enough (actually, once would have been enough). Now, what do I do with it? How do I implement it into my life? I am now on page 53 and he still hasn't gotten around to that part. It seems to me he should have used the theory when writing this book. Cut to the chase! Give me the top 20% of useful information so I can go ahead and use it to increase my productivity and effectiveness by 80%. Instead I get the feeling I'm wandering around aimlessly in the bottom part of his bar charts among the 80% of fluff to fill up his book quota. How many stories about economists and computer software do we really need? I don't know about you, but I wanted to increase my productivity by using my time better, and reading this book so far has been a complete waste of it 
 As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman is, this production was a waste of time, space and money. Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves.  The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly.  It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's surprisingly close.  Please don't waste your time with this film 
 I WOULDN'T KNOW I NEVER GOT MY CD AND ITS BEEN OVER TWO MONTH 
 Is there any possibility of giving this book zero stars?  What a tedious and most forgettable read!  I completely agree with the previous customer comment; this book has more to do with the business peripheral to Paul, not Paul.  But in addition to that, Alan Clayson's writing style is absolutely torturous.    The entire book is composed of weak, endless, one-sentence paragraphs that meander across perhaps five subjects, adding clause upon wandering clause, dropping name over unknown name.  By the end, you have no clue what in the world you have just read.  I had to read and re-read it until I could decipher the text's meaning.  Alan, do yourself a favor and brush-up on your basic writing skills.  I learned more about Paul in one 45 minute interview with Larry King than from this effort by Clayson.  This book, unfortunately, is a complete waste of time, and makes Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag Archipelago" feel like a light and happy read 
 The book's premise was so promising -- how to find work that fulfills your higher calling.  The book just never fulfills that promise.  Just a lot of unmemorable writing about how you will be more fulfilled if your work is meaningful.  Well, that's not a shocker.  But how about some insight into how to find or how to create meaningful work.  For such a deep and spiritual topic, the thinking was very superficial.  The author merely rewrites what he has read elsewhere.  No new thinking.  Readers would be better off reading some of the books he recommends in his bibliography such as Flow and the books by Viktor Frankl.  I was also left with the icky feeling that the real point of this book was to sell you on his company's feel good workshops.  A real disappointment 
 Being a Saudi Arabian woman, I was totally amazed by the false information in this book. I don't think the author should write a book about a country when she lived there for few months. She missinterpreted so many things that happen regularly in our culture. She should know that women in Saudi Arabia choose to cover up. They are not forced to do so. The same thing goes to Catholic nuns, who choose to cover up for the sake of God. I think she should have talked to more educated Saudi women who could explain things better. She may have lived in a village where the majority were uneducated (that was in 1970's) and women were less fortunate. I'm currently working as an IT consultant in a huge company, my mother is a college professor and my father is really supportive and is proud of both of us. Nothing is stopping us from reaching our goals. I think people should look at a broader picture. I could have judged Americans by the acts of the KKK few decades ago. However, I lived in the US for two years with my husband, who is an engineer, and I had a chance to make good American friends. I cannot say all Americans are racists!! In concolusion, the book is a total waste of money. I do not recommend that anyone should buy it 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 very disappointed with this CD; only has about 2 songs on there that are worth listening t 
 Sure, these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but I give their functionality an F. As soon as I opened one of these cases to put a CD in it, the case broke. It happened to 3 cases out of the 12 I have used already. I wasn't using excessive force, in fact most people call me gentle. Buy at your own risk and HANDLE WITH CARE! 
 "Twist Around the Clock" (1961) was hurriedly made to capitalize on the new dance craze, the Twist. Columbia was in such a hurry to cash in that producer Sam Katzman simply took the script of the 1956 smash hit "Rock Around the Clock" and refilmed it almost verbatim. Most of the storyline and many entire dialogue sequences are lifted bodily from the older film. If you know "Rock Around the Clock," you'll find yourself reciting "Twist Around the Clock."  "Twist Around the Clock" is pretty low-voltage, despite guest-star turns by Dion (who lip-synchs "Runaround Sue," "The Wanderer," and "The Majestic"), The Marcels (not shown to best advantage with a mediocre rendition of "Merry Twist-mas"), Vicki Spencer (a Connie Francis wanna-be), and top-billed Twistmaster Chubby Checker. Chubby only has a few lines of dialogue but he is quite ingratiating in his limited role; his fans will be disappointed that he doesn't show up until the middle of the movie, and he doesn't sing his record hits "The Twist" or "Let's Twist Again." The plotline is handled by uninspired unknowns; John Cronin and Mary Mitchell do not distinguish themselves as the romantic leads, although Alvy Moore of "Green Acres" gets a chuckle or two in a deadpan comedy-relief role.  If you have to choose between the "Twist Around the Clock" and "Rock Around the Clock" DVDs, "Rock Around the Clock" is easily your better bet. "Twist Around the Clock" fares badly on all counts: the music is monotonous (not one of the "twist" numbers is memorable), the story portions between numbers are leaden, and the predictability of the whole enterprise will have you reaching for the fast-forward button. All this has going for it is an archaeological value: curious viewers can observe the Twist phenomenon in its original context, and film buffs can see for themselves just how much was stolen from an older and better movie. 
 But it's awfully simplistic and in some cases, wrong.  For example he claims based on some survey that we all consider time more valuable than money.  I disagree.  I think many people do consider time more important, while others, such as those struggling to get by on low-wage jobs and affluent workers who do a lot of overtime, value money more.  Very ambitious people also tend to value money, both for themselves and for their children.  IMO, that's part of why so many upper-class children have lives crammed with extracurricular activities:  so they can be "balanced" and go to Harvard, get a great job, and make good money.  The author also praises Advent and mentions that an Advent story is the Annunciation:  this is odd because the Annunciation is celebrated March 25, not in Advent.  Maybe what he meant is that people think of Mary's pregnancy and that brings the Annunciation to mind.  I don't know.    There are the usual preachy generalizations:  we are too selfish; we think of ourselves too much, etc.  I really doubt that me-me-me should have been the message the author got from his experiment in watching all that TV, when TV contains such an odd mix of stuff:  mindless entertainment, sports, distressing news, educational programs, commercials which do promote "me," and "after-school specials."  What bothers me is that the author assumes giving too much to children makes them selfish, but then he immediately switches to giving to other people.  This is a widely held opinion:  you give material things to your children, or you tell them to focus on others instead.  The other option is to pay attention to your children, which he does discuss.  For example, taking the time to have real, in-depth conversations.  For example, asking them if they are happy with that ballet class or being on that soccer team; how they get along with their friends, and what school is like?   The kinds of questions that would often get a one or two-word answer out of kids.  Spending relaxed time with your children, not pressuring them to help someone else or think about what *you* want them to, just hanging out and having enough patience to hear what they want to say, when they are ready to say it.  Finally, I found his suggestions for helping others relatively superficial and even, in cases, patronizing.  OK, feed the homeless for a day.  Admirable for the helpers, but that really doesn't help much.  Bake brownies for someone.  That will make you feel good, but giving them to a "shut-in" won't help explain why the person is a "shut-in" at all, or what can be done (if anything) to improve the situation.  But of all his suggestions, I especially disliked his idea of going to a "mental hospital" and singing Christmas carols.  I have spent a fair amount of time in psychiatric hospitals myself; few people in there are in a mood to be suitably grateful to a bunch of strangers singing about Christmas.    Full disclosure:  I was in a psychiatric hospital for about 2 weeks as an inpatient just prior to Christmas 2001.  First, not everyone is Christian, and Jews and others who do not celebrate Christmas are a captive audience if they are in the hospital.  Assuming the staff would permit such a thing, which I hope they would not.  Second, and this is common sense, people in a psychiatric hospital are doing pretty poorly, emotionally, and are not likely to cheer up when someone tells them they are supposed to be happy, because it's Christmas.    Many patients have a lot of negative feelings about Christmas to begin with, for various reasons but including the fact that severe depression or other mental illness can make Christmas very unpleasant, especially when problems go untreated over a period of years.  "Normal" people singing carols can be a painful reminder that the healthy are at home, while we are in the hospital, separated from our families.  I'm not saying all patients would hate it:  how do I know?  Maybe some would love it.  But, I have experienced and read enough about the "holiday blues," which can become really serious, to know that singing to people in hospitals is not the panacea he portrays it as being.  Then there's the whole "hundred-dollar" aspect; being completely arbitrary, that guideline didn't do anything for me.  Finally, there is a crucial question he leaves out:  the risk for social embarrassment and in extreme cases, social rejection of children who do not receive presents commensurate with their friends.  Many children are surrounded by peers whose parents will probably never adopt this approach.  How to prevent malicious teasing is a serious question that is not considered here.  But it is useful for those wanting a simple, quick read that reinforces the spiritual value of Christmas.  I think his heart is in the right place.  He is a compassionate person and he is raising his children to be compassionate also.  He sees the emptiness of excessive materialism.  I find that the author revealed himself to be a truly good person, but didn't present the most thought-through strategy.  As a starting point to inspire others, though, it's great 
 I was disappointed to read this book. Nye basically argues that the world has become very complex due to the global information age and that even though the US will remain as the world superpower in the coming decades, it is in its best interest to pursue multilateralism instead of unilateralism (altough he recognizes that "at times we will have to go it alone").   It's really hard to argue with Nye's argument, because on paper it sounds very true. Unfortunately, this book does not address the practical matters of foreign policy in the first decade of the XXI century.   I bought this book expecting to find a practical, matter-of-factly counterpoint to the one spoused by the neoconservatives. I had previously read "Of Paradise and Power" (R.Kagan) and "The Threatening Storm" (K.Pollack). I wanted a counter-argument but I did not find it. I am still looking 
 The glasses are well made but I found them awkward to use. They didn't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on. The gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well for me. Every head is different, so maybe they'll work better for you 
 There's no need to be wordy.  1. Biochemistry is a natural science 2. Natural science is defined as the "the rational study of the universe via rules or laws of natural order" 3.

If B, we are no longer in the realm of science  Even if Behe or proponent of ID feel Darwinian evolution to be inadequate, for an alternative proposal to be called scientific, it must be "based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning".   This is basic scientic method. I learned it in middle school. Behe perhaps needs to be retaught.  Source: wikipedia  [... 
 You Slay Me, Katie MacAlister's first novel in the Aisling Grey series takes off in the beautiful city of Paris, France. Aisling Grey's task is simple. All she has to do is deliver an ancient dragon statue to the woman that just purchased the statue. But when Aisling reaches the buyer's home, she finds the woman dead, killed in what looks like a ritualistic killing. Considering fleeing the scene, Aisling runs into the mysterious and handsome Drake Vireo, who claims he works for Interpol. But before Aisling can gather any information from Drake, he disappears and the police arrive. The police don't know of any Drake Vireo with Interpol and are very suspicious of Aisling. To make matters worse, Drake stole the statue that Aisling was supposed to deliver to the deceased woman. Aisling is now a suspect and cannot clear her name or return home to her angry uncle without that statue. She'll have to piece together the puzzle in order to clear her name and save the day.  This series was repeatedly recommended to me by Amazon based on my reviews and purchasing history. I kept resisting because it was classified as a "Romance" novel, and frankly, I don't do "romance" novels. So when I saw that this book was apart of Amazon's Buy 3 Get the 4th Free deal, I decided to make this my "free" book. Thankfully, I paid nothing for this novel. I was horribly disappointed. It is in fact a straight up paranormal romance, though descriptions of this novel can be very misleading. The writing was terrible. The dialog was corny and just one cliche after another. The plot was really poorly put together. Basically, the novel was just a mess.  I would not recommend this book to anyone and I will not be reading any other novels in this series 
 Doomsayers are nothing new.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Jewish populations were growing rapidly in many parts of Europe, anti-semitic politicians and demagogues leaped to the fore and claimed that Jews were a fundamental threat to society.  Jews stole jobs, polluted and corrupted society, destroyed culture, and were responsible for crime.    I see a similar fear now re-occuring, except now it is for Muslims.  Muslims, as a fairly conspicuous minority, make easy targets for Europeans to blame their complex problems.  However, while Europe does face some real difficulties in economic, demographic and social terms (including with integrating minorities), the notion of a collapse of Europe into something like Afghanistan or Iran or Pakistan or Saudi Arabia is nonsense.  While Islamic radicalism and terrorism are real and dangerous threats (as the recent MI5 report indicates), terrorists and terrorist threats come from only a small fraction of the Muslim population.  Problems with economic integration stem not just from religion but also from issues related to racial discrimination as well as things like inflexible labour laws, which the French have refused to reform.  When it comes to problems like demographic decline, or economic stagnation, the Europeans have only themselves to blame, and need to adopt a more entrepenurial spirit.  They also need to recognise the need to allow people to openly practice religious faith, lest dangerous pseudo-ideaologies fill the void.    However Muslims only form around 10% of the population in France and 5% of less in the UK.  The fear of being 'bred out' is an illusion, and in any case many non-Muslim migrants are arriving in Europe each year from places like Romania and Poland.  Will the UK become Polish and Romanian in two or three decades?  Free borders are important in a globalised world, and history has generally shown isolationism and protectionism do not work to build rule of law, democracy, and prosperity.    Demonising Muslims and other minorities is a dangerous way of trying to get out of dealing with complex issues, which Europe has to do if it wants to compete with India and China and the US.  Muslims need to be seen as assets rather than threats to society, and while Muslim community leaders have an obligation to stamp out terrorism and radicalism and ensure proper integration, Europeans have an obligation not to repeat the ugly past in their treatment of minorities

  Hodgson(H)bases his entire argument on a version of the Antinomian fallacy(see D H Fischer's Historian's Fallacies,1970,Harper and Row,pp.94-97).This fallacy infects all of H's work on the interface between macroeconomics and institutions.Briefly,the antinomian fallacy argues that all events in history are unique.All inductive generalizations are false.It is impossible to learn from experience.Thus,no general theories are possible in the social sciences or liberal arts since institutions are constantly evolving over time during each specific historical period.H's version of the antinomian fallacy is that all periods of history are unique(specific).Period replaces event.This type of fallacious argument is endemic among "Cambridge Keynesians"(Joan Robinson,G L S Shackle,Tony Lawson,Geoffrey Hodgson,Victoria Chick,etc.)and American Post Keynesians(P. Davidson,D.Vickers,etc.).H incorrectly claims that Keynes's correct analysis showing that,due to technological change,advance and innovation over time,the study of the determinates of fixed investment in long lived ,physical ,durable capital goods is not homogeneous over time means that"...Keynes is inconsistent since this implies that economic theory must be related to historically specific material."(Hodgson,p.223)This simply does not follow,which explains why Keynes correctly ignored the historicists and institutionalists when it came time to write his General Theory in 1936.This is because the problem of investing in costly, fixed ,industry specific capital(factories,plant and equipment,etc.),which is irreversible and irrevocable once it is in place,has been a major decision problem since the dawn of history.The threat of technological obsolescence to the presently existing stock of capital by future innovations has occurred in the past and present and will occur in the future.Of course,there will be similarities and dissimilarities in different periods of history.Keynes has a general theory that explains why the private capital stock in every period of history will be suboptimal.It is suboptimal because investment is suboptimal in the private sector due to the uncertainty,ambiguity(D. Ellsberg's term)or lack of evidential weight(Keynes's term)of a sufficient amount of information upon which to plan such projects over a multiperiod future.This insufficiency then leads to involuntary unemployment.Of course,all this is far beyond the intellectual grasp of H.A similar conclusion applies to V.Chick,who H approvingly cites:"Chick's argument underlines the fact that the General Theory was not,in truth,a general theory(since) it applied to a historically specific set of capitalistic institutions".(p.224).Chick's fallacious statement is a very good example of the antinomian fallacy  
 This is worse than Kumbya over and over and over again. 
 Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself "buy another one because maybe this one was defective." I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well.   Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back. 
 The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's.  Her characters are hardly believable:  Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones.  Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function?  Very disappointing 
 Derek Bok in his latest book, Our Underachieving Colleges, paints a picture of colleges that is equivocal as to their progression or regression in respect of their academic performance. He see's much room for improvement and it is probably in this sense that the title mentions, "Underachieving." Of all the concepts he discusses none gets more ink than that of "critical thinking." And he gives it enough description to convince me that he does not understand it anymore than the professors in education schools do. He finds that "formal logic" and "advanced calculus" do not qualify as examples of critical thinking- and he couldn't be more wrong. Logic and mathematics are the most important types of critical thinking that have been tested over time. These are the indispensible tools of scientists and if scientists are not the most knowledgable practitioners of critical thinking, then who is? (I speak as a former scientist.)  Later in his book he tangentially acknowledges that colleges have deteriorated in certain respects, as in "grade inflation." He presents very little quantitative information- data- showing that our colleges are underachieving. There is no mention of the Graduate Record Examinations that one would think would be a good measure of undergraduate student performance and a yard stick by which comparisons could be made temporally and between colleges.  In researching his book he could have surveyed the research of the U.S. Department of Education wherein there are statistics suggestive of not only underachieving colleges but of their degradation over time. For example, the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy suggests that college graduates today only perform about as well as college juniors of ten years earlier.  The book has too much politically correct terminology and lacks the kind of critical thinking that a scientist would recognize. But "fuzzy logic" is perhaps a better descriptor of the arguments presented in the book.  I'm not sure in what circumstance I would recommend this book to others 
 What does it mean when someone gets excessively-defensive? It doesn't express that they have peace or comfort with themselves.  Writing sludge like this just fuels the fire - that I suppose they are trying to put out. If .. there .. WAS .. ever .. a .. fire. 
 one of the discs is damaged--or badly made--so I cannot view it to the end.  I don't have a way to return it without losing the whole set and am not sure I will get a speedy replacement. 
  The concept of a movie based on Miami Vice is such a good one, we had high expectations that just weren't met. We could not clearly hear most of the conversation in this movie and the plot was hard to follow because of this. Ultimately I fell asleep. The cast, cars, boats and scenery were all beauties and wasted on this production. (How did Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell get sucked into this lemon? 
 The writing was very disjointed in my opinion.  I had to read and re-read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say.  It was a struggle to read. No likeable characters.  I made it to the part where it was introduced that Madeline slept with the ex-husband and current wife.  Give me a break!  I moved on immediately.  Too many good books waiting for me to waste time on this absurd tale 
 I love Abbott & Costello movies but I was really dissapointed when I saw this set because it was missing the rest of the movies they did. I mean I can understand a lot of their films were with universal but i really thought they were looking to do the volumes to cover all of their movies.   Honestly I was happy to see the keystone cops, jeckle & hyde and meet the mummy ones on the dvd but that seemed to be it for their feature films on it. The others were documentries. I fear this may be the last of the volumes which leaves out a lot of their other films. Also it does not say on the volumes "The Universal Pictures Of Abbott & Costello" It clearly states "The Franchise Collection" This means we should be seeing our 8 movies on there.   Now if it was up to me what to put out this is how vol.4 would be:    It' Ain't Hay        Lost In Harem        In Hollywood        The Noose Hangs High        Meet The Keystone Cops        Meet The Mummy        Meet Dr. Jeckle & Mr. Hyde        Meet Captain Kidd Now after that I would put out a Volume 5 that would have these on it:First their lost film : Rio Rita                               Africa Screams                                Meet Jack & The Beanstalk                               Meet Jerry Seinfeld                               World of A&B                               Meet The Monsters (Documentry)                               Dance With Me Henry And for the 8th,(Now i know this breaks the rules a bit but i think this would be a great way to rap up the complete collection of the films) The forty foot Bride of Candy Rock (Lou's Solo Picture without Bud) Because it was his last before he died.  And There you have it the collection they ought to have put out. Now I know their not gonna do it this way, but if it helps others to know what films are missing from their collections then this is a great list 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 It might have been a good book but I got tired of reading the "dis", "dat", "dem" vernacular and finally just gave the book to the local thrift shop 
 Like I said in the title, this book is NO GOOD! It has no point and I think I got dumber as I read it. Goodbye 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 I did get a nice little buzz the first two days I took this product, and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out.  You can push yourself a bit further at the gym.  The gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product.  It wasn't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it.  I had no lasting weight loss when taking it, just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later.  I'd skip it 
 Of all the books I have read and discussed, there is one book that we never should trust...when I got this book out from the library I was all geared up for a great read...therefore was greatly disappointed as I read this book.  MacDonald is unfortunately negative about all of The Beatles songs, and in particular has it in for George and Ringo's numbers. I found that he did not have a single positive comment about any of The Beatles songs - no matter who wrote them. It makes one wonder why he wrote a book on them. If you are looking for a book with a positive approach to the Beatles masterpieces, this isn't the book you should be buying. I reccommend "A Day In The Life, the Music and Artistry of The Beatles, by Mark Hertsgaard, instead of MacDonald's sloppy, single-minded musings. This book should be put to shame 
 This is undoubtedly the *worst* book I have ever read about writing or crafting a novel.   It's hard to know where to begin when listing the things that turned me off. Perhaps it was the useless 'advice' that took up the first 1/4 of the book ["Readers want interesting characters." "Every novel needs a lead character..."].  Pretty self-evident to anyone who has EVER read a novel. Sadly, Marshall doesn't spend too much of his own time writing about giving characters depth and complexity.  No, he devotes a good portion of the book to charts that dictate how many lines each character should have, on what page each character should appear, etc.  The inside of this book looked like a diet book with weight and height tables, rather than a serious guide to writing a novel.    With so many much better books on this subject available, I can not see recommending this to ANY writer, regardless of skill level.  I suggest anyone thinking about buying this book take this simple test - find a copy of the book in your local library or bookstore, and check out the "Sample Synopsis" of a novel written using Marshall's method in the book's appendix. If the novel outlined in this synopsis - with its 2-dimensional, stereotyped characters and hack plot - is the kind of thing YOU would like to learn to write, then by all means buy one of the many used copies up for grabs on Amazon.  The work you produce will be less competition for the rest of us.  
 I purchased one that never worked.  I had it replaced and it still didn't work.  I followed directions explicitly, and tried 3 different locations on the fm band that had no signal present.  Not a sound.  Didn't matter which volume control was turned up or if they were both up.  Nothing.  Therefore, I have no idea about performance 
 Anyone could have compiled this information, even a high schooler doing a report for English class.  Aside from this obvious fact, the writing is simply boring and dry.  The history provided is sketchy, and does not necessarily tell the story of how certain birds were named, simply the etymology of birds' names 
 Hugh Farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play Bridge.  His college-age daughter Karen, her friend Barbara, his lawyer son Duke, his alcoholic wife Grace, and house servant Joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit.  Everyone scrambles to safety inside Hugh's modern bomb shelter.  As the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, Hugh starts up an affair with his daughter's friend Barbara, right in the shelter.  As if Hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene will.  When the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine, clean world.  At first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves.  Somehow, Hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be free with Barbara.  Of all the Apocalypse Fiction, this book is the worst.  The protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest.  He's not even a "love to hate" person.  The dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant, and Barbara and Hugh's constant prattlings of "Darling, Dear, and Beloved" do not fit the characters.  Neither does Hugh's occasional spouting of words like "shall" and "shan't" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the "N" word.  There is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of Hugh's daughter and Barbara's friend Karen, cannibalism, castration (Hugh cared more about his "boys" than he did his real children), pedophilia, racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut.  The entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself didn't quite believe his story.  And if he doesn't believe, how can he expect the reader to?  Overall, there is no depth or flavor in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door.  I recommend avoiding this book. 
 Boney used to be the man, but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him. Anyone who thinks this CD is good should listen to his older stuff like Seduction, Trust, or Backbone. You will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential. Cmon'Boney lets get back to multi-dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of. Peace 
 There's no real prediction system here.  This book uses technical analysis to try to determine when to short stocks.  However, if you look closely you'll see that the analysis was done selectively, after the fact.  Also, there are no charts where something unexpected happened - and no stock prediction system I'm aware of is 100% accurate.  So this book doesn't have much credibility to me.    Except for the note on moving averages below, it's worthless.  Let me give you some examples picked by opening the book to hte middle:   Page 83 - says the first break of the neckline is a fakeout - do not short.  That's only obvious AFTER the fact.  Page 88 - read from left to right.  You'll see that an actual, more distinct head and shoulders formation started two peaks to the left.  Page 91, after continually discussing head and shoulders formations, neglects it here, but it's there starting in March.  There's no reason for not using it in this chart, except it wouldn't have worked.  There's more, of course.  For the most part, the recommendation is to sell short when the stock falls through its 50 day moving average on higher than normal volume.  The problem is, half the time when this happens, the volume spike happens the same time the stock makes a huge drop.  So it doesn't necessarily give you a chance to short at the top.  However, despite this drawback, it does seem to hold true a lot, which is why this book gets 2 stars instead of one.  Use your own intelligence.  Look at the charts, reading from left to right, and imagine trying to follow his charting techniques as the charts unfolded.  It will soon be obvious how often the charting was done AFTER the fact.    
 This EP is very curious in that most of the trademarks of Death Cab's sound are nowhere to be found.  I can't say that I know that Bjork song that they've covered, but in general, I don't care much for Death Cab's cover songs because they tend to play them as fans, rather than playing them as if they were Death Cab songs.  20th Century Towers is a fairly forgettable number, and while Stability is a good song, now that we have a more concise reworking available on Plans (The Stable Song), its lost a bit of its sheen.  If you love everything Death Cab has done, there's probably something for you here.  But if you're looking for an entry into what the big deal with these guys is all about, I would start with something else 
 As the previous reviewer pointed out, this is most definitely NOT an introduction to Marxian economics. Roemer was one of the most prominent of the "analytical Marxists" who supposedly attempted to reconstruct Marxism on the basis of methodological individualism. Frequently, they ended up in hilariously strained defenses of official Soviet Marxism (the tenets of which are mainly intellectually indefensible, unlike real Marxism). G.A. Cohen's book on Marx's theory of history is a good example of this. The analytical Marxists regarded classical Marxism as nonsense, because they never took the time and work necessay to understand it in systematically.  After a misguided criticism of classical Marxism, Roemer spends a large portion on his book developing economic models which as far as I can tell, are irrelevant. He shows that if people with unequal amounts of wealth engage in production and distribution  engage in exchange, patterns of inequality are maintained and accumulation may magnify them. This unsurprising result also holds if there are only credit markets, only labor markets, etc...Couldn't he have explained all of this in 2 or 3 pages?    The one redeeming feature of this book is the discussion of theories of justice and desert. Romer utterly demolishes those who defend the distribution of wealth under capitalism (Even a potentially more egalitarian capitalism) on the basis of desert.  There is a chapter on historical materialism. It is just a defense of Cohen's awful book.  If you really want to read analytical Marxists on economics, see Roemer's "Analytical Foundations of Marxian Economic Theory." At least it derives some interesting welfare properties of capitalist economies 
 Hmmmm, a female published author who hates feminism. Ms. Hoff-Sommers, if it wasn't for feminism, you would be BEATEN for having written a book, BEATEN for knowing how to read and write, and BEATEN for having an education. Next time youwant to write a book, thank your sisters who DIED so you can write a book trashing all the things they did you you 
 Who would Jesus bomb?  Who shall we bomb next in the name of Jesus 
 I think Wienberg must be spamming these reviews with a multitude of user names.  That is the only explanation that can explain the four star average rating for this steaming pile of refuse.  This is a book from an era when there must have been very low standards for 'popular' technical books.  Weinberg is no psychologist, his observations are amateurish and ill informed.  This book reads more like a 'best practices' work for the mainframe era.  The most telling thing I can relate is my experience; after finishing a chapter I would read the chapter summary and not recognize a single thing from the chapter I had just read.  The most laughable part was the coverage of programming languages.  Wienberg is so completely ignorant of programming language research, even for that era, it's stunning.  AND the man had (has) the gall to write on the subject as if he knows something.  The most distasteful part of the book are the Anniversary Edition comments.  They basically consist of Weinberg telling us that, he may not have been completely correct, but wasn't he amazingly prescient for the times?  Gag.  I'll never read another book by this author 
 Pojman teaches at the Military Academy at West Point, and is a known proponet of the death penalty; that's not why Om giving him a bad review.  This might not even distress you, but getting ethics from west point seems to me like getting Gay and Lesbian studies from Brigham Young.    Authors like Nieziche, John Stuart Mill, and Ayn Rand will start off a chapter, only to be immediately refuted by someone like Phillip Hallie or Jean Bethke Elshtain who make anyone remotely relativist, egoist, utilitarian seem like some sort of heartless monster.  These obscure types all seem to have failed comp.  Granted, I'm no fan of Niziche or Rand, but the entire voice of the volume (not to mention the several essays Pojman writes himself) seems self-referential and absolutist.  Pojman claims that "parents would abandon or abuse their children and spouses abandon each other whenever it was convenient...commitment, loyalty, fidelity all...are moral notions." (39); animals have no morality, and, yet, they protect their offspring.   Pojman seems to believe that on our own, we humans will not only sink down to the level of animals, but below the level of animals; not even Hobbes will believe that.  The first work of literature is Lord of the Flies, and it seems to set the tone for the entire chapter.  Literature like Sophie's choice and a narrow sliver from The Brother's Karamozov seems to lean toward the sensationalist rather than the insightful, while the philosophical essays, as always, reduce human nature down to its most absurd situations.  This volume is edited in such a way, that it presents an untrusting view of humanity, and an even less trusting view of society.  In my opinion, there's too much urgency and not enough scholarship for this book to serve me well.  My ethics professor says he thinks Pojman makes a good foil; at 68 bucks, that's one expensive foil 
 I have been using the ecopads sold on Amazon for a couple of months.  Once I got the hang of it (espresso grind coffee packed firmly, but not overpacked), I discovered that I could enjoy my favorite coffee in the Senseo machine.  BEWARE --QUICKCUP pods DO NOT WORK RIGHT.  They are about 1/32 of an inch smaller than the ecopads and that's the difference.  The water must slip around the edge because using quickcup results in a watery brew.  I'm quite skilled at loading the ecopads, so I tried the quickcups 3 times to be sure.  I repeat, THEY DON'T WORK RIGHT.  There's a reason the ecopads are twice as expensive - they work 
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 Could he take any longer to make a point?  He's at the top of his field, but he needs to be more concise.  It's not like he's telling us complex stuff that needs repeating 
 Extremely disappointing. Bought the toy for my son for Christmas. It didn't come with the battery ($30 extra) and the battery is still sold out everywhere, including online, almost a month later.   Don't bother. There are lots of other great RC toys out there 
 I'm a huge Dylan fan---own everything he ever released.  In my humble opinion, this is Bob's worst.  Just a really bad CD.  'Nuff said 
 The beginning was quite promising but this excitement soon fizzled out as it moved beyond. By the middle of the book, I was just reading through aimlessly. (I do have a compulsion of having to finish every book I start reading, no matter how good or bad)  By the end, I was thoroughly let down. And oh, the twist at the end was surprising but it could not rescue this wreck 
 First I would like to say that when I purchased this item it was advertised as the "Hobby" addition.  When I received it I didn't think it was the hobby set so I called amazon, the operator said she did not know about this product and provided me with the phone number to who sold it to me.  I called that number 3 times and left a message each time to please call me and I have yet to receive a phone call back.. When I gave this item to my husband for Christmas he confirmed my thought that it was not the "Hobby" addition.  I was not only upset that I did not get what I was looking for but that no one had returned my call 
 As already stated Disney did not say that these were not new and we were very disappointed to discover they were ones we had already seen. Very misleading advertising 
 This is  the wrong message based on theory and speculations. Facts are confusing and not backed up by good controlled data.    Ther are numerous less well publicized but more scientific books available on this subject    see hypertensionfoundation.org for simple accurate informatio 
 Expecting sexy camp in the tradition of "Beyond Valley of the Dolls" I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Instead I struggled through this tedious, repetitive, and confusing mess of a film. I respect what the director was trying to create, but the end product is nearly unwatchable. It's starts out so well too.... "I tried not to remember why I buried my trumpet." ...but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story that isn't the least bit sexy or interesting. I know this film has a sizeable cult following. It is pretty to look at (sometimes when it isn't in grainy slow-motion) but I just couldn't make it through. Maybe it's worth a look, but I personally wish I had rented it 
 Although this set does introduce some basic aspects of chemistry, the contents are not "high quality" at all.  The microscope is inadequate for even seeing salt crystals and the magnifier is cloudy and has bubbles in it.  Don't waste your money.  
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 If you are a Christian and believe in the Bible, then you need to stay away from this book. As the old adage goes, "You can't judge a book by its cover".  The author purports to answer various questions from kids using the "voice of God". However, the "answers" that he gives are not Bible-based and go against the very infallible word of God. For instance (and I paraphrase), when a girl asks the question "Why am I a lesbian?" His answer is that she was born that way because of genetics (just as you were born right-handed, with blue eyes, etc.). Then he tells her to go out and "celebrate" her differences.   Another girls poses the question "I am living with my boyfriend. My parents say that I should marry him because I am living in sin. Should I marry him?"  His reply is, "Who are you sinning against? Not me, because you have done nothing wrong."   Another question asks about God's forgiveness of sin. His reply "I do not forgive anyone because there is nothing to forgive. There is no such thing as right or wrong and that is what I have been trying to tell everyone, do not judge people. People have chosen to judge one another and this is wrong, because the rule is "'judge not lest ye be judged.'"   And the list goes on. Not only are these books the false doctrine, but in some instances, it even quotes the Word of God in error. 
 I bought this as a birthday present for my mom because she used to have the It's A wonderful Life in color on VHS.I recored over this VHS about 5 years ago, and i have felt terrible ever since. AMazon said that this edition was in color, so i decided that this was a perfect gift for my mom. I received the DVD today, and i am so dissapointed that it is not color? Why did they tell us it wasn't 
 I wanted a humidifier that was silent, but when I plugged this in, not only could I hear it from the other room, but it's a high-pitched whine. I don't know what to do about it. I think I'll probably just return it for something different 
 Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band. I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it 
 You don't need to be a student or to own your home to get the Home and Student version. Any one can get that version. Microsoft doesn't enforce the student part and by home, they mean where you live 
 This book seemed to focus a lot on how beneficial it would be to order the course(s)by the author(s). It was ok 
 By far nothing comparable to Javier Solis. Not taking anything away from the tenor of OPERA not Ranchera...Lets leave the rancheras for those who are gifted in its style.  You want real rancheras listen to MR. Javier Solis 
 The teory written by Mr. Maxwell Maltz sounds very interesting: if you can control your mind the you can do anything you want with your life. Wow, what a book!  The question you never asqued yourself:  What if instead of working so hard everyday on changing   "myself" and " my life" through the mind, what happens if we throw away all that stressing stuff and simply starting to live. That is the treasure of the no-mind. The treasure of your heart.   If you are one of the people who think this is an incredible book, i bet you think all the time in your so called "life" and believe that you will someday be a great person with a lot of possesions, money and relationships. Please be careful, Once you become aware of the mind as an ilusion, you see all these bunch of desires as simple ilusions, that have to fed day to day for the rest of your life with no final retribution, this is why this is called the meditation of suffering, the meditation for what you dont have, the meditation for what never will fulfill you. I invite you to stop seeking through your mind and begin too see how wonderful life is, When there is no more "me" to feed with the mind its false illusions, then you will discover true freedom, and a bliss you never could imagine, the joy of being.  Instead of this book i recomend you "A diamond in your pocket" by Gangaji or "A New Earth: Awakening to your life purpose" by Eckhart Tolle, these books will help you to Awaken from your mind and find out who is the real You, the one that has been covered with false illusions and thoughts since a long time, the one that's ready to be discovered 
 This hummingbird feeder looked like a good idea until I filled it (following the direction) and put it up on the window and it fell off 15 seconds later and the glass busted 
 Author is really good but the way SIP described in the book is a kind of child-story , details on important parts of SIP and on unified services are skipped instead make-up parts are highlighted 
 The American DVD was censored, the way they censored Wild on E!. Maybe the american moral is different from all others. How would americans censored a theatrical representation of La Celestina? Have they not see La Cestina in a Theater? Buy the Spain DVD PAL version. It is not censored, as it should be. It is a completely different experience. 
 I was stunned by how bad this CD sounds.  I'm no expert, so I can't give you a precise description with proper terminology.  Suffice it to say it's a bad job of transferring the recordings to CD.  I later bought the Gold version, and the difference is like night and day.  Judy Collin's voice is too wonderful to let this awful CD prevent you from really hearing her.  The Gold version is worth the extra money 
 It worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time, he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his Cheerios everywhere.  I tried it a few more times after that and got same result.  The lid is WAY too easy to remove.  
 First, I did not rate this poorly by comparing it to the original. I looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake.  Also, unlike many reviewers, I had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back. The majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back. American culture and freedom is not the historical norm.  That said, I was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie, nor the quality of the acting, though the special effects were pretty good, IMHO. The theme, however, that struck me as most rememorable in this movie, and caused me to drop an otherwise 3 to a 1 (or less), is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away. As our "hero" encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world (forgive my not remembering their names), it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for, even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down. Then there's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion, yet the moment he enters the spaceship, he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that. I couldn't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience, "Hey, haven't you heard of that guy Darwin? Yeah? Then why do you still believe in that silly God person of yours?"  This movie, I believe did try to touch an issue of the day, secularism verus religion. The movie, it seems, coming down heavily on the side of secularism 
 I was expecting something more like a SUNSET magazine type presentation...this book is not a "how to" manual on building an oven.  In fact, the directions given were so poorly presented that it felt like I needed to hire these guys to do the job.  Outlines, guidelines, drawings or anything else one would expect for buildiing a brick oven were completely lacking.  The bread portion of the book is well...okay, but it has been better written and done elsewhere.  I would pass on this book and keep lookin 
 I slogged my way through Chapter 4, got through Chapter 5 out of sheer curiousity, and then threw the book (trash) in the trash. 
    A word of advice: run, don't walk, run from this crap. It's a sales brochure for his simplistic trading system.    Briefly, by his own admission, the author is a failed forex trader, then almost bankrupted himself riding CISCO from 90 to 20, joined Marines, and is currently peddling a simplistic trading system to make a living. If these are results you would like to duplicate, go ahead and buy the book.     The only reason I even bothered to write this review is because I am disgusted at the fact McGraw-Hill stooped low enough to publish it. As another reviewer points out, the fact that Dick's data provider owns McGraw-Hill may have something to do with it.         
 We had a copy of this book and took it with us to the Strawberry Lodge last week. What a mistake. Just go ahead and write 'sucker' on your forehead and get it over with. First off, the author has changed information about the climbs, not to mention re-named some. This made the long-time locals of the area really mad and we found out how much. We had the book at the Lodges' bar, and did we hear about the author and his dubious ways of earning a living. After hanging out in the area for a few days, we got all of the beta we needed about the local routes. I would not recommend this book to anybody. The only people who do, are friends of the author, so I don't expect unbias opinions from them 
 First off, Starship Troopers is one of my top ten books period.  Well done Mister Heinlein.  This book?  In a word--UGH!   The dialogue is laughable at times, noxious at others, and sometimes entertaining enough to keep you reading to see what comes next.  Sometimes what comes next is plausible and exciting and entertaining.  Sometimes it is none of those.  And at one point, it's jaw-droppingly shocking and nauseating:            Main male character, former military officer, is someone you learn to like a lot as you read through the book.  Until you suddenly find out he's bisexual around page 300.  And had a homosexual experience he didn't find unpleasant with a Boy Scout Leader when he was a kid.  Thanks for springing that on us just before the end.    Bottom line:  Do not recommend.  But Starship Troopers--get 2 copies...one to read, one to lend out 
 Cruver opens his book from an ethical high horse, but his own actions make me wonder who he is to accuse others of greed. He has shown he can take the low road himself, by:  -- scheming to continue getting paychecks even though he was no longer earning them; -- taking advantage of delays in shutting down the program to provide employees with free computer; -- attempting to take out of the company the program he and his team developed; -- spending his job-hunting time burning "free" CDs of downloaded music. (By the way, Brian, if you are listening in, I read a library copy of your book, so you have a reader for which you have received no incremental royalty.)  The unfortunate thing is that, to many of us, there is nothing wrong with taking advantage of an out-of-control benefits programs and downloading CDs instead of buying them. The differences are subtle, perhaps. But you should not steal from your employer, even if your employer has been underhanded. Under oath, before Congress, most Enron executives took the Fifth, implying that that they had done wrong and knew it. It seems to me that Cruver has done wrong and may not know it, which is even more tragic.  Ethics? I think Cruver has a lot to learn. Greed? He knows a bit about that, as a victim and as a perpetrator. 
 I agree, the book has many, many good insights and most of it makes sense. You can theoretically use his techniques, but sometimes they are just unrealistic in real-life situations. Also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth, more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips. Sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited. I would not buy this again...it's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life--not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee. It seriously lacks depth but it's a decent read...but you will forget everything you read in 2 days.   I'm sure there are lengthier and more in depth books that deal with the same topic which are more worth your money, time and effort. 
 This book by Ramon Jimenez is limited to Caesar and his campaigns in Gaul which he led under an extraordinary command lasting from 58 B.C. to 50 B.C.  Although the book may at first appear to be informative about Roman history and Caesar, it contains too many serious errors and missassumptions to be anything more than a crude guide to military facts that Caesar himself more adequately and eloquently describes to the average reader already!  Ramon Jimenez has absolutely no credentials in classical studies, history, or anthropology of any sort. His background is solely as a civil servant in California. Mr. Jimenez didn't even begin to undertake any studies in antiquity until recently in which his inquiries amounted to nothing more than his personal pursuit of a non-chalant hobby.  He has neither a Master's or Ph.D. in anything remotedly related to anthropology, archeology, or classical studies.  There's also no indication that Mr. Jimenez has any background in Ancient Greek or Latin which would be prerequisites to presenting one's self as any sort of established authority in the field of classical studies.  Even disregarding his lack of academic qualifications to present any thesis, dissertation, or even lecture on Roman history, his poor knowledge as to the Late Roman Republic is made plainly obvious by his cursory summaries of Roman society and politics that are nothing but misleading oversimplifications at best. Mr. Jimenez' obvious lack of knowledge results in his work focusing on Julius Caesar far too narrowly giving the reader overly general, if not misleading, information as to the society, culture, and political environment Julius Caesar lived in.  Mr. Jimenez' study is essentially in a complete void of in terms of historical context and much of the information he does provide is misleading at best. One cannot understand Julius Caesar without knowing much about the Roman Republic and its agents any more than one could understand Alexander The Great without knowing any significant details about Ancient Greece, Macedonia, and Persia. This book is therefore fundamentally unreliable as an authority on the Roman Republic or even Caesar specifically.  A perfect example of Mr. Jimenez' poor scholarship is his explanation of human sacrifice in antiquity that he makes on page 38,  4. He recites multiple examples of ritualistic killings in Celtic culture (that are verifiable based on literary and archeological evidence) and then suggests that even Rome itself was equally barbaric in that it didn't ban human sacrifice until the 1st century B.C.: suggesting the conclusion that Rome either previously tolerated such acts or passed such a ban to prevent Romans from performing human sacrifice.  It is obvious here that Mr. Jimenez is ignorant as to the context of this ban because it had nothing to do with preventing human sacrifice by Romans nor was it an indication that Romans previously tolerated human sacrifice. The sources Mr. Jimenez relied on to make this argument could only be derived from the histories of Pliny and Plutarch as to a law that was proposed by Publius Crassus (father of Marcus Licinius Crassus, the triumvir) while Consul and approved by the Senate at the beginning of the 1st century B.C. which he put into execution as governor of Further Spain  (Pliny, HN 30.12; Plut. Quaest Rom. 83.) If Mr. Jimenez would have done some simple research, he would have found that this law applied only to Rome's Celtic province of Spain to prevent Celts of that region (Lusitanians/Portuguese in particular) from continuing their rampant practice of human sacrifice. No law was passed before that time because Rome had not yet come into extended contacts with Celtic tribes that extensively practiced human sacrifice (not all Celts practiced human sacrifice.)  Even worse is that Mr. Jimenez fails to recognize that Caesar himself in his Commentaries remarked with some perplexity and disgust as to Gallic druids stuffing victims into a wickerman to burn them alive. Mr. Jimenez then compounds his ignorance by stating, "[T]he heads of defeated enemies [were still]...presented to the Emperor Trajan as late as the second century [A.D.]" id.  Severed heads of executed tribal chieftains and their retinues after a battle don't meet the parameters of a ritualistic killing which involves clear religious ceremonies or institutions that seek to appease gods or natural forces with human victims (e.g. the Celts, Aztecs or other Meso-American civilizations.)  Roman legionaires bringing severed heads of enemies to the emperor isn't human sacrifice, it's simply an exemplary execution and the head is brought as proof of victory to the emperor or displayed to other enemies as a deterrent.  Such acts were purely political and military in purpose and had no religious significance: they simply entailed the army showing its victory and allegiance to the emperor or it carrying out a brutal but effective diplomacy in the name of Rome.  Although there are perhaps one or two identifiable incidents of actual ritualistic killings to appease the gods in the Early Roman Republic up to the Third Punic War (a span of several centuries!), they were anomalies that were not universally accepted by Roman contemporaries and that occurred in extremely desperate situations. By the time of the Late Republic, all Romans clearly considered the practice of human sacrifice as barbaric in the true sense of the word (i.e. foreign and uncivilized.) What is amusing is that, after citing all of the wrong examples as evidence of ritualistic killings in Rome, Mr. Jimenez fails to address the universally known Roman institution of gladiatorial spectacles that obviously came the closest to human sacrifice: even that however is somewhat debatable as it is a more distinctive category of blood sports which are primarily secular but have quasi-religious overtones as well but I digress and will leave it at that. In sum, as in other parts of his work, Mr. Jimenez here took pieces of information on Roman society out of context because he is plainly ignorant of the context in the first place and, therefore, not qualified to render a scholarly opinion on the subject.     Mr. Jimenez' poor understanding of Roman society and political structures is also evident when he states that freedmen couldn't vote (page 13,  3) which is unequivocally false. Unlike other civilizations of the time, Rome had very liberal policies regarding manumission and historical evidence is simply overwhelming in showing that freedmen (libertini) were given political suffrage as they were allocated among the four urban voting blocks (tribes) out of the total 35 voting blocks. The only political difference between freedmen and commoners(plebeians)was that they couldn't hold political offices or official priesthoods. How Mr. Jimenez could have come to an opposite conclusion is simply beyond my comprehension because not even a beginning student of Roman history would make such a blatant mistake.  Mr. Jimenez also makes errors as to the types of foods that existed at the time as well as the alimentary regiment for Roman legions.  He claims that the common food for Roman legions was lentils and beans on page 128,  2. Beans are typically understood as the New World crop variety that didn't come to Europe until more than 1500 years after Julius Caesar. Contrary to Mr. Jimenez' claim, the common diet for the Roman soldier consisted of lentils and corn (generally all edible cereals except for maize which also came from the Americas), not beans. If "beans" were at all included in the military diet, they were restricted to field/string beans: something which Mr. Jimenez fails to specify.  Lentils and corn were the staple rations of the Roman legions because they were highly nutritious, light to carry, and not as perishable as other foods such as string or field beans.  In these two examples, Mr. Jimenez again demonstrates his ignorance of the underlying culture, institutions, and history of ancient Rome to the detriment of the uninformed reader and historical truth.  These types of incomplete summaries and false facts are rampant throughout the book and clearly indicate the author's lack of knowledge as to his subject. Mr. Jimenez' poor research is indicative of a tunnel-vision approach to only a very limited segment of Roman history that is inevitably dependent on a thourough and broad understanding of the Roman Republic specifically and antiquity in general: an understanding that Mr. Jimenez clearly lacks and results in his painfully evident demonstration of poor scholarship. I have no credentials in classical studies either and even I can see the gross inaccuracies in this work. The difference with me is that I wouldn't be so arrogant as to publish a book claiming to be authoritative when it's based only on loose knowledge I obtained on my spare time as a hobbyist. This book should be shunned as an authoritative text as to anything dealing with Rome: the only thing it's clearly authoritative on is its author's ignorance of the subject matter. Indeed, this book does a gross disservice to all true scholars who have committed years of schooling and dilligent work to the study of antiquity to dispel the very same misconceptions Mr. Jimenez ignorantly propagates as sound research in this poor work.  Ignore this pitiful text and read Caesar's Commentaries directly or the work of qualified scholars of classics such as Gruen, Syme, Millar, or others who clearly know what they're writing about before they publish their work 
 I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that 
 it's surprising that so many people gave this book a favorable rating - did we read the same book? i found "purple hibiscus" a little to simplistic and childish for any accolades - there was no particular insight on any of the issues e.g. physical abuse, first love, teenage angst/rebellion - to speak of, and the political ranting towards the end is laughable. apparently, everyone that can write a few words is now styling themselves as political activists, i wonder where ms. adichie was during those tumultous times - enjoying the breeze well away from the conflict in london - and now she's spewing out all the stuff she probably heard from her parents. i doubt that any self-respecting nigerian - unless you're the type that thinks "mills and boons" are literary masterpieces - will find anything remarkable about this book. as for people who don't know anything about nigeria, or africa, i suggest you read chinua achebe, buchi emecheta, or wole soyinka (for the cerebral) to get a real flavor 
 First off, there IS some good information in here for a new designer. If you are not still in school, however, don't bother with this thing.  First off, I found the book to be outdated. For example, the author references "control panels" and the "chooser". Yep, that's right OS9! Additionally, he tells where to find certain commands within Photoshop CS, but then he gives lengthy explanations of where to also find the same commands within Photoshop 5! What?! Photoshop 5!?  One nit-picky problem I have with this book is author's use of the word "calibration" instead of "color-correction". I have NEVER heard any designer say they need to "calibrate" an image. Calibration has very specific association within the graphic-design world and that is with color-output and -input devices. I was utterly confused at chapter 9's title, "Calibrating color images". I understand that "calibrate" is gramatically correct but "color-correction" is the accepted nomenclature. (props to The Dude)  Next, the chapter about Photoshop's Color Managament system is only 8 pages long. The author basically states that Photoshop's defaults are fine and not to mess with CMS. I find this contradictary to my own expererience. A color ad CANNOT be converted to CMYK with the default settings and that same file sent to both a glossy magazine and newspaper. Good luck getting that ad to look good in newsprint! That's what this guys is proposing though. Ugh.  To be fair, his history of the printing process and basic color-correction techniques sections ARE pretty good. I cannot say i didn't pick-up a tip or two along the way. but the bad outweighted the good for me. I was really looking for something more advanced but this wasn't it 
 The author, H.D.M. Spence, criticizes King David for something that the Bible NEVER criticized him for, polygamy. The Bible says in 1 Kings 15:5 that  "David did [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any [thing] that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite."  The author disagrees with the Bible when he writes,  "David's public and private career was necessarily the better for the presence in his home of such a woman, {Abigail} though the elevating influence of her character was impaired by his adoption of polygamy. Many are the counteracting influences under which the best of men develope, and Scripture, by thus calling attention to David's domestic affairs, gives us a clue to some of the circumstances amidst which his virtues and failings appeared."  Again he writes:  "Yet it is open to us to note how, at a time when polygamy was "winked at," and no sin was necessarily to lie on this account at the door of David, yet by this very thing he was undermining the peace and unity of his own family."  This is double speak. On the one hand Spence says that "no sin was necessarily to lie on this account at the door of David" and on the other he says that David was "undermining the peace and unity of his own family" and that David "impaired Abigail's "elevating influence." To this I ask, Does Spence think that Abigail was so base as to let her husband David's marriage to additional wives keep her from maintaining a right relationship with her husband and with the Lord? In the accusation against David there is likewise an accusation against Abigail. Neither can defend themselves here but I would say that the Psalms are quite a defense in themselves against attacks by those who prostrate themselves at the golden calf of monogamy. It is clear in the Psalms that David understood more about a right relationship with the Lord than any of us.  Sin is what the Bible calls sin and the Bible never calls polygamy a sin. The nation of Israel came from four wives of the same man. I suppose that Jacob sinned by carrying out the Lord's plan to bless him? To believe such a thing borders on anti-semitism. By focusing on polygamy and claiming that it was the cause of so many a biblical character's downfall our eyes are turned away from our own sinful nature as a reason for failure. We are become like the man who stood in front of the temple and prayed "God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican." Christians should pray like the publican whom Jesus praised, "God be merciful to me a sinner."  If you like cultural pap disguised as theology then you will like what Spence has written. If you prefer the truth then find a good Bible and you'll learn that neither Christian monogamy nor Christian polygamy are taught but simply Christian marriage which includes the right of a man to have more than one such marriage at the same time 
 I read this because someone recommended Janet Evonovich's books as being good reads - pretty hilarious- etc.  I had also seen a couple of her books on the best seller list.  I could not get into them at all.  They are very simple with character development that doesn't really occur.  When I read I am usually able to picture a character in my mind - not so with these books.To me, the recommend was highly over rated.  If you want to read something simple, fast and easy on an airplane to kill time - maybe - otherwise skip Evonovich 
 I am so sorry that I bought this book.  It is unfortunate that you do not have a Penguin or Everyman's Library edition.  First of all the book is too large to read in bed.  Secondly, whoever did the proofreading should be fired.  There are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading.  If the postage were not so expensive from Israel, I would return the book to Amazon 
 This film is disappointing.  The narration is distracting and tedious.  What there is of the individual stories is interesting, but not worth suffering through endless sex education for the hopelessly ignorant.

 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 One day I decided I needed to read every type of book out there. I usually ready fantasy novels. I wanted to know if I'd be interested in other books besides fantasy. I picked up a horror novel and it was slightly entertaining. Started to read a historical fiction novel but never finished. Then I picked up this up. I read the whole thing and decided never again to read a romance novel. This guy I forget his name now but he was so pathetic and weird. He wants to marry some girl from the telephone...stupid! But what pissed me off was the ending! DUMB 
 King David gay?  Hahahahahaha!  What a joke!  Gays have made a business of co-opting historical figures for their cause--they say Lincoln was gay, Shakespeare...hell, pick someone, and odds are you'll find someone in the gay community who says he was gay--and now they're going after biblical figures.  Unbelieveable.  The relationship between David and Jonathan was not erotic, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.  What they had was a covenant friendship, similar to a blood tie.  If you want to know what the Bible really says, read reputable theologians, not these agenda-driven fringe lunatics 
 Nothing happened in the first 300 pages.  How many ways can you write that Felecia couldn't fall in love with Rory because their families were in a fued.  Likewise, Rory couldn't love Felecia because he was afraid to lose a 3rd wife.  They hardly even conversed - I couldn't understand how they developed fellings for one another.  Felicia had so much character but she never used it until the last 50 pages. The book had potential but Patricia must have been on a tight schedule.  The editing was horrible also.  Don't bother with this one. 
 I gave this only one star as I didn't actually read it. I thought I was ordering books for my grand-daughter, but it turned out to be audio tapes. I paid over $12. for it, but was only refunded $7. Extra fees were added that weren't there when I purchased.  I wrote to Amazon about not wanting a refund, but wanting the actual books, I got NO RESPONSE. I will never order from Amazon again, I am very disappointed with the way this was handled 
 LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actor Clint Eastwood has dropped a libel lawsuit over an unauthorized biography in exchange for the removal of passages from the book, including claims that the "Unforgiven" star beat his wife, attorneys for both sides said on Thursday.    Eastwood, 74, sued author Patrick McGilligan and St. Martin's Press over "Clint: The Life and Legend" in federal court in San Jose, claiming the book contained false and defamatory statements. The book was previously published in the United Kingdom by HarperCollins.The offending material included statements by a former associate who said in a tape-recorded interview that he had seen Eastwood abuse his former wife, Maggie Eastwood.The former associate later recanted the claim and McGilligan and his publisher agreed to remove the statement from future editions, the attorneys said. Other terms of the settlement were not disclosed due to a confidentiality statement, the attorneys said. - This book sucks. I have read a number of articles over the years that make Clint out to be a great guy, and a lot of them mention andy of his good qualities such as his affection for animals and kids, but this book never mentions any of that. I found that very strange.  He's quick to point out any negative feeling anyone has ever had for a particular movie and sometimes he follows it up with 'well, some people like it'. He got some of his facts wrong in Clints early years. Its kind of obvious he's never seen some of these films.  He should watch some of the movies before he reviews them.  Let's give him some of his own medicine:  Remove the "Mc" from Patrick McGilligan and you get Gilligan from Gilligan's Island! Perhaps the abuse he took as a child from such a ridiculous name warped his mind over the years. There isn't even a photograph of the author on the book jacket which suggests he's an ungly man with an ugly psyche 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 This book is a continuous barrage of opinions from Patrick Henry, whose philosophy seems to be that "nothing is certain except the fact that nothing is certain," which is intellectual relativism. The good thing about the book is its style. As a sort of journal of lessons learned in life, it would be interesting even to someone who disagrees. I would like to see more books out there that take that approach, but I hope that future authors view their work as an addition to the existing 2000 years of Christianity, rather than a modification of it 
 I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic". 
 This movie must be restored--the quality of picture is unacceptable beginning with Bloody Mary's singing Bali Hi. I tried to purchase a completely restored, digitally remastered DVD of this musical and could not find one in 2007.  I returned this DVD to the seller 
 Great series.  The last three episodes on the disc were damaged 
 My goddess is the only song worth listening to on the entire album, the rest sounds like soft, slow garbage from SR-71's File 13. Get their new one instead, which is heavier and pure rock. Half of these songs border on pop-punk, and punk SUCKS!! 
 Overall, I would say this book was pretty boring.  I like books that have more dialogue and action than description and details.  The one thing this book had plenty of was description and details.  It seemed like Lahiri gave way too much background information and didn't tell enough about the actual story as it pertained to Gogol.  I was really looking forward to reading this book because the movie preview made the movie seem pretty good.  I have a feeling this would still be a good movie, but just not a very good book.  If you don't want to be very entertained and enthused, then read this book.  Otherwise, I would choose something with more action and entertainment 
 Please be careful and make sure you can see your baby when playing with these keys.  The plastic ring holding the keys can break.  We found the small broken piece in our baby's mouth!  We received this toy only three weeks ago 
 Please check out "God Calling" instead!  There's no comparison between the two, except that "Come Away My Beloved" seems inauthentic in comparison.  "Come Away My Beloved" is one person's imagination about what God might be saying, while "God Calling" is an authentic representation of what God's saying.  Trust me on this one 
 I can say that it is a singular waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and buy a book of successful essays instea 
 For the cost of the book, I was expecting some more advanced concepts than examples such as how to set a table, get gas for your car, and get ready for work.  This is a workbook more for students learning how to create workflow diagrams.  For a working professional, it is useless.  It does not deal with complex work processes 
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it 
 I agree completely with Dr. Chorbajian.  I purchased this book in preparation for a graduate level criminal profiling class and have been thoroughly disappointed with both the quality of the writing and the depth (or lack thereof) of discussion.  The authors may be experts in their field, but you wouldn't know it from this book.  Unless you're forced to buy this book for school, opt for something else 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 I understand that Diana wrote this in 1990, and I applaud her for not wanting to update the book, since she no longer has first hand knowledge of the topic (per the introduction).  I just wish her editor was better, as I had several typos in my copy-one on the FIRST page!  At least I think it was a typo, as I don't know of anyone who wears cutoffs and a tank top in supper. The story was ok, more like the Diana I grew to love in the 1980s anmd 1990s (since the book was originally published then) 
 My first review of this book is the Customer Review dated June 6, 2000. Without retracting anything I wrote in that review or my rating of the book, I would like to supplement my first review by suggesting three "entry-points" into the book for serious-minded readers:  (1) Mr. Fogel writes on page 10 - 'Technological advances in distilling reduced the costs of spirits and made it possible for the urban poor to afford immoderate amounts of alcohol. Reductions in the cost of ocean transportation brought huge waves of immigrants into American labor markets, lowering wages and promoting urban unemployment.' (From roughly 1875 through 1914.)  Consider the perspective of a social scientist who acknowledges the massive destitution of the early twentieth century's workers and their families in America (see next paragraph), but who finds remarkable causally the cheap ocean transportation rates paid by immigrants and their immoderate alcohol consumption in America; and who nowhere mentions either the industrial magnates who benefited -- not coincidentally -- from those two phenomenon, or the American labor movement which was fought most effectively for years by those magnates using those immigrants as scabs and strikebreakers. Maybe it's time to stop thinking of Robert Fogel as a historian, and consider him simply a practitioner of the world's greatest pseudo-science, economics.  (2) Mr. Fogel writes on page 177 - 'The new equity issues in the United States do not arise from the shocks of rapid urbanization, the destruction of small businesses by competition from industrial giants, the massive destitution created by the prolonged unemployment of up to one-quarter of prime-aged workers, the disappearance of the frontier as a safety valve for urban unemployment and poverty, or the undernutrition and premature death of the great majority of urban workers and their family members. Quite the contrary, the new issues are to a large extent the product of the solutions to these problems achieved by a combination of economic growth and the success of the reforms advocated by the Social Gospelers, their allies, and their successors.'  Imagine what Mr. Fogel means by the word 'solutions.' And in light of the facts described in the book American Apartheid, for example, consider which population(s) suffering "urban unemployment and poverty" Mr. Fogel thinks have had their problems solved by economic growth and the reforms advocated by the Social Gospelers, etc.  (3) Mr. Fogel writes on page 180 - '....the reform agenda spelled out by the religious Right......more fully addresses the new issues of egalitarianism than does the Agenda of the Third Great Awakening.' (The T.G.A. being the widespread reforms in America beginning at the end of the nineteenth century which led to the rise of the welfare state and policies to promote diversity.)  Imagine what Mr. Fogel means by the word 'egalitarianism. 
 A pathetically boring book. It just carries rhetorical dialogue between the two main characters & never really develops the main story well. The bickering between Kerry & Silver becomes boring drivel & is endless. The Firestorm, & how it's carried off, remains mostly a mystery hidden away. There's a devious North Korean who remains faceless and is never developed. The author tries to save it with a twist toward the end, but by that time you're so bored it's anti-climatic and I didn't care. The best thing about the book is it's cover. Bottom line? Save your money, unless you have trouble sleeping, that is. 
 I bought this for my mother-in-law at her request.  She has arthritis and saw it on TV.  She also wanted the free gripper that came with it.  I scoured the listings at Amazon looking for one that included the gripper, even paid a little more for it.  She used the can opener once and it broke.  The "free" gripper required sending away for it and an inflated S&H fee 
 The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness 
 All one has to do is look at how our society raises men and women so differently,and there is your answer!He tries to run with biology being a source of all differences but he has no  evidence.How you're raised can determine your social behavior even your brain scans!The book is a waste of paper and time. His attempt to make sterotypes a fixed biological phenomenia  is laughable.He's done enough harm in the relationaship  between the sexes.His books kill relationships 
 First time I looked through this book, was curiosity of my local library.  Checked out, and was blown away with how cool this book is.  That was 9 months ago.    Being a big U2 fan-and since the price had dropped considerably-decided to buy the book.  After a few minutes of 'reading' it, realized how crappy the pictures in the book are.  Seemes like 90-99% of the pictures are washed out, grainy, and horribly reproduced here.  Was there any quality control as this book went to press?  And for those 'new, never before seen pictures' they are pretty ho hum.  Because its not totally horrid, I'd give it 2.5 stars.  Just, well,  disappointing.  If I had to pay the full MSRP, I'd give it ZERO stars.  While I must say, for $14 or so, you do get some good training on how heavy your next laptop will be... 
 this book was boring because it demeans fetishes. fetishes can be healthy outpourings of one's soul, not something that needs to be hidden away in the proverbial closet.  i have a foot fetish, and this book gave me the  impression that fetishes are to be spurned: i disagree and disagree  strongly.  my fetish is something integral to my being; i live for feet 
 This book attempts to offer a rebuttal to selective points argued in The Case for Christ. It is very hard to provide evidence for something that happened 2000 years ago. Try to prove that Socrates really existed, or try proving he didn't exist?   For example, if other historians at the time never mentioned Jesus, does that mean Jesus did not exist? No, it is impossible to DISPROVE Jesus just as it is impossible to completely prove Jesus existed. Saying the gospels are inconsistent and hard to believe is not proving Jesus didn't exist.   Can you prove who wrote the bible if the said authors didn't? Instead of trying to find inconsistencies in the gospels, can you prove, with evidence, Jesus never lived? If you can't prove with evidence that He didn't live, how do you expect someone to prove He did live?  The Case for Christ will make Christians happy. This book will make non-Christians happy. However, the book that actually talks with scholars themselves and gives them a chance to respond is The Case for Christ. 
 As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense.  While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting.  So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.    Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book 
 This book has little story and a lot of bad porn. Read only if you are into fairy sex 
 This was the first and only gang starr album i will ever buy.  The beats are actually pretty good, but the horribly slow and simplistic raps from Guru pulls this entire album down.  Guru is probably the worst rapper on the face of the earth, and he needs to stop embarassing himself.  Don't get me wrong, i think he's a decent producer, but his lyrical style lacks in every category.  His rhymes aren't complex, catchy, original, or fresh.  I'd rather listen do Dr Seuss spit "one fish, two fish" to GS beats than the guru, at least the nursery rhymes provide some imagination and more interesting flows than Guru's drab 'lyrics' which he probably wrote on a napkin walking into the recording studio.  His delivery is predictable, and increadibly weak, with no emotion, variation, or purpose for that matter.  PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS CD UNLESS YOU: 1. Want to waste $16 2. Have recently ran out of coasters 3. Have insomnia, and need something to make you fall asleep 4. Are tone-ass-deaf, coupled with an IQ of Fourteen. 
 Most of the other reviews have said it well, this book is a total waste of time and I wouldn't have told my wife to get this for me for x-mas had I seen who the "authors" were (I was basing my want for the book based on the title which sounded like it could have been very cool) Most of the "myths" aren't, has some very bad, inacurate and distorted facts, poor writing,  I could go on and on---I think the only reason I even finished it (mostly when taking a crap) is for the laughs I got on how stupid and ludicrous it was---If I could give this a negative star I would, in fact it pisses me off that I have to give this 1 star ---don't buy any Beatle book by these "authors"  they all stink 
 You really have to wonder how a person like "Dickie Richards" could exist, or why, if he's fictional, anyone would think that a book by such a character would be funny.  The title is a lie - the book doesn't teach you how to cheat, and the author repeatedly says he has no friends. I have no idea where they got the "157 classic and crafty tricks" line from.  That Penn would put his name on this book is just more evidence that, as a thinker and a writer, he's a pretty good magician 
 I bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but I've been disappointed. Previous to this I bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame. I need a wider angle lens and went for this one, but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results. Edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible, even at higher f stops. I shoot with a 20D.  The USM is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens I choose to buy in place of this one. The focal range of 28-105 was also very nice, but to me the picture quality was not so good 
 Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud 
 Sigh...  Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts.  Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line.  This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing.  So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score).  The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features "Think of Me" and "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" in their original form.  For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about.  So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out 
 I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o 
 This is the longest 466 page book that I have ever read.  The the Holy Bible is a quicker read. It was the first Peter Robinson book that I've read and undoubtedly the last.  Stephen King must have been paied handsomly to sing the praises of the Alan Banks series.  I can't believe that a book of this calibur was even publised in such an overloaded genre. In the words of Simon Cowell, "this book was absolutly deadfull.&quot 
 The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations 
 I was assigned this book for a graduate level substance abuse class at the seminary I attend.  I found the content quite shocking.  If you are a Christian, you should know that this book is probably not what you think.  May's theology will be strange to anyone who considers the Bible to be God's Word.  The beliefs that May lays out are a hodge-podge of Freudian psychodynamics, eastern religious traditions, Christianity, and gnosticism.   May's foundational premise is that human beings are basically good and that addictions subvert our goodness and redirect what he believes is our innate desire for God.  That is certainly contrary to the testimony of Scripture.    If you are looking for another secular humanistic treatise on addictions you will likely love this book. If you are looking for a Biblical treatment of addictions, you won't find what you are looking for here.  I would recommend Ed Welch's book, "Addictions: A Banquet in the Grave".  
 Micheal Moore is the Big Fat Stupid Liar. Incase anyone out there has not figured it out yet. Micheal Liar Moore Hates America so he should move to France. He has edited people speeches to suit his leftist ideology agenda and frankly he is just one big fat liar. Go Suck Saddam's, Michea 
 This book is the worst book i have ever read. It doesn't make any sense, and very hard to understand. I reccomend this book to no one 
 I bought this recording with high hopes.  What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?  Well, not with this recording.  The cast is made up of "distinguished actors," the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line.  The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!  When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  For audio recordings, you need the best voices.  Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this.  My advice?  Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums 
 The only reason I give it two stars is that the word problems and models are interesting and realistic.  The student solutions manual is a rip-off because it does not model each type of problem, nor does it lend itself to greater understanding and clarification.  I usually get straight "A's" in math courses because I pour all effort necessary into homework and understanding.  I just find myself being frustrated every time I open this book.  The examples in each chapter just give me a headache.  It is assuming and poorly written.  Colleges that require this book for courses in pre-calc and trig should think twice 
 If you think that by reading this book you will learn about histiography then think again. E.H.Carr was a Marxist; he was a member of a school of historians called the 'revisionist.' This lot where apologists for the  worst abuses of the Soviet Empire. Indeed many of them  denied Stalin was a  mass murderer and argued that if anyone was killed, it was for 'just'  reasons!  They regularly denounced the work of the great Robert Conquest  (he who got is right) as biased propoganda. But time does tell, doesn't it!  The Berlin Wall is down, Communism has collapsed under it's own internal  contradictions. So, where does this leave Mr Carr's book? Only read this  continuation of the Marxist historical method if you are a student of  Archaeology, because that is what the study of Marxism is now properly  called. All Carr's talk of class war, polarisation of society and the  ineviatble revolution is simply wrong. History is not an analytic subject  (as What is History? supposes it to be), but proceeds according to no  specific rules. To view history as an analytic discipline would be  historicist. This term was popularized by the great Sir Carl Popper in the  "Poverty of Historicism" and put to devastating effect in  "The Open Society and It's Enemies Volume II" (read both books,  they're masterpieces). Simply stated historicism is the notion that history  consists of discernable mechanical forces that once determined can form the  basis for a prophetic analysis. This is wrong. History does not act in this  fashion. Rather, given some event, one can not ever predict its  consequences due to the huge number of variables. The Doctrine of Unforseen  Outcomes is much more like it. We can have theories about what may occur,  but to be sure (remember the Marxists going on about the inevitability of  their revolution?) it to suppose determinism. Wrong, Wrong, Wrong; a bit  like the late Mr Carr 
 Didn't know Hoover was to blame for all the problems of the world...Thank God for people like President Clinton 
 Noam Chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the United States of America.  He has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing.  His world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved.  His infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the United States.  He has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of American foreign policy.  He goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the U.S. and Israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history.  His distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the "underdog," even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as Al Queda or Hezbollah.    Yet since 1955, hypocrite Chomsky has worked for the "overdog" Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of War and mass destruction, and continues to this very day.  Chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the United States and the Jewish State.  If he were not so attached to the freedom of making money, earning the adulation of the American Left, and freedom to express himself, he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in North Korea, Iran, or Syria.  Let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much, the United States of America.    God Bless America, which will continue to give Chomsky the right to speak, teach, and make lots of money.  Raybo 
 I usually love Patricia Cornwell's stuff but now it seems that she is getting so far away from her main character base that it all seems strange.  I am a funny reader and when I like something I like it to seem semi familiar.  This book felt odd and I didn't finish it. sorry 
 While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.)  The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin 
 The people on this review are crazy. This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. It was ridiculously stupid, and I hated it. It was assigned to me by my AP European History teacher for summer work, but I despised it. I tend to like books teachers require you to read, like the other book she required--All Quiet on the Western Front. I absolutely loved it.   Read this if: you like long-winded explanations about anything (She definitely gives you extremely detailed accounts on everything that is not important at all to the War.)  you like conversations in non-fiction books (How did that happen? I didn't realize people transcribed informal conversations between generals)...  you already know military tactics and are well-versed in European history...otherwise, you may be confused during many important parts of the book  you like war and don't care about the human suffering involved; Tuchman is heartless in her analysis--she barely describes any of the human stories of war  you enjoy being bored--you WILL be bored half the time  you desire only to learn about the first month of the war...   I HATED this book; I don't understand any of the comments thus far. This book was horrible; don't waste your time reading it. Learn about WWI somewhere else. I know there are better non-fiction about this conflict than this piece of toilet paper 
      Ya, sure Mandela is a great person, a personification of a accumulation of moral and ethical supremeness, but lets face it, this book sucks.  I had to read this for a high school english class, and it bored me to death.  So many facts, so many potentially useless information, its as if Mandela intentionally tried to put emphasis on the less entertaining portions in his life.  Personally, I dont see how all the other commentors could stand finishing this book.  Good story...badly written 
 I am a little disappointed in the upgrade to Microsoft Office as it is not user friendly nor is it as accommodating as the earlier version 
 A Recipe for Bees reminded me a lot of the novel Vinegar Hill. In both stories, a wife is living in a dark, unpleasant home environment. In A Recipe for Bees, Augusta, an older lady, approaching the end of her life, reflects back upon her childhood and her marriage. Her mother dies at a young age, leaving her alone with an unaffectionate father. When she meets Karl and they become married, Augusta moves from one unaffectionate household to another. Living at Karl's father's farm, Augusta is only subject to more withholding of affection and is living a dark and depressing life. The rest of the novel delves into Augusta's search for independence and what she chooses to make of her life. The story takes us down journeys of the ups and downs of marriage, being a misfit in the community, and mother/daughter relationships. The main problem reading it, is that I couldn't find it in me to like the main character, Augusta. I also felt that the story left the reader with a depressed feeling of what marriage is like.  The weaving of the "bee" theme added a nice touch to the story, but if you're looking for a great read with a "bee" them, try The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd. The writing in A Recipe for Bees was good, but I felt the story was lacking something 
 Every one is obbsessed with "Hips don't lie". Don't they relize that the songs horrible. Well, so is every other track on this album. Save your money to waste on something that is atleast some what decent 
 This book is a waste of time if you know anything about politics.  Every supposedly true "indictment" of the Senator that Ms. Carpenter makes is really just an unresearched piece of outside the Beltway dribble.  If you are from DC and work in politics here, as I do, you understand that nothing is quite as simple as the author makes it sound.  This book might be very interesting to people who hate Hillary and who could not care less about facts, truth, or context, but for those of us in the world who are educated about politics, this book will drive you to drink! Also, I saw the author on Fox News sometime last month, and she has zero ability to back up any of her claims when pressed by a journalist.  Ms. Carpenter should have spent more time on factual research and less time on doing her garish makeup.  Don't waste your money on this book 
 Laughably weak effort -- the "running book" equivalent of a 9 hr marathon.  The advice is incredibly banal.  I bought it used for the postage plus 1 cent and still felt cheated. Unreal that this kind of junk gets published 
 I read this book with anticipation since I lost my mother to suicide.  Nevertheless, the book seems to be written only as a conduit to Suicide Survivor Support Groups; other grief materials are far more effective and ultimately superior 
 I have always been an avid fan of Westerns in general, and Charlton Heston in particular, but this is one of those movies where the legend surrounding it far exceeds the actual viewing, even allowing for its having been butchered by the studios Charlton Heston of course, plays Major Dundee, a man with a very forceful character - resolute, determined, and even rebellious ("invading" Mexico and attacking the French army).  For such a man to later be found as a hopeless drunk wallowing in the gutters of Durango is thoroughly incomprehensible. The purpose of the "invasion" of Mexico is to capture or destroy the Apache Indian, Charriba, so one would expect the audience to watch the movie in anticipation of a great climax when the two sides finally meet.  When they do meet however, the action is over in less than a minute, and Charriba is simply shot by Michael Anderson Jnr.  So the climax is, in my view, an anti-climax. We are then presented with a new climax, when Dundee and his men have to defeat the French army in order to get back across the Rio Grande.  Although this encounter is a lot more exciting than the one with the Apaches, the overall effect, as far as I am concerned, is rather like the effect one gets when reading a murder mystery to discover that the murderer is somebody who only entered in the final pages (and the scene where a wounded Richard Harris single-handedly takes on the other half of the French army is so unexpected in view of what has gone on before, as to be virtually unbelieveable). With regard to the movie having been heavily cut by the studios, I would suggest that if any cuts had to be made, they should have cut the Durango scenes entirely, plus all of the scenes featuring Senta Berger.  Romance only slows down the action and adds nothing to the story, whilst too much romance leads to boredom. Finally, having watched the movie with the new score first, and then with the original score, I have to say that I preferred the original. The movie opens with Charriba saying to an upside down strung-up soldier, "Who are you going to send after me now?"  The original then has the opening title, "Major Dundee," accompanied by the Mitch Miller Sing Along Gang singing the Major Dundee March.  To me this is a much more stirring and rousing score than the new replacement, and sets the scene for what one hopes will be an exciting movie. By all means buy this dvd as a piece of movie history, and as part of either a Charlton Heston or Sam Peckinpah collection (even though Peckinpah disowned it), but for my money don't expect a Western anything like as great as the likes of The Big Country, The Magnificent Seven, or How The West Was Won.  
 I am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale, and just say that I didn't enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned - its boring and repetitive. Maybe its because I'm not used to aimless - albeit eloquent -landscape descriptions, or maybe it's the fact that NOTHING happens for 264 pages, but reading this book felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience. Case in point: Casual readers beware 
 Just reading a review of this book is enough to know that this book is far from being a guide to for young Catholic women to the ways of holiness. This book appears to be another feeble attempt to encourage young ladies to laugh at their faith and to laugh at the Church. If you take being a Catholic seriously this is no book for you 
 Ok, these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand.  I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them.  That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence.  It was the holidays so I didn't immediately attribute it to the vines.  I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk.  Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself.  I have since thrown out all my other bags--these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem.  I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning "may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence! 
 Was looking for a book geared for RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 system admins looking for info on configuring RAID with mdadm, lvm2, and ended up with a book more geared for a desktop user more interested in games and novelties than serious system administration. I really don't think the book is geared toward Enterprise users and the word "Enterprise" should not be in the title. For what it goes over it does a good job but I was expecting more core unix admin information and examples 
 i liken this book to fitzgerald's "tender is the night." and that is not a good thing. people of no substance plod through hundreds of dull dull pages. are people really this shallow? this empty? probably. but, my god, do i have to read about them? no. i do not. i simply could not finish this book (and that is rare). i wasted valuble reading time for about 300 pages, then had to admit it just wasn't working. because of all the critical acclaim this book recieved, i was very much looking forward to reading it. what a major disappointment! i am truly puzzled by the positive response this thing gets from so many people. great writing? really? i just did not see much of that here. shouldn't a book have at least one interesting character in it? it seems that dullness is making a comback in critical circles these days. too bad 
 The idea of the sudser was really neat, but in reality it is difficult to use.  The age min. said 18 months, but that is far from accurate.  My two year old couldn't make it work and my four year old gave up on it because there was not a significant amount of bubbles produced.  I am disappointed because I just expected it to be cooler and more exciting to them, with cost and shipping $16 is a lot for a dud of a toy, especially a bath tub toy 
 I've read and enjoyed other Elizabeth George mysteries and I like the smart but pathetic and hopelessly unfashionable detective Barbara Havers.  However, after struggling through the interminable interior monologue of a 3-year old violin player that opens this book, I thought: why in the world am I reading an over-stuffed mystery novel that is 700 pages long?  Don't I have something better to do with my time?  Well, I do -- I'll read a biography of Jesse James who was at least a real person and a criminal of some note.        Take this review as a protest against 700 page mystery novels.  A mystery should be brief and tight -- capable of being read and enjoyed in a day or two.        Smallchief   
 This book has one quality: it is reasonably well-researched and talks about recent (mid-90's) discoveries. With that said, the book is overall quite disappointing. The biggest problem about this book is that if the reader has a scientific background, or even is a serious amateur, he or she will be turned off by the many mistakes and inaccuracies in this book. I will mention just one example, when Aczel writes: "Then there is the motion of all stars (detectable in observations of distant galaxies) away from each other due to the expansion of our universe." This is very misleading, since it implies that stars in the same galaxy are moving away from each other due to the expansion of the universe, a gross mistake. This could be a typo, but it's hard to give the author the benefit of the doubt, given the large number of other inaccuracies in the book. This book looks like it was not reviewed. It's hard to believe that Martin Gardner, one of my favorite authors, gave a positive review of this book, as suggested by the quote in my edition 
 Don't spend your hard-earned money on this book. If you really want to learn about developing content for the Web, buy a good grammar book, a good style book and a good Web design book.  "Developing Online Content" is little more than a rehash of other publications, inflated with meaningless graphics and unnecessary new terms.  The only worthwhile parts of the book are the lists of resources 
 I'm a big fan of the Klutz line in general, but this one was a major disappointment.  After having much success and fun with their Beadlings and Beaded Rings books, and being both a lifelong crafter and an experienced knitter & crocheter, I thought the Spool Knitting book would be fun & easy to take on.  What a great idea, adding beads and elastic into the spool knitting craft!  However, this kit turned out to be a great idea that was very poorly executed by Klutz.  BEAD AND CORD ISSUES:   The smaller beads supplied in the kit are WAAAYYYY too small in diameter to easily string on the narrowest elastic cord supplied in the kit, and even after following the book's suggestion to dip my elastic cord ends in clear nail polish, they continued to fray and I continued to struggle with stringing the supplied beads.  It was more frustrating than fun, and I couldn't substitute my own, larger-holed beads because they'd be too big to pass through the supplied knitting spool.    SPOOL ISSUES: When using the wider elastic cord and slightly larger beads from the kit, it's hard to fit the beads between the spokes of the knitting spool.  Also, the knitted tube must be forced through the knitting spool because the spool's center hole isn't wide enough to easily accomodate a beaded tube.  The result is more fraying and more frustration.    I ended up dumping the supplied beads into my general beading stash and giving the elastic cord to my neices to make themselves necklaces by stringing some of my own beads on the cord.  Klutz should've supplied narrower elastic cord for use with the smallest beads (or if that wasn't possible, small-size beads with larger holes in them), and and a wider-diameter knitting spool.  I still have no use for the Klutz knitting spool, as it's too small for use with regular yarn.    Klutz was always my "go-to" for reliably fun, easy, quality craft kits, especially for kits to use with kids; unfortunately, now I'm going to have to check their stuff out just as thoroughly as I would any non-Klutz kit, and test their kits out myself before getting the kids involved.  
 I was very disappointed in this item. They stickers did not stay in the book. they would fall off or only part of them would stick . would never buy again. it would have been great if they did.concept is very nic 
 I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.   
 I was under the impression that this was a literary magazine that would be full of fiction, short stories, essays, book reviews, and literary criticism. Instead I received a magazine that discusses political issues. Does the magazine know what it wants to be? They recently released a special fiction issue on the newsstands. Why would they if they're becoming a political magazine?  Do they want to be a news/political magazines such as Time, U.S. News & World Report, and Newsweek or do they want to be a literary magazine?   They're doing a poor job of establishing themselves and drawing the line of what they want to be. I regret subscribing because I felt mislead. Of course for The Atlantic staff, turning the magazine into a political direction will probably bring them more sales. I don't think that reading and literary magazines are dead by any means but the format needs to be revamped so that people will want to read it. 
 Chomsky's anti-America, anti-Israel screed is purely for those who live in a fantasy world where every problem in the world can be safely contained and blamed on America, and shades of gray are firmly verboten.  For those who have to live and work in the real world, where bad people do bad things based on personal motives and desires that cannot be, somehow and inevitably, traced back to American government of business, it's utterly worthless.  There are much better books out there about understanding the Israeli-Palestinian issue, and/or the role of the US in that dispute or in the Middle East in general that take hard looks at the issue.  Israel is certainly not without culpability in the ongoing problems with Palestinians, but Chomsky lacks the objectivity, apparently, to exmanine the issue in a productive, reasoned manner.  For those who are safely ensconced on a college campus somewhere, this may be a decent book that will support illusions about human nature and the badness of American government.  For those who have matriculated out into reality, spend your money elsewhere on a better book 
 This book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it.  Although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming, much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive.  In the first chapter, Kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations, which boils down to his belief that Moore's Law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the Big Bang to the evolution of life on Earth and now the evolution of technology.  The second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself:  just as evolution "intelligently" created us, we will (soon!) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us.  It is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways, but the book to this point is best skimmed, because there's actually very little substance and a lot of dry, pseudo-intellectual filler.  Chapter 3 examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers:  what is consciousness, and can machines possess it?  Kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here (his sentences on Descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy), though he does not try to decide between them.  Instead, his prediction is social:  eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now.  This theme comes up again and again, and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book.  Chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence, where it has been, and where it needs to go.  In a section entitled "The Formula for Intelligence", Kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong AI of the future:  recursion, neural nets, and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain.  This wishful thinking is one of the Achilles' heels of this book.  For a software entrepreneuer, Kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence:  software is hardly becoming more complex or "intelligent" at all, let alone exponentially.  Today's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly "smarter" than systems of past decades, and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations.  Despite Moore's Law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world, progress in the world of software seems, to this software engineer of 15 years, to be nearly a flat line, not an exponential curve.  Just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of Windows, versus what it would take to design and implement Kurzweil's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software.  Part of the problem may be that Kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology, which are in their infancy.  He does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved (probably by geniuses) in order to create "strong AI."  Instead, the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic:  brain deciphering, massively parallel hardware, and genetic algorithms.  Part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies.  The most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers, and he doesn't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer, so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person's mind.  Kurzweil, in his materialism, does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible.  He also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality.  Part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009, 2019, 2029, and 2099.  This book was written in 1999, and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999, while others wildly miss the mark, such as:  "the majority of reading is done on displays", "the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition", and "intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel."  That Kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20-, 30-, and 100-year predictions.  Indeed, his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel, and of the ones that sound plausible I think he must be off by at least 30 years.  His speculations for 2029 are just fantastic.  In general he seems to "predict" based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available, underestimating a myriad of resisting factors:  legal, political, social, market, scientific, etc.  Ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues, but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity, there's plenty of foolishness to be found in here 
 This seems like a great idea - the food is held in a basket, so that you don't have to shove a skewer through the meat. However, the little bolts that hold down the clamp onto the rack are meant to be tightened by hand. If you have a sizable chicken, you cannot tighten these enough by hand. I had the chicken fall out of the rack into the flames more than once. Then you have to tighten them with pliers, but the metal is so soft that you can only do this 2 or 3 times, and then the threads are stripped and the whole thing is useless! Again: hand tighten = chicken falls out; tighten with pliers = threads are stripped. Now I have to try to get replacement parts for the rotisserie from Weber. Good luck 
 Having used this book for a few semesters, I offer you this: Avoid this book, unless you too are an academic who has nothing real to offer the world of video games in terms of game design or actual game production.    If you are the same type of person that enjoys diagramming sentences or likes to discuss why other people have created artistic things in the manner they did - rather than create something yourself, then you may enjoy this.  [...] I am of the opinion that a person writing on such a topic might be better equipped to do so after having designed a few AAA titles.  Then again, people like that tend to be busy working on games.    Buyer beware. I was required to buy this book and was unable to "Dodge this bullet".  To each, their own 
 This short novel started off ok, but it was not long before my brain was awash in confusion. This is a highly abstract experimental novel that makes little if any sense. Without question the author has a wonderful vocabulary and on occasion really knows how to turn a phrase, but she doesn't seem to know how to put her natural talents to their best use. The reader never gets to know the characters (and quite frankly doesn't want to get to know them) because they are so flat--less than flat. Furthermore, the narrator does anything but narrate the story because he is always too busy calling attention to himself and the fact that he is narrating a story that no one gives a s**t about. There is no plot and the overall idea is as hopeless as they come--TRULY HOPELESS. I really wanted to like this work and I pushed on, almost against my will to finish, but all I was left with was a disappointment that bordered on downright despair. For such a slim book, this may have been one of the most cumbersome ordeals I have put myself through as of late. Simply put, there are millions of better things out there to read and I should probably note that this is the only book I have ever awarded a one star rating--this is because zero stars is not an option 
 I read the book to see how far Lindsey could go,and it's way too far.This book is nothing but hate filled lies to flame up the hate against Islam by evangelical neocons who want to make  their form of Christianty the main religion in the world.I'm terrified by how many people but into Lindsey's mindset.It's a  tragic time we live in when all that matters is using religion for power and economic controll.He refuses to see the mistakes the United States has made to support Israel at all costs,especially our security.He has absolutely no understanding of cause and effect,of how we are in the mess we in now.Muslims aren't the ones destroying Christianty,it's  people like Lindsey who make followers into rabid Islam  hating war mongers 
 As a Russian Student at Moscow Lomonsov State University, my whole education is surrounded by Russia, Russians, and most of all history. I love it. But I don't love this book. I've had it for almost three years and still can't get around to finishing it all. It's a big, big book. One of the reason why I love history books so much is because they are a bargain! However that didn't turn me off, I actually was quite happy with the amount of information and the color excepts were fantastic. I can tell the author is enthusiasm for the cultural history because it goes from speaking about traveling musicians to how Peter the Great abhorred the unwesternized ways of Moscow. I mean, it goes from one thing to an completely different topic in only a paragraph on one page, and then picks up back with describing the local music of the small villages. The information is so rich and he wants to describe everything to us at once that the reader can get so overwhelmed and lost that it becomes boring to read. It isn't my first history book and I have so many unexciting textbooks I have to read, but I rather read my law book -- in Cyrillic -- then attempt to actually finish this book. You would think with around 700 pages he would be able to take his time. No doubt, this is for the serious reader and someone who is in need to cite something for their term paper (the index works very well indeed, that's one star) and the major information it gives you that you could hardly find in a text book (that's another star) but as reading you  
 There are not many books that I read that I find boring, but unfortunately this was one of them.  I was especially dissapointed after all the glowing reviews saying how funny this book was supposed to be. I found it very repetitive and dull. I also agree with other reviewers who wonder what the whole side-story about the tractor book was for. Those readings from the father's history book were especially boring.  It also took me more than a week to finally finish this since I just couldn't get into it. It was just silly episodes about the eccentric father and greedy, but supposedly, stunningly-beautiful Valentina over and over.  The author tried to delve a little into the history of why the sister was the way she was and about the horrors of war but then left us with no clear ideas about what she thought about these topics. We also never quite know whether Valentina is a good or bad person. Luckily I didn't pay much for this because I bought it second-hand from Ebay.  I wish I'd gotton it out of the library instead. Not worth the time it takes to read since there are much better books out there.  I learned nothing from this book and can't even say I entertained by it either.   
 Very Pretty but a limited number of arms and my family was not even in the book.  For such an expensive work, I expected my family to be there 
 We bought this lunch box (2 times now) and my son of course loves it.  I liked that it came with its own tupperware and cup.  My problem with this box is that my son is three, so of course completely independent, and the lunch box is not as durable as one would like.  He has dropped it twice, and both times it has broken, once the clips to close it fell off and the other a big hole in the bottom.  I feel that it should be a little more durable given its clientel. It is however his favorite. 
 This has to be one of the most simplistic books I have ever read.  It reminds me of one of those biographies written by a not-to-bright athelete "as told to" a mediocre small town newspaper writer.  I think that Ms Garrett wrote the book because she needed money. Derek Bloomfiel 
 I bought this DVD thinking I could get what my Pilates class gives me right at home.  Boy was I wrong.  This is a horrible example of Pilates.  The sessions just goes through the motions.  They don't emphasize the importance of form and breathing through out each session which is really needed for any skill level.  The transitions are way too fast.  Maybe I am spoiled by having such a great Pilates teacher but this DVD is a waste of money!  
 I visited Ireland from the U.S. and my hair dryer sparked when I used the adapter and fried both of them. Also I had a convertor for my iPod, but was unable then to use the adapter. The USB charger never worked. Oh well, live and learn. 
 I am Christian, and I also have been diagnosed with depression.  When I received this book, I opened it expecting anecdotes and little things to do in my daily living to help me get through my depression.  However, the book  focuses entirely on Christianity.  Phrases such as "The person who is  depressed should ask himself what he is doing to make himself depressed.   He may discover that he is living a lifestyle that is clearly against  God."  For those to which this statement applies, the book could be  very helpful.  The authors believe that depression is some sort of mindset  that can be easily overcome, not a real disease that millions deal with  daily.  If you want tangible ways to overcome depression, beyond prayer and  an active relationship with God, then look elsewhere 
 The perspective of John Crossan is just another attempt to interpret history to suit an agenda. This agenda has been posited by other authors today that relay facts that are either only excerpts, thus revealing only a vague half-story that they then build their mistaken interpretation on, or they blatantly make illogical statements.   In particular, Crossan states that empires, like Rome or even America, are guided by the premise of "victory and peace", namely that they aggressively engage war, achieve victory and then acquire peace. This he says is like Augustus' Pax Romana, which he sees as a false type of peace because it was achieved through bloody war. He even goes so far as to insinuate barbarism in their motives. Meanwhile, he states that the Christian movement was guided by the premise of "justice and peace", namely that non-violent and just methods were utilized to achieve peace.   This all sounds so clean and perfect on paper BUT the crux of his deeply flawed perspective is that it took place not on paper but in the real world. Crossan, and others like him, posit an ideological philosophy of peace that sits securely on parchment but has never worked in practice, as the real world is imbued with many variables, such as nepotism, greed, and even alien, non-assimilating factions that never make this beautiful ideal reach fruition. This ideal he speaks of sounds wonderful, and I personally would love it if such a mindset could pervade the entire world, but anyone who knows history knows that it never did and never will. All one needs to do is look how Jihadist radical Muslims think, and how their innate and intense hatred of the Christian and Jewish infidels makes this dream of peaceful harmony a complete and total impossibility.   Crossan also wrongly criticizes ancient people and civilizations that fought to survive. As he points out, Augustus knew he could not penetrate Germany, and as such, he even offered the sound advice for his successors to not attempt such a risky maneuver. Augustus was smart enough to know that strength and longevity of a nation only have a chance if that nation is sizable and strong enough to ward off attacks, because the REAL barbarians of the ancient world just so happened to be the Germans, who lived in mud huts and lived like animals. This Crossan is too blind to see, for it was Rome that bequeathed to Western Civilization its strong foundation for survival. This foundation was for a real world that is perpetually inundated with real barbarians. The Founding Fathers of America were wise enough to follow that precedent, and hence that is why America is the world leader it is today. Likewise, ancient leaders, like Augustus, cannot and must not be judged by modern standards. Even religious prophets such as Moses condoned slavery, so who is Crossan or anyone else today to criticize these ancient people that lived in a much different world? Their lack of understanding this basic principle makes them unsuited for writing about history.   Likewise, his attacks on Roman civilization for aggressively fighting for conquest can easily be countered with the bloody Crusades or the Inquisition, which as the famous historian William Durant pointed out, killed more fellow Christians than all the Roman persecutions against Christians combined. So, please, never forget that.  The bottom line is that Crossan's benevolent view is deeply flawed, as it attempts to eradicate the evil of mankind, which has reared its ugly face in both the secular and Christian realms. Even the Bible states that not all people are deserving of salvation, henceforth, evil is a reality that will be with mankind forever. Therefore, his pious attitude towards Christianity and his vile criticisms towards Rome or even the New Rome (America) are idyllic in nature and profoundly erroneous when applied to nature 
 We ordered this table twice and both times it shipped with out a base.  Amazon assured us the table would be complete the second time we ordered it, but we still ended up with a top and no base.  We were told the shippment from The Carolina Table and Chair company was to blame and the table would be pulled from Amazon until they got the complete table.  It is still on the web site and I suspect it is still incomplete 
 I did not find this book entertaining or informative.  It appears to be a general survey work, lacking in testable theories, and largely the result of data mining.  Terms are loosely defined, and the "Scientific" portions of the data are laughable.  One chart claims to represent "Political affiliation of residents who have primitive art, by their attitude to the art" and, remarkably, people have only two attitudes at all - co-equal with western art, or "disrepect or in Darwinian terms"  Even better, the total who view with "disrespect" was 15 people.  Quite the illustrative survey.  The sort of garbage that gives all liberal arts a bad name 
 I bought these for my younger than three month old son, he didn't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt.  I ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together.  I do not suggest that anyone buy these 
 Whole Foods does not = Macrobiotics as this author has decided. Whole Foods includes meat, very heartily, as it is a "whole food". I planned on a book full of recipes including snacks, which are very hard to think of, and was disappointed. The copy is trite and recipes are not very helpful regardless 
 Mr. O'Nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing.  His skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people, events, etc., is downright frustrating and confuses the project.  Unlike superior literary treatments (see Walter Lord's TITANIC), this book leave you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long, hot shower.  
 I was very disappointed with this book.  Although the writing is competent, the story could have been written as a short story.  Based on the reviews, I was expecting a psychological thriller in the tradition of Spider or Butcher Boy.  I found this to be a simple exercise in an overly long dramatic monologue.  
 I have been reading this book aloud to fifth graders in a rural area, and I don't get it! I am very uncomfortable with the enthusiasm with which the book embraces violence as a staple of black family life. There is a chapter about a bully who does a "Maytag wash," scrubbing his smaller victims with snow and then flinging them against a chain link fence - apparently meant to be funny, but my audience of ten-year-olds just looked puzzled. In another chapter, the mother approaches naughty brother Byron with matches, Vaseline and bandages, intent upon burning his fingers as punishment. Fortunately, sister Joetta blows out the matches - also meant to be funny, I guess, but it is difficult for me to see the humor in child abuse. I might concede that this book is a valuable illustration of a particular time in history, but the Birmingham experience is overshadowed by the portrayal of African Americans as stupid and scary . . . not the lesson I had hoped for. 
 In a nutshell, the ludicrous scenarios and insinuations in this book are so stupid and insulting to ANYONE's intelligence that I'm surprised it got published at all. A lawyer wrote this garbage, huh? I wonder where he graduated from. Perhaps he obtained his 'degree' from the same place Scott Peterson got the 3 fake ones hanging on HIS wall? Unbelievable! Did this 'author', and I use this term loosely, EVER do any real research on this case?  This Dalton character who wrote this book obviously just needed a money fix. Must be a mediocre-at-best attorney to have to stoop to this level of ethical malfeasance. A total lack of integrity on his part is an issue as well.  For those who care about Laci Peterson and the TRUTH of her murder read Sharon Rocha's book, "For Laci" as well as Catherine Crier's Book, "A Deadly Game". Also, do some research on the investigation itself-a lot of information is in the public domain. If I could find information on this case myself, a lowly civilian, then surely Dalton could have. I just don't think he wanted to, frankly. I believe I could write a better and more accurate book all on my lonesome!  Skip this book unless you truly don't think Scott Peterson killed his wife and son.  
 I would have to disagree with the statement that Scary Movie 3 was the best movie ever made.  The movie was a complete mesh of other famous flicks, such as The Ring and Signs.  I wouldn't suggest that people would buy this movie because it's just humor thrown into odd places.  I've seen the movie five times, and although I laugh, it still isn't the greatest movie.  I'm just relieved that there wasn't as much language in this movie than in Scary Movie 2.  My God - they swore every other minute!  Anyway, buy The Ring or Signs if you want to see a really good movie 
 The book tries to reinvent science by computer experiments on CA and to justify this by a shaky "principle of computational equivalence". It is way too much a stretch. There are various statements in the book which show that the author misunderstood what science is all about. An example is that the author mixed up the scientific methodology and the content of science with the method used to describe science. Among the various chapters where the author tried to account for the areas of science, the shakiest one is its account for quantum physics. I encourage the readers to read the chapter carefully to see for themselves. Anyway, after reading the book, I have to sadly say that the book does not have what it takes to support its claim. The author wasted too much of his time and the readers', too. Potential readers: don't waste your money on the book. If you need to read it to see how confused the author is, just check it out in the book store or from you local library if possible 
 When I first got diagnosed with ADD (as an adult) I believe the exact phrase "You mean I'm not lazy, crazy or stupid?" went through my mind.  FINALLY, there was an explanation.    So when I heard about a book by that name, certainly I had to check it out.  Once I did though, I was sorely disappointed.   I have ADD, yes.  Nevertheless, I've still managed to get pretty far in life in spite of the "handycap" the authors of this book seem so eager to hide under.   It's been a while since I read it, but I have the distinct recollection of finding some new example of a "You can't succeed in the world because you are 'disabled'" mentality on every page.  You can't do this, you can't do that, you've failed and you will continue to fail - just accept it.   Excuse me?  I don't know about the authors of this book, but MY ADD makes me creative and intuitive and perceptive and just generally a genuinely unique and awesome person (egomania aside).  Where is this addressed?  Where are the helpful hints for harnessing THAT kind of potential?  If they're in there, I sure didn't see them.  All I found were new little tricks for combatting the "affliction" with which I am (oh so unfortunately) beset.  Using these tricks, I can hope against hope for some semblence of a "normal" life they say.  Thanks but no thanks.  I'm doing pretty well so far, and I refuse to feel like some sort of mental cripple.  If you, and the authors are happy considering yourself as something less than the rest of the world because of the way your mind works, feel free - this is the perfect book for you.  But you can count me out.  
 I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime 
 I have read hundreds of true crime books and I followed the story of Lori Hacking in the news very closely.  So when I was on vacation and was looking for a book to read on the airplane, I was happy to see that a book had been written about Lori's story.  I am now very disappointed that I did not have the benefit of Amazon's customer reviews before wasting my money on this book.  The author did not talk to any family members (save maybe Paul, who had one or two quotes in the entire book).  The book was written from a reporter's perspective and added no detail that I had not already read in news reports when the story was unfolding several years ago.  He even quoted the National Enquirer.  Here are some quotes from this book:  "While Winslow had his scoop, and would lead others to the story, the Deseret Morning News held an edge.  The paper, which had been founded by Brigham Young, would make the playing field uneven for other news outlets working the story.  Throughout coverage of the case, journalists from the Deseret Morning News got access to family members of Lori and Mark Hacking when other news outlets did not.  Why should journalists from the old Deseret News and Church-owned KSL get all the leads?" (p. 108)  "The AP reporter hadn't paid much attention to the missing persons story out of City Creek Canyon when it first broke.  After all, it was local and would be of only passing interest to the wire service clients who subscribed at radio and television stations and newspapers across Utah, much less the ones on the national wire.  But word travels fast among AP clients, and the wire service's Utah office learned that the North Carolina television station had broken a major story on the Hacking disappearance.  The AP reporter was now assigned full time to the story as the AP moved the item." (p. 133).  "Network television producers and guest bookers have a power that print journalists envy.  The lure of the camera, the desire to appear on national television, boils under the surface of a surprising number of ordinary citizens. . . .  But three outlets had an edge, and they covered both print and electronic news.  The Church-owned Deseret Morning News and KSL radio and television often managed to beat the competition, both in print and on the air." (p. 143-144).  "The editorial showed how out of touch the hierarchy of The Salt Lake Tribune had become in its ignorance of how major media work.  Worse, it demonstrated a shallow view fired by a desire of city fathers to manipulate the image of the city.  Members of the national media laughed when they read it and e-mailed it to their home offices, who laughed as well." (p. 149)  "Money is a lawyer's curse and blessing.  The curse is simple:  If there is a Hell, surely some of them will find their particular circle to roast on for defending their clients who paid them.  The blessing is equally simple:  They will live well, eat well, drink well, and have the most articulate friends around until that day comes and they face the Devil himself." (p. 153).  Anyone who writes true crime books should realize that the American system of justice includes the Constitutional right to an attorney for all accused of a felony, and to compare a defense attorney to the Devil for doing his or her job is ridiculous coming from a true-crime author.  The portion of the book describing the weeks when the police were digging through the landfill was torturous:  Page 172: "Tedium quickly became the norm, yet once in a while the search would stop as cops would walk over to look in the pit that had been dug.  When that happened, reporters scrambled, knowing only that the cops had broken the routine and were doing something different.  Maybe that meant they had found something.  The journalists sitting along the road joked among themselves that they were stationed in a media version of summer camp, although a smelly one.  Some brought lawn chairs, chips, cookies, and sodas."  For crying out loud.  It was at this part of the book that I began rolling my eyes on a regular basis at the absurdity of this story and the wonder that any publisher would accept it.  I try not to criticize a book without reading the entire thing, and because I was trapped on an airplane with nothing else to do, I finished this one.  It never got any better.  I cannot say that a news reporter would not find this book interesting, but I can certainly say that no one else will.  The story of Lori Hacking broke my heart.  I only hope that a really good author (Jerry Bledsoe, Carlton Stowers, Ann Rule, Charles Bosworth) will do us all a favor and tell Lori's story the way it should be told.  I would recommend to anyone "A Killer Among Us" by Charles Bosworth, Jr. -- a story about a husband who hired someone to kill his 28-year-old wife and the mother of his 4 children, Elizabeth DeCaro.  That book will make you cry, and you will feel the pain of each family member because Bosworth brings you inside each person's heart.  Elizabeth's memory was done justice by Bosworth, and I only hope that someday we can say the same for Lori 
 Please be careful with products used for food or water that have microban. If you decide to get this product or something like it, please make sure to observe the user carefully. I recently bought a food storage container with microban, I washed it out first before using it, put the food in and poured some for my cat. A few minutes after eating she vomited. She never vomits so my first thought was that the microban was the cause, but I decided to wait a day to see what happened. Sure enough, after every time she ate, she vomited. I bought more food, washed her bowl out and tried that. She didn't vomit again. She might just be very sensitive, but please take this into consideration 
 I generally really like well-researched historical fiction, and have been a big fan of Dorothy Dunnett and Philippa Gregory (though the latter takes a lot of liberties with history).  I was quite drawn into this book from the first sentence, and found the description of life on the manor rich and convincing.  But.  began to switch off around the time we discover Jacob Cullen is possessed?  haunted?  by a "Voice" that encouraged him to brutally kill a young boy, and then rape his new bride.  Jacob ends up in the New Model Army where he forms an intense relationship with Ferris, who is a naturally good man.  The descriptions of the war and the brutality are vivid and detailed.    After they get back to London, Ferris becomes obsessed with forming a common plot for "diggers," and he and Jacob form an intense homosexual romance.  At that point and for the rest of the book everything was rather overheated and lusty.  It seemed like every other page was a description of longing for the embrace or the sweetness between their legs etc.  I would have been equally bored if this had been a heterosexual couple, but I couldn't connect this simpering Ferris with the earlier Ferris, and Jacob's bouts of violence began to bore me.  The book ends when they've been kicked off the common brutally by the neighboring lord, with the implication that Jacob could have stopped it but just didn't, and Jacob is on a boat to America crying. The Voice is silent.   I feel as though I didn't get it. A number of readers here assume the Voice is a symptom of Jacob's schizophrenia or madness, but it's presented in the book as though it really is the devil.  Well, which? Did Jacob rape his own brother when he was a teenager, as implied in one scene?  I kind of resented the way the author withheled information from us-- it's first-person narration, but the author only conveniently reveals/remembers these types of things, when for the first 70-80 pages of the book, Jacob is presented as well-liked and decent.  It just seemed flashy.  The book's change in focus and tone felt somewhat ad hoc.      Lots of loose threads with Jacob's family.  Ultimately, I was disappointed.  After zooming through the first half, I just naturally slowed down and took a week to read the rest.  By then I was cottoning on that the author was never going to reveal the mysteries, that no one plot was going to develop in a satisfying way, and that she enjoyed vivid descriptions of violence and sex but not deeper characterizations.  She can definitely bring a period to life, but the characters were ultimately shadowy and the storytelling was disjointed 
 I thought the information in this book was not usefull to me in any way. I was really disapointed 
 Rossetti outlines the destructive impact of clergy abuse on the victim, the institutional church, and the parish community. As the Executive Vice-President and COO of St. Luke Institute, one of the main US Roman Catholic clergy psychiatric facilities, the author could have provided invaluable first-hand accounts of dealing with the church hierarchy's handling of clergy who abuse, including reassignment, failure to report the abuse to civil law enforcement authorities and failure to be forthright to parish communities who may have an abuser in their midst.  Missing from the book is carefully developed insight concerning how organizations like St. Luke Institute treat clergy offenders and how impact of the abuse on victim(s) is incorporated in the treatment and how the victim/s and parish community is prepared for the clergy abuser's release from treatment. The author stands in a position of knowing directly how the archbishops and bishops respond to victims both in terms of compassion and justice and inclusion of information on those experiences would have been insightful.  Additional insight into how offending clergy are monitored upon release from institutions like St. Luke Institute would have been a relevant chapter in the book. 
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun.  Quite the reverse.  He has cut it in half.  The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either.  Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half.  Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes  Even the plot is tissue-thin.  The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring.  Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction.  As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one.  He is capable of far better.  
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 We puchased this toy for our 9-month-old and ended up returning it to the store.  The concept and the looks of this toy are great, but as mentioned in other reviews, this toy is pretty noisy.  It's so noisy that we were afraid it could affect our daughter's attention or hearing.  The toy does not come with volume control, and the music can be annoying to some people like us.  Moreover,the motor to create the force to blow out the balls runs so loud that it ruins the whole fun intention of this toy.   
 These books have the most misleading titles! Unless you are teaching Sunday school bible classes, this book is mostly useless, because the only examples it gives you are about how to better teach the bible. The title says 'teach almost anything to pratically anyone'. That is so NOT TRUE. Sure, it gives you some pointers, but I feel I have to squeeze the text really hard to get some juice. I bought this book and 'Almost Every Answer for Practically Any Teacher' hoping to learn how to teach better, and to get in touch with modern teaching skills. What a disappointment and a waste of money! The other book went straight to the garbage can. Another thing: if all the examples of bible teaching were stripped out of the book, it would be half the size and, perhaps, a much more pleasurable read. Maybe it would even earn another star! 
 I agree with the last reviewer. I Love Shannon Drake's books. I could not get passed the first few chapters. I went back several times and even skipping through the book I couldn't get engaged in the story. There were too many characters. I think this book had trouble deciding if it was a romance novel or a historical.  
 Ugh. I did not even try to finish the book. It is full of sexual content. Not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature 
 This book makes you feel good but in a false way. There are not many examples and only few practice tests 
 Mario Van Peebles, Patsy Kensit, and Paula Marshall are all talented individuals whose talent went to waste in this film.  The storyline of crime busting werewolves was really dumb.  The main werewolf itself looked  like a joke in comparison to the werewolf in "An American Werewolf in  London" 
 I liked most of Cook's books. This one I skipped to the last pages having waded through 3/4 of it. I think there MUST be a way of getting a novel along other than the "I am a maverick doctor/lawyer/cop/engineer that will investigate this case to the end even if my bosses tell me it is closed because I am so emotionally involved with every single case that I cannot rest till I see it closed as I think it should". Then this guy JUST happens to be told about rats dying. And he JUST happens to get another case of the same type. And then (and this is simply so incredible that it is funny) he has this girl he is totally hot for in a romantic dinner together and they start talking about anthrax and botulism cases and then they go together to his house to...nononoo sorry, they both go off together (after desert of course) to talk to the husband of one of the victims to tell him to be careful with botulism!!! At night!!! In a loaned car!!! I mean, one cannot trust the agencies with that, no? And who can think about s*x when one is worried about botulism? Of course the husband is the russian bad guy. Add so many cliches about white trash and hip minorities you could sink a battleship, and you have this novel. Forget it. Read "Coma" instead, this book could induce you to a coma 
 I read in a magazine about how "wonderful" and full of "romance" this novel was and so I checked it out for a bit of summer reading only to discover that it wasn't wonderful or romantic at all.  The narration was witty and comical, but the outcome of the novel was frustrating and sad. As anyone will tell you, a young man named Charles is walking along the beach one day with his fiancee when they come across a forlorn young woman staring out at the sea. The rumors say that this young woman (Sarah) had her heart broken by a French L. who then left her for the sea, and that everyday she stares at the ocean in the hope that he will come back. She is dismissed as mad by the locals and works for a snobby old Catholic woman.  And yet, dispite all this, Charles is smitten by her.  He and the French L.'s woman cross pathes regulary by chance, until Charles finally sits down with her and asks her for her story: it only confirms what everyone else is saying: she slept with the French L. and he left her heartbroken.  ::SPOILERS:: Don't buy this novel. I can tell you what happens and save you ten bucks.   What happens next is this: Sarah is fired on the mere suspicion that she is having a tryst with said Charles. Sarah fires up (for the first time showing a temper) and declares that she is NOT fired -- she quits! She then storms from the hosue and disappears from the town alltogether. The  town goes on a manhunt for her -- but, of course, it's Charles who finds her.  Later, the two hook up in a hotel and have sex. When Charles's family and future father-in-law find out, he is stripped of his inheiritance, left poor and thoroughly humiliated, while Sarah has disappeared yet again . . . and yet he STILL  can not forget her! He travels the world, missing Sarah, until one say he locates her. She's been living with an artist.  Here are the alternate endings:  Ending one: Sarah and Charles meet, Charles is naturally upset, but all anger is forgotten when a little girl appears. It is his daughter. He stays and holds the child. End of story.  Ending two: Sarah and Charles meet, Charles is pissed off and yells at Sarah, who is trying to tell him that he's a father. Charles won't listen. He storms from the house and never gets to meet his daughter. End of story.  What a great story, huh? (Sarcasm) 
 Terry Pratchett is wonderful and I own everything he's ever written (or co-written)(well, not everything - I don't have his shopping lists). My fanhood began at a time when his non-Discworld books were not available in the US. It was in the bibliography darn it...finally found it via a used-books site reference to a bemused London 2nd-hand bookseller's place (his e-mail: "Are you sure?"). Paid triple the cover price plus shipping, so yes, I trust you recognize a fanatic here?   In addition, I much prefer cats over all other possible pets. I even like Jolliffe cartoons.   If anyone was ever more prejudiced in favor of a book before opening it...  It has its hilarious moments - I don't think Terry (may I call you Terry? Thank you, PS, great stuff, keep it up) could write an obituary without having a hilarious moment or two - but I found the majority of the writing cumbersome. Belabored. Shorn of repetitions and needless build-ups, this would make a wonderful humor column, but book-length, it suffers.   It was detrimentally inaccurate about cats. Well, it wasn't supposed to be a textbook. But, for example, the whole chapter about domestic cats being into time-travel loses a lot of punch when you know that there are plenty of wild feline species (about a quarter of them) that are small and domestic-looking. Making the argument that there's no sensible link between a cat and a lion (as opposed to between a dog and a wolf) is egregious. And there are other errors like that, which detract from the jokes by undermining their premises.  I've read the book three times over the years, thinking maybe it was just a Mood Thing, but I've yet to come away feeling like it was worth wading through all that for the laughs. My suspicion is that Terry really loves his wife and didn't exercise the same level of constructive criticism on her text that he did on himself (as with his rewrite of "Carpet People"). Or maybe Lyn is the really funny one and she forgave Terry too much? Either way, I'd say this is his weakest work (yes, I've read "Strata," too).                
 DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE HOLLYWOOD VERSION WITH HARRY CONNICK JR!!  I was greatly disappointed when I received this that it was a documentary.  Had I known, I wouldn't have purchased it.  However, for those of you who love these documentaries, it sounds like a great DVD.  The one star rating is for the lack of description on Amazon's part 
 Rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family's emergency kit (and ecologically smart to boot). While this product is satisfactory for, say, a science demonsration on the Faraday Principle, its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited.   To its credit: This flashlight was meant to last, and will stand extremes of water and temperature. When dropped into water, it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval. It's so sturdy tha, it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you can't say that about too many products.   Shake this light for a while, and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time. While you may read claims of up to one or two hours, a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes, and then you shake again. And again. As long as you don't mind the repetition, the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency. But don't entertain thoughts that you'll be able to read, find small objects, or perform any kind of detail work.  If you don't have a chance to compare this to its better competition, you might not know that say, the Sherpa Xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by. While no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you'll find in a traditional flashlight, your options are brighter if you stay away from the Diamond Gen. Invest in something more powerful and you'll find that a flashlight's usefulness becomes considerably greater.   This flashlight was disappointing, and useless in any practical context 
 This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
    This book is simply the rantings and tantrums of a man who cannot get God to answer to Him, so in prideful defiance, chooses to lose his own soul and walk away from the very One who created it.  The author has clearly never experienced a relationship with Jesus Christ. If he had, his title would have been "Why I rejected Christ" This author describes himself as an "apologist"--that would mean "explainer of a particular religion".    He also reveals that it was the "Christian community" who let him down when he was in crisis.  God is not mocked. Trials will draw out what is in the heart. Trials will reveal true believers and false converts. So the title of his book would have been more appropriately titled "Why I gave up trying to be a fake Christian".   It is only KNOWING and loving God through the shed blood of Jesus Christ that constitutes a Christian. NOT some title of "Christianity" or apologetics.    It's NOT about theology. It's NOT about religion. What is it about? It IS about relationship.  Something that only comes from faith.    People will ALWAYS let you down. But God never fails. I would not recommend you waste your time on this book.     If you want to know about Christ, I recommend you start by reading the book of John and Revelation in the authorized King James Bible.     There is no subject more important than eternal salvation. There are many that would try to lead others astray. They are the blind leading the blind.  This book is one of them.     
 it is no problem to admit that i heartily envy ms kushner writing skill: she is a wondrous writer, she handles her language with a subtlety unheard of and still she manages to avoid any overwriting, any mannerism.  the story itself, though, is not great: some reviewers say it is true to the legend: should it be really so, then the problem might lie in the original plot.  be it as it may, characterization is dull, except for the elderly couple, and elfland is lushiously boring, the queen being the worst of all.  the verses included are enjoyable 
 This book was interesting but midway through the book I wanted to tell him to get a real life and job in his educational background.  Sadly, I felt he never really achieved his real ability and just had a lot of excuses 
 I was a little dissappointed.  This is a funny book, and these are obviously funny guys.  The live show must be outrageous...but then, the live show probably has props.   That's what this book needs.    It's a lot of words....  a lot of funny words, but all crammed in together with no real break.   After about 30 pages, you start to anticipate how each subject will be addressed.  Kind of like this review, after the first part, you know what the rest will be like.  Imagine how much more interesting it would be if Amazon would let me illustrate my review....   imagine what a great book this would have been if they had chosen to use some ILLUSTRATIONS!!!  (If the cover say's "Funny book" when you see it... look at the cover again, and imagine it with just the words and no pictures.. that's the book.  p.s. Yes I often enjoy books without pictures.... but this wasn't one of them 
 Though the recipies in this book sound delicious this book is far from written for dummies as it claims. Being a beginning cook I find it hard to follow what would seem to be the basic instruction for each recipe. I get lost figuring out just how to cut an onion "coursely" as I've never done it before. There is even a figure missing from chapter 5 that is supposed to show a key ingredient for Braise Endive (what the heck is endive?) This book is obviously written for someone who has basic knowledge of cooking and its very frustrating to read. The instructions are too vague for beginners and the descriptions of techniques leave me wondering what the author is talking about. Not to mention each recipe expects that you have an entire kitchen full of gadgets at your disposal to prepare these fancy dishes. I think I'm going to have to find a different book to teach me to cook before I can dive into "Cooking for Dummies" and understand whats going on. Look for a different book! 
 this is the absolute worst book i have ever been forced to and have ever read. i would like to add that i made a very strong attempt to get more interested in the plot of this book because it was a school assignment, but jeez, this was cruel and unusual punishment. when i think of this book, the word that comes to mind is "torture". i like a number of books and i love to read, i usually don't have a problem with book assignments, but this was just...just really mean. If you are smart, you will take my advice and stay far away.  
 The Greens cookbook is a shoddy, carelessly dashed together list of recipes suitable for use only in a fully stocked restaurant kitchen. Another review pointed out that the recipes are not designed for use outside of the Greens' kitchen. Most recipes require (usually included in small print in the recipe itself) the previous completion of another exceptionally complicated recipe (often fanciful stocks, for which no substitutes are ever given). Some recipes require the previous completion of TWO other recipes, vegetarian shepherd's pie, for example, which should be a fairly simple recipe. Nearly a third of the recipes are pizzas, which I don't need a cookbook for) and the pizza dough recipe (again given in small print at the bottom) is for one 10-inch pizza. Who, I ask, is ever going to make individual pizzas at home? There are also no pictures. This is by far the most useless, arrogant, and user-unfriendly cookbook I have ever tried to cook with, the culinary equivalent of a punch to the kidneys 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 I read 560 pages of slow, long-winded prose and was rewarded with a hasty conclusion.  There was no ending to this book.  After making my way through extensive histories, foreign words, and confusing names worthy of any Russian novel, I was given five or six pages of slap-shod resolution.  I understand that this book is only the beginning of an ongoing series, yet the Harry Potter series, the most well-known, epic young adult fantasy, features definitive conclusions within each volume.  Mark Twain said that if he had more time, he would have written a shorter book.  Sherwood Smith should have taken more time with this book.  I love the Crown/Court Duel books.  They are gripping, concise, and ultimately rewarding.  Inda is nothing like those books, despite being set in the same world.  Some of the ideas and story lines were entertaining and even gripping.  However, any enjoyment I received from the story was swallowed by my overwhelming disappointment at the conclusion mixed with my impatience for the story to move forward.  Overall, this book was a waste of my time.  
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 The book made a huge impression on me 35 years ago. I fell in love with the story and was envious of Sam's year in the wilderness.  Last night, I found the movie for sale at a local book/music/DVD store. I vaguely remembered that My Side of the Mountain had also been a movie way back when, but I had forgotten all about it. I bought the movie and my wife and I watched it.  Ugh. This movie was a waste of time. It was poorly written, abysmally acted, and strayed so far from the book that it was virtually unrecognizable to anyone who read and loved the book.  My wife and I got the impression that the movie was adapted by someone who doesn't like hunting or killing of animals. Reference after reference was made in the movie to guns and hunters being bad, killing animals being bad and even Frightful was killed by a hunter apparently out shooting for sport. So Sam never got his deerskin outfit (as he did in the book). Instead, he bought leather gloves and wore some kind of yellow rain slicker during the winter.  At one point near the end, when Bando returned to visit, there were so many people in Sam's hollowed out tree that I could have sworn it was a magic tree, much like the magic tents in the latest Harry Potter movie. Small from the outside. But huge on the inside.  What an awful movie. Even the cinematography was horrid. If I had to watch Frightful fly around for minutes on end one more time I might have shot her myself.  Avoid this movie at all costs!  But please, do, read the book. It's one of the best children's' novels ever published 
 I thought this book would have some really nice looking ideas and info.  It is a "cute" book more for beginners... I wasn't happy with the substance 
 Instead of actually showing any handy numerical processes used to figure out problems, this book tries to tell you via overly-wordy and remarkably garbled explanations in the middle of "real world" situations gathered from statistics.  The authors' idea of "Informal" apparently means burying explanations under useless jargon.  If you want to pass a Calculus class and don't already have a talent for mathematics, this is not the book to use.  Use something that's straight to the point and ditch the "Informal Approach" 
 This would probably be a great book to read if you are in the habit of reading a few pages here and there and easily forget what is going on.  To read it a few chapters at a time is almost torture.  This book could have easily have been 50 pages if we weren't reminded every paragraph that Sasha is 9 years older than Liam and he is a wacky artist and his family pushed him away and he can't be controlled and she is so very successful...blah, blah, blah.  Historically, I have really enjoyed Danielle Steele's books but this is one to skip 
 This unfounded work is by far the worst case of historical revisionism I have yet to encounter in my studies.  I was assigned this book in a history course, and found it to be extremely biased with no references whatsoever.  Michael CC Adams simply notes things such as "various editions of Time Magazine from the 1940's" as his references.  Adams makes broad claims that he fails to backup.    He does not include both sides of the story.  For example, when talking about the battle of Okinawa he states that ONLY 7,000 Americans (the lowest figure I have ever encountered anywhere is 13,000) died whereas the United States "brutally" killed 110,000 Japanese.  Adams does not even mention the enslavement of the Okinawan people by the Japanese forces or the extreme difficulties involved in taking such a difficult objective.  He states "over 1500 shells were expended per Japanese kill", claiming this was "overkill."  This is just one example of his twisted view of World War II.    If someone is going to undertake such an extreme view of the past, they should certainly reference it, and include both sides of the story.  
 There have been a number of powerful arguments made over time against the horrors of war. This book is not among them. Schell presents a rambling, naive, and trite rant in prose form, absolutely lacking any sense of structure or logic.   The core failing of the book is that Schell doesn't seem to understand what war is *for*. Because this reality is not addressed, Schells is unable to develop alternative mechanisms that address the core reasons for war -- and concrete alternative mechanisms are what is necessary here, not truism and tautology.  War in humans is similar to war in other creatures, primates, social insects, etc. War has always been a means of weeding out weak groups, of redistributing resources amoung humanity, of driving evolution and adaptability. Unless we develop the economic tools to achieve redistribution without violence, violence will always be the natural and *reasonable* final solution of those who find themselve to be stronger, yet who have less resources than others.  Despite the NY Times quote on the cover, there is *no* cogent argument in the book. A specific example: Schell claims repeatedly in the book that "nonviolent movements in Eastern Europe and in Russia [...] brought down the Soviet Union". Sure, there were nonviolent protests at the very *end* of the Soviet Union, and some major incidents over the years, but it is widely believed by economists that the Soviet Union was bankrupted by a  futile attempt to keep up with the United States in terms of the arms race. The USA could borrow money from the international capital markets to finance its cold war, the Soviet Union could not. America ended the war in massive long-term debt, the Soviet Union ended bankrupt. Yes, at the very end there were nonviolent protests, but these were a response to the fact that the Soviet Union was no longer able to function economically, not visa versa. Yes, some people in the Soviet Union protested, but rhetoric aside, it is clear that they protested because their standard of living was below that of the West, and they had been  told that "democracy" would make them wealthier. If the people of the Soviet Union had enjoyed greater prosperity than the West, there would have been no protests. This seems obvious.  Another example. Schell repeatedly cites and praises the nonviolence recommended by Christ, the nonviolence of Ghandi, and the nonviolence of MLK.  Schell seems utterly oblivious to the fact that in all these cases the nonviolence option was used simply because of the participant's lack of other options, in particular, military power. If the Jews had been kicking Roman posterior, they would have had no time for prophets of nonviolence. If the Indians were doing likewise versus the British we would never have heard of Ghandi. The same goes for MLK. In every case that Schell cites, nonviolence was forced upon the participants due to lack of other options: for example, the superpower "nonviolent" stalemate during the cold war. Nonviolence, then, became the most efficient option for the protagonists... not the most "moral" or "righteous".  What Schell fails to recognize is that humans desperately want to redistribute resources. It is one of the most basic and powerful drives we see in humanity. We will use whatever tools are most efficient for the task at hand, and in many cases the tool has been war. In other cases the most efficient tool has been nonviolent protest. In other cases the tool has been capitalism -- or communism. But to eliminate war, we must recognize that war has always had a legitimate purpose in the development of Man, and from there, we must strive to create more efficient options -- not merely blithely state that "violence [is] always a mark of human failure and a bringer of sorrow" and assume that any option developed will be preferable.  Not good 
 If you know the opera by heart, have performed it countless times, then you know that no recording is as good as the orginal 1951 recording.  I find it difficult to listen to any other.  I wish that it would be released again 
 I have been working with computers professionally for over 20 years.  Recently a client asked me to take the Security+ exam.  I bought a copy of Mike Meyers' Certification Passport Security+ book and took the tests at the end of all 14 chapters to see what I needed to study.  I missed 7 out of the 140 questions, or scored 95%.  I felt I was ready to take the Security+ without any further study.  I just returned from taking the test.  I scored 764, with a 764 being the minimum score to pass.  I am totally humiliated.  I am absolutely ashamed to show my client the 746 score after believing I would have a score I could be proud of.  FYI, when another client asked me to take the Net+, I scored 900.  That was a year ago and I used ExamCram Net+ to guage my readiness to take the Net+.  The ExamCram chapter tests were a much better reflection of the Net+ than the way Mike Meyers' Certification Passport Security+ book reflects the Security+ 
 I'd be okay with a story that had 1 or 2 last-second escapes, but this book has at least 10, if not more!  I think the author spent too much time watching action films and incorporated every single escape trick into one book.  Even a Bond film would not go this far out on a limb.  They only other Reilly book I've read is The Contest, which I suppose was just as far fetched, but I give that one more latitude since it was science fiction and this one is not.  Another complaint is that a 16th century manuscript is woven into the story - which is not a bad idea - but there was no effort at all to change the language to the appropriate era.  The book does have a lot of action though... so if you like wild adventure and can completely suspend reality, you'd probably enjoy.  Appropriateness:  I would like to have recommended this as a fun action book for teens, but be aware that it contains a lot of language and a lot of violence.  There are many gruesome deaths of all varieties.  There is no sexual content or discussion of it 
 No wonder they are selling a 30 dollar toy for 5 bucks, it does not work and the quality is sub par.  I have three boys so we get alot of hotwheels toys and this one is the worst I have seen.  Do not take if it was free.  Garbarge and disappointment await.  I gave one star because you have to, but I would give negitive stars if I could 
 I usually don't buy a book until I borrow it from the library first and look it over, but people said such wonderful things about this cookbook that I bought it sight unseen. (I'm a flybaby and heard about it there.) My husband, who is pretty easy to please when it comes to cooking and usually compliments my food, was uncharacteristically silent after every meal I prepared from this cookbook.  At the end of the first week I was left with a turkey ham that was on the shopping list but never showed up in any of the recipes.  The next week, I made a stew that was too watery to qualify as stew, but too lumpy to be soup.  It looked so unappetizing that I threw it out and made something else. After a few more weeks of bland, mediocre meals made from sometimes difficult-to-find ingredients that my kids wouldn't eat, I tossed the book aside and eventually dropped it off at the VOA with a load of donations. I was disappointed that I couldn't use Leanne's cookbook in the way it was promoted. It fell way short of my expectations, which were based on all the praise it got from so many people.           On the positive side, the concept of this cookbook is great.  I made a number of my own menus and shopping lists using recipes I found on the internet.  There are so many delicious, easy recipes on the internet...it's fantastic.  I am thankful to Leanne for the concept and for pushing healthy eating.  Obviously, she struck a chord with many families and is helping them eat better.  More power to them.   
 I was looking for a "do-it-all" player for music, voice and audiobooks. Although the iRiver T30 handles the first two functions pretty well, I advise you not to buy this unit for its support of Audible files. In this mode it works (sort of), but I have discovered several very annoying quirks.  As soon as I use the voice recording feature, the unit:  1) Will not save bookmarks in an Audible file.  2) Will not retain the last position in memory when I exit from an Audible file.  When this happens, the only solution I have found is to completely reformat the device and reinstall the operating system.  As well, when the unit's battery runs out in the middle of listening to an Audible file, the entire file is no longer recognized by the player. I must load a new copy of the file to continue. 
 This CD has three decent songs on it and that's pretty much all it has. Kut Klose didn't have a distinctive sound, so I knew that there wouldn't be a follow-up album. Most of the songs on "Surrender" are too slow and there's too much emphasis on sex.  "I Like" was the jam back in the day, but I'm sure that a lot of people have forgetten about the song as well as Kut Klose 
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself.

 Teri Hatcher fans can perhaps get some value for money.  But for her, and her ample body on ample display, this movie is just not worth the time.  Terrible direction, awful story, miserable music!! 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.  I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.  
 Terrible. I actually liked this band when I was extremely young. I'm glad I woke up and seen them and country music for what it really is.  These guys have too many cheesy type of ballads. Their dull and depressing 
 I have the 1995 British edition of this book - same cover, same authors, presumably the same text inside, but with the title "Postmodernism for Beginners". I think that title falls foul of the U.K's Trade Description Act, but so, I think, does the present one. I know a little about Postmodernism from a much better short book (Christopher Butler's "Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction", Oxford 2002), and I found particularly the first half of the Appignanesi book absolutely impenetrable. That first half, unlike Butler's, includes Structuralism in Postmodernism; but on Structuralism you would do much better to read John Sturrock's short "Structuralism" (Paladin), which is much more lucid and accessible, even if it doesn't have pictures in it! The second half of the Appignanesi book does at least have some suggestive ideas about the contemporary world.  
 This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this 
 GNR were a very overrated band. I found Appetite For Destruction very dull. This atleast has the band's 3 GREAT songs in November Rain, Civil War, and Live And Let Die. Get this for 3 great songs but stay away from GNRS OTHER CRAPPY SONGS AND ALBUMS!! THEY ARE NOT METAL! 
 I recently bought this book, and then promptly returned it. The opening line of the preface is an unclear, run-on sentence, which concerned me right from the start, and the book is generally overwritten, devoid of proper punctuation, and repetitive. As a result, I feel that using this book to teach writing might be like getting your cat to teach you how to swim.  My family did have fun suggesting alternative titles before settling on "Any Child Can Write As Well As Me Do" 
 I wanted to love this book.  I looked forward to reading it, and I found some value in it.  HOWEVER, after I finished I found myself staring at the cover photo, which is worth the proverbial thousand words.  A group of students, each gazing raptly at the author, who is in front of them, smiling outward.  Make no mistake--this book is about the Wonderfulness of Rafe Esquith.  To hear Esquith tell it, there's not much good about public education except his own work.  He has nothing but contempt for his most of his fellow teachers and he shows it in the nicknames he chooses for them:  Miss Mothballs, Miss Busy-as-a-Bee, Mr. Incompetent, Mr. Helpless, Miss Egghead, Miss Cruise Director.  Esquith is like our great-grandparents who walked five miles barefoot in the snow to school and back--uphill both ways!  There is no shortage of stories about how much he's sacrficed and how much he gives; there are even plenty of tales about how much he's been underappreciated.  Still, there are great gaps in his account.  He tells about the many extra jobs he's taken to provide money for his class projects, but it doesn't quite add up to all of the long and expensive trips he takes his students on.  I suspect that what's missing would make for some interesting reading.  I took away some important messages:  don't underestimate students' abilities, give them a sound context for the challenging literature one assigns them, let them know that it's necessary to work hard in order to excel, prepare them for field trips so they know how to act, what to expect, and how to get the most from the experience.  Expect excellence of one's students and of oneself.  I imagine that Esquith is a pretty good teacher (you need to read Charles Osgood's poem "Pretty Good," quoted in this book, to understand how faint my praise is).  This book, I'm afraid, irritates more than it inspires 
 I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. ("Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are "right-o, jolly-good" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK 
 I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters. After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings. The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right. Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record. For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' "Freak In" or the aforementioned E.S.T 
 The rhythms in this music are so monotonous, songs go on and on and on, with no direction, as if the songwriter didn't know how to end the song.  Very disappointed in this because an intelligent person recommended this album and I expected much much better.     Just a bunch of over-drugged and over-sexed punks, no role models here!    I don't recomend you buy this one.   
 I wish I never bought this phone!   Like some others mentioned; it was a huge waste. The landline connection works but it is very difficult to hear the other person on the line, sometimes it is very loud, sometimes you can't tell what he/she is saying. The volume controls are difficult to balance. The menus are very badly designed makes you feel like the phone is a kids toy or something. When dialing a number you will be faced with the number being pressed twice or sometimes it wont appear on the screen, this is because of the lousy design of the keypad.  I have hooked it up to my pc and at first it worked and the pc recognized it and it was ok, the second time I unhooked it and then retried connecting it and the pc didnt find it, I unloaded the software reloaded but nothing.  Believe me if you like using the yahoo voice features stick with a set of headsets and mic, if you want to get tacky maybe get some bluetooth gear, but this phone is not worth a cent.  
 The stars tell it all. The future is not happening for this book. But I don't want to be a shrew, so I'll just say, I don't like to be bored while reading and leave it at that 
 I ordered what I thought was a full size intro to yoga book and got the pee wee version for elves. I had been breathlessly waiting for my full size edition to arrive in the mail because I was so excited to be starting yoga. As I held the pitifully small thing in my hand I got so depressed because it reminded me of some bad relationships i've had in the past--big promises and nothing to back it up with. I binged on a quart of dulce de leche ice cream and a dozen black bottom cupcakes to try to numb my pain. These evil satanic deceivers must be stopped 
 This book is great for a first time owner looking to learn about parrots in general and specifically about african grey parrots. It devotes a nice introduction and touches on most toopics that are important in a manner that is easy to digest for the common human. However, I feel that the book falls short on several aspects, and I found myself wanting to know more after the last sentence in each section. I thought I would leave it as just a reference manual but the book in itself is poorly cross referenced and does not even have an index! As such, the book is merely a pamphlet or guide about african grey parrots. For the ~$20 that it costs you can find the same information in much less expensive books that actually have an index. Having some experience with other parrots and with other books, I find the book lacking and plain.   I guess the book will appeal to the non-science types and those who just want to have a generic guide of how parrots behave. For those of us that want to be our parrots best friend the book falls way short of its goal. 
 As a new bride, I thought this book was --well--let's say---BORING!. No style..no design and these authors are "lost" as far as what brides want in the 21st century. If you are young, hip and cool, this book is not for you. If you are old on a 4th marriage, you might like it. Also-warning ..these authors have TERRIBLE reviews on their Baby Bargains book. It seems they write all their own great reviews. I think Martha Stewart weddings is OBVIOUSLY much better and I also think I would not recommend a book from Denise and Alan Field's EVER 
 If Zell Miller wants to live in a dictatorship, he's free to want that, but he's crazy with hatred for a party that has no power.  What a noble guy!  Rage against the oppressed - what a man!  This book is insane.  I read it at the local library and wondered how he considers himself a conservative democrat when he supports a man who spends like a drunken sailor on shore leave (though the drunken sailor isn't a fighter, but more of a mascott pretending to be a fighter....) and bloats the Federal government beyond and Democrat's wildest dreams....  why so many in the GOP have let hatred be the guiding force i'm not sure.  I actually believe in God and the God in the Bible isn't the champion of hatred and vitriol.  
 this book is nowhere close to the exam.  if you're looking for practice exams similar to the california real estate sales/broker exams then look elsewhere.  
 There is not much to say about this book except that it is often extremely confusing for the layman. The examples skip steps, there is usually no explanation as to how to apply the theorems and one is often completely clueless as to how to do the exercises, or much guesswork must be done on how to apply the given formulas.  If you are already knowledgeable on the subject of numerical analysis this book might be a good reference for refreshing your memory but for the beginner it is for the most part going to be a frustrating waste of time 
 Ehhh... I'm just not real impressed with this one.  First of all - splitting the larger sun sign categories into subgroups is kinda nice, but also kinda vague.  It's essentially a re-working of the standard sun sign stereotypes, and if you're interested in astrology at all, you know them already.  Don't get me wrong - it's not *bad.*  There's no wrong information, it's passably accurate (for astrology.)  I can see how it would be very helpful for those on cusps, and even for the rest of us, it's occasionally got some new info (this book, for instance, is the first one to accurately point out some quieter aspects of my personality that go against the Aries norm.)  It's just not enough to get excited over, and most people will get the same level of accuracy or better by just going whole hog and getting a star chart done.  Secondly, and more irritatingly, the actual relationship pairings were astonishingly scattershot.  I think it would have been easier to deal with if they'd ALL just been laughably wrong, but no - after slogging through, say, 4 or 5 descriptions that could have been describing total strangers (because they certainly weren't describing me and my people), I'd hit upon something like "Confidential Projects," which was just a spot-on explanation of the vibe between me & my brother.  What do you do with a book like that?  (Also?  As has been noted by other reviewers, the book really is amazingly negative about almost every relationship pairing.  If I were to take it seriously, I'd be huddled in the corner now, wide-eyed, whimpering "nobody loves me and I have no real friends!"  Sheesh.)  It leads me to one of two conclusions: 1) it really is scattershot - they're just throwing it at a wall and seeing what sticks; or, 2) they're actually on to something, but haven't worked out all the kinks yet.  Which wouldn't be too bad, except that it's being published as a finished product, you know?  Final recommendation: pass.  If you're reading for entertainment, there are more entertaining astrology books out there; if you're a serious student, there are more thorough and accurate books.  If you've got money to burn and don't mind weeding through the stuff that's superfluous and the stuff that's just inaccurate to find the few true additions to this field that this book makes, it might make a decent addition to round out a library.  Just please don't be fooled into thinking this is the be-all and end-all of relationship astrology 
 I found this book to be disappointing. The reason may simply be because The Killer Angels is such a hard act to follow. 
 The Key to My Heart lipgloss chain is a very cute, original idea, but it fails to deliver the quality worthy of the Hard Candy name. The reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain, that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. All very true. I got my keychain in the Pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and I was feeling pretty cool about it. However, for me, the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it.   Now, I've always been a fairly careful person, I'm not klutzy nor do I drop or lose things. My keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be, I never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet, after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. The first time I was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition, the second time however, I only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because I saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo.   How did it come apart like this? I honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. I can honestly only chalk it up to really, really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. It was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. This is not the way to go for gloss on your keys 
 As a middle school 6th grade teacher, I experience the gamut of behavoir issues from too much chatting, to rudeness to the occasional pushing/fighting.  I found myself reverting to what this book suggests you don't do (but most teachers do) and that is to constantly say "Don't" and "because I said so".  While I control out of punishment and consequences, I was not feeling I was controlling out of respect.  I was searching for a book that could help me, and came across this one.  I liked the simple concepts. I liked the actual examples used of typical classroom issues.  This book made me "think" about how I am coming across to my kids now and how I SHOULD come across.  The only part of the book that left me wondering was 'how do teachers have time to implement this'.  I wish the author could have addressed that issue more 
 I can't believe this!  I remember at the begining of the 90s, people treated the 80s as a LLLOOOOOOOOONNNGGG time ago, I completely different era.  I was only 5 when the 90s started, but it still drove me mad in the 90s when people talked about how LLLLLOOONNNGG ago the 80s were.  Whenever people in the 90s said things like "Oh, that happened way back there in the 80s" I'd just get a confused look on my face!  It was just a few years ago people!  Now, what does this have to do with this game?  Well, people today are doing the exact same thing!  They treat the 90s as being way back there, even though we're just a few years removed from the 90s!  The news, music, and culture of the 90s are not way back in another time.  As far as I'm concerned, they still fall under the category of "current events" as opposed to the "ancient history" label people are starting to give them.  Its 2005 people!  The 90s aren't ancient yet 
 The book was fun but the fact that it is too long overshadowed all this fun. I got the impression it was rather written to become a movie. All I can say is that thanks to C.Bushnell for 'Sex and the City'. 
 With no disrespect to Mr. Bly intended or implied, I must say that in creating his "versions" of Kabir's poems, he has interpolated his own limited understanding of their meaning and in so doing, has trivialized  them. Kabir was no mere philosopher, whose work may be pulled apart and  analyzed, toyed with and rehashed with impunity. He was a Master, whose  words are chosen carefully to drive an important message home: "What  you are seeking is within you". Remarkably iconoclastic for his time,  he pulled no punches and made no excuses for his views on religion, ritual,  beliefs and superstitions. He unabashedly sings the glory of his own  experience and enthusiastically recommends it to one and all.  Even to  translate his words into another language is risky enough, although their  power has managed to shine through.  But to fabricate one's own  "versions" is to make the arrogant assumption that one is on the  same level as  Kabir, and thus able to diddle with the Master's words  without changing their value, import or meaning. I have always found  Kabir's songs both inspiring and challenging. Far from incomplete or  irrelevant to my time, they require no updating or commentary, but demand  that I become conscious and find the Truth within me, as he has done  himself.  I don't get the feeling he would ever muck with my poems; I don't  get the feeling he would appreciate my mucking with his. Mr. Bly has done a  service in exposing Kabir's work to the western mainstream, but not an  unqualified one, for in doing so, he has placed his own perception, like  sticky little fingerprints, all over it 
 You people really need to read before you assume that the occult is a bad thing. 
 I AM PRETTY EASY TO PLEASE WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES.LOW BUDGET,HIGH BUDGET,DOESN'T MATTER.THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY 45 YEARS OF VIEWING.WAS TOTALLY NOT BELIEVABLE AND THE WRITING AND DIRECTING WAS SHABBY AT BEST.DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED BUCKS ON THIS LEMON!!!! 
 Well, she's thorough, that's for sure.  Every possible sewing technique is covered here.  But with only line drawings for relief, it's kinda tedious to get through.  Maybe if you just wanted to look up particular techniques.  Her other books are great, but this one really leaves me cold 
 I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back.  It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out.  I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would.  Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes.  But, I would not waste the time if I were you 
 I have to disagree with the opinions of some of the reviews presented here and give this book two stars - mainly for its smooth narrative style and nothing more. Alex Marshall is not a professional in any urban field - he is a journalist. His take on the problems modern cities face is expressed shallowly. It is like a book on medicine written by a lawyer. Sure, he has some nice ideas but these seem childish views to me and more of a common sense matter - not really worth putting to print. In fact, it is so easy, simple and shallow I consider it a great exercise for your first speed reading class. 
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 Poorly researched, opinionated drivel that is liberally spiced with half-truths and falsehoods.  The book is a disappointment to anyone having real knowledge of the subject matter 
 Acting plot and everything is so bad that it made me cry... Dragonheart was breathtaking this is......B.S.. worst acting and story i ever saw in a movi 
 McMaster has taken upon himself the task of blaming the civilian leadership in the U.S. for the disaster in Vietnam.  How they misled and lied to the public and ignored the advice of the military.    That is true but his deliberate slanting of the evidence to prove his point damages what is a well-documented interesting book.  General Harkins comes off in this book as a man doing the right job but who was ignored by Lodge.  In fact, although he was ignored, Harkins clearly was pollyanish in saying things were going well when they weren't.  As the Bright Shining Lie makes clear, the countryside was falling to the Viet Cong during Diem's regieme (Harkins' time) and did not suddenly happen when Diem was overthrown as McMaster seems to indicate.    In addition, General Westmoreland continued the optimistic vein of Harkins.  He ignored the advice of his Marine commanders about sending Marines into the Khe San area and other areas the NVA and Viet Cong were strong and so suffered many losses.  Yet McMaster doesn't focus on the weakness and bad decisions of Westmoreland because the General.    The only  military member that McMaster severely criticizes is Taylor and that is because he "sold" out to McNamara. In point of fact, LeMay who comes off relatively well in this book was a nut whose preference was to bomb North Vietnam so much we could pave the entire country and then plant a victory flag.  Some victory if you kill all the people. The JCS was not united as McMaster does admit.    This book is well documented and covers a fascinating topic, the deliberate misleading of the American public in Vietname.  However, McMaster's failure to be objective dramatically weakens the book.   His criticism of McNamara and Johnson is well documented.  However, in his desire to prove his main thesis and, I suspect because of his loyalty the military, caused McMaster to gloss over the failure of the JCS and Harkins/Westmoreland, and to ignore the fact that rural Vietnam was largely lost long before Diem's overthrow.    Although not perfect, A Bright Shining Lie does a much better job of describing this sorry tale. 
 Let me just start by saying that I thought the first book was brilliant.  I really loved it.  I just couldn't get into this book though.  The main character was too whiny and depressing right from the start.  She irritated me so much that I stopped reading 
 I found this book rather...well...lame.  To me, and this is just me, the information was nothing that you could not find on most basic websites.  I would look elsewhere 
 I USUALLY LIKE REICH'S BOOKS BUT HIS ONE WAS A WASHOUT.  IS EVERYONE GETTING ON THE DIVINCI BANDWAGON?? DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FINISH IT 
 In "Dead Family Walking," De Vinci purports to give the reader the facts surrounding the events chronicled in Sr. Helen Prejean's controversial best seller, "Dead Man Walking."  He variously suggests and accuses Prejean of not only getting some of her facts wrong, but of purposely skewing, and even lying about these facts to suit her purposes.  Though Mr. de Vinci supplies many believable new details about the murders committed by the death row inmates counseled by Sr. Helen, everything he writes about "the nun" smacks more of character assassination than journalism.  To cite one example:  Sr. Helen managed to have one of her counselees buried in a Church cemetery site that had been reserved for a nun--something that raised the hackles of the parishioners.  De Vinci suggests that in order to arrange this, there was some wrong doing on the part of Prejean.  What evidence does he provide?  He quotes the caretaker of the cemetery who, after making it clear that he had little but contempt for Sr. Helen (without explaining why), said,  "I later learned from two nuns that Prejean went BEHIND Mother Superior's back and talked the sister in charge of the gravesites to sign the authorization for burial WITHOUT Mother Superior's knowledge. I was told Mother Superior was very upset Prejean secretly authorized the burial."  Any reputable journalist would have recognized this as being unusable--as being not only hearsay, but incredibly vague hearsay.  What two nuns?  What sister in charge?  Who told him about the mother superior being upset?  Why weren't these unidentified individuals looked for and interviewed?  To call this shoddy journalism would be giving the book too much credit.  At least as far as his "reporting" of Sr. Helen's activities are concerned, this travesty of journalistic integrity provides nothing more substantial than do the weekly rags proclaiming such wonders as "My Husband Was Eaten by Sub-Antarctic Moles," or "Bush a Direct Descendant of Muhammad."  Sadly, some will take this book at face value and come away thinking Sr. Helen to be an insensitive fame-monger--never recognizing this tome to be the illicit nonsense that it is.  
 Too many notes, too much whinning , and the intro to "Diamonds and Pearls" is very weak and very boring...I expected more from a talent such as Princ 
 I first thought that the book was pretty entertaining until the section on the Mining Hall of Fame.  I actually know about this museum in Leadville Co.  The author falsely alludes to the museum being a product of "big business" to promote their agenda.  This museum actually took many years of interested individuals' efforts to create.   The author seems to be upset because the museum doesn't tell the whole story about mining methods and their impact.  This museum was never intended to do that.  There are dozens upon dozens of mining museums across the country that does this.  The Mining Hall of Fame primarily focuses on notable people who have contributed to mining in the US.  Many of the inductees had not only a major impact on mining in the US, but also the world.  The author is critical because the type of people HE would like to see inducted in the museum are not represented, and alludes to racism.  He uses an example of a Native American "discovering" uranium in the 1950's in New Mexico, and asking why this person is not in the Hall of Fame.  Gee, could it be that uranium was actually discovered many years before?  After all, they did mine uranium in NM for the atomic bomb during the 1940's.  I did not finish the book because it was obvious that using actual facts were beyond the scope of this book.... 
 I usually give books the benefit of the doubt and stick with them even if I don't like the first few chapters.  I think I made it to page 30 on this one before I took it back to the library (so glad I didn't spend $ on this book!).    I just couldn't stand the name dropping and superficial characters.  Their lifestyle is just foreign to me and not something that appeals to me.  Maybe the book would have surprised me but I expect it followed a predictable formula.  Guess I'll never know but I really don't feel like I missed anything very special.  "Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman" or "The Good Wife Strikes Back" by Elizabeth Buchan are books of the same concept (I assume) and quite enjoyable.  Stick with them instead.   
 ...beware of bugs in the code. This is a good book for an intro to digital sound and sound file formats but the code (at least the stuff involving the windows multimedia API) is rather buggy. Hopefully the 2nd edition will be  better 
 The title lured me to purchase this book -- what I have found are a lot of stale exercises with some slight changes.  I have really found nothing that I can add to how I train GB, BB, and MBBs from this book.  Here are my 2 biggest observations:  Target audience -- appears that this was written for professional organizational teachers and not the MBBs that typically pitch the Six Sigma training.  Shared this with several of my peers (MBBs) and they quickly lost interest.  Too much effort appears to have been focused on the styling of the book rather than the substance of the exercises.    Timing -- quite a few of the exercises require way too much time to set up, conduct, and debrief. The return on this time really will not provide an illustration of the concept and application of the tools.  Looks like a couple of the data analysis exercises will require a large amount of time to enter the data provided, and then share this with the students 
    It's 2003, the war in Iraq has just begun, and a group of Hollywood players converge on the home of a movie producer for an unplanned and seemingly interminable week and a half.  The characters are somewhat interesting: there's Max (the producer) and his lover Elena; his daughter and her son; his ex-wife, the gorgeous and famous Zoe, along with her lover, the yoga practitioner/ guru; the agent who is trying to take Max in a `relevant' new direction; the childhood friend who is a big blowhard; Zoe's mother, who lives on Max's property despite the divorce; and the longtime neighbor.  We are treated to graphically detailed descriptions of sex, down to the anatomical, practically molecular nitty-gritty.  Each character also expounds on life, war, religion, George W. Bush, freedom, movies, blah blah blah.  Not one character really breaks out of a mold of self absorption; each one seems to simply want to stridently hold forth and impress the others.   	I know Smiley is attempting to model this book on Boccaccio's Decameron, and the characters do tell stories, mostly about their own lives, but when I reached a slightly more than halfway point in the book, I began to feel like Zoe's guru/lover, as he listens to her daughter `drone on':  "He sighed. They made him sigh. It was not precisely that they were boring, but more that they caused the expansion of time, so that every second, every moment, swelled to infinity.... It was as if he could remember every thought he had ever thought, and every one of them was futile."  That Smiley is aware of her character's limitations is obvious, and I `get' the satire implied.  This insider knowledge is not, however, enough to make me care.  
 I would love to give this a review, but since I can't seem to get you to send it to me I have no idea what this book is like. Needless to say, I'm disappointed with AMAZON 
 I picked up this book thinking it would be suspenseful and maybe interesting. This book was nothing but confusing and left me extremely frustrated at the end. I definately do NOT recommend this book 
 Pooh!  I can't believe I spent $15 on this video.  It is soooo BORING and miserably lacking in educational value.  My little girl wouldn't give it the time of day.  I had patience, though, and waited to see how it might redeem itself by creatively introducing letters and sounds to promote alphabet recognition and beginning phonics skills.  Disney should have hired a phonics instructor or a reading teacher to guide them in learning theory before promoting this movie as "educational."  Good for the Pooh collector, that's it.  
 i am a huge De Lint fan, but i cannot drag myself through Moonheart.  this is an early attempt by him to solidify his ideas about celtic and native american mythology and their presence in a modern setting, and for that perhaps it was groundbreaking at the time, but after his later books, this is painful to read.  the characters are largely flat, though the setting of tamson house is a good and intriguing one. the super secret paranormal branch of the canadian mounties (!) is never made believable or interesting and i kept losing track of the cops' names, which didn't matter as they kept dying anyway.  anytime he creates a character of a specific ethnicity, the cartoonish stereotyping and deeply labored ethnic dialogue are painful to behold (i.e., the "rasta" man who begins every sentence with "I and I"); the character of keiran with his constant declarations of "NOM DE TOUT!" and "LORD JUMPIN' JESUS!" is annoying beyond endurance -- and furthermore, what is he supposed to be, french canadian or southern gothic with those odd declarations?  the scenes with the native american "manitou" read like bad B westerns written by Carlos Castaneda.  do read De Lint, but don't start here.  his later books based in fictional Newford are his best, especially the books that are collected short stories -- they're wonderful.  if you want to read one of his early Ottawa-based books, read Jack of Kinrowan which combines two shorter novels into one and which is far, far better done.  i'd hate to have someone pick up Moonheart and think that's all there is to De Lint 
 Okay, this is the first book on the subject I bought... I found the instructions long and questionable.   I think if you want a good book, buy "Adventures Beyond the Body" by Buhlman.  Its much better 
 I thought this book was good but then all her others were too. I guess when you are a popular author the fear of failure may be so strong that you will stick to what works and what sells - the same alpha male and sassy female. Usually, I have no problems with this because given the same type of people in different situations and surroundings, they may develop differently or respond differently, but unfortunately, the surroundings are just masked differently but are actually the same. Now that is where the problem lies - its the same book with a different jacket and not the same characters within different situations (which I would be ok with). I think Laurens has become commercialized - too commercialized. When you grab a book and it feels like going to the supermarket and grabbing a brand of cereal - you know you are in trouble. Try Teresa Medeiros (love this woman), Elizabeth Thornton, Laura Lee Ghurke, Barbara Dan (newcomer) - you won't be disappointed. For some reason, Christina Dodd, Nora Roberts, Jennifer Blake, Virgina Henley, Stephanie Laurens, Lisa Kleypas, Cathy Maxwell, Connie Mason, Jo Beverly, Connie Brockway, and a few more I cannot remember seems to be very popular but for me, so hard to like any of their books. Does anyone else out there feel the same way 
 Don't buy this one by mistake, why they even released this one...i don't know.  It is a bilious condition that causes all hollywood movie scores to sound so blandly offensive, some more watered down classical tripe, from the john williams school of psuedo classical music, oh well, you still have Zooey to help keep you warm, buy the other one 
 I have read the other reviews with great interest.   N. J. Dawood's translation of the Qur'an is as close to being worthless as it is possible for an English translation of the Qur'an to be. The errors and mistranslations are such that many consider it to be perilously close to blasphemous. At best, it is absolutely impossible to get a clear understanding of what the Qur'an is really saying from Dawood's attempt to render the Qur'an into modern English.  He changed the traditional Sura order to the chronological Sura order (i.e. the Suras in the authentic Quran are not arranged in the order in which they were revealed). This indicative of his excessive license with the work, as well as his clear contempt for the original. An Iraqi Jew, Dawood excercises considerable self-aggrandizment with his claims that Jewish and Christian teachings influenced the Prophet. These and other liberties demontrate his unwillingness and incapacity to produce an accurate and unbiased translation.  His mistakes of translation are beyond ridiculous: e.g. 'bani Adam" (correct translatied as 'children of Adam'; from al-Araf 7:31) is rendered as "children of Allah". In Al-Baqarah 2:191 'al fitnatu asyaddu minal qatl ("oppression is worse than slaughter")' is mistranslated as 'idolatry is worse than carnage". Space does not permit me to list the dozens and dozens of other errors which would be amusing if applied to any other book.  As a Muslim, my disgust for his translation is so adamate that I refuse to permit a copy of it in my home.  Because if this, I have absolutely no animosity or ill feelings towards any of those who posted vitrolic invective about the Qur'an: simply because they never read the Qur'an. They read N. J. Dawood's worthless poetry; which, of course, cannot provide them with a shred of useful information with which to make an informed choice in the matter. I will not hold people's ignorance against them.  With all the sincerity at my command, I advise all, Muslim and non-Muslim alike to shun Dawood's translation as you need not mere diseased swine 
 this can opener is garbage.  it opened a couple of cans, then quit.  if you pushed it along, i could get it to open maybe half way around.  now i get nothing.  no matter how long you recharge the thing, it does nothing more than make a grinding noise and stops.  doesn't even start to open the can.  don't waste your money 
 I was shocked when I received these earrings.  They are quite small -- more for a child than an adult.  All in all, they are beautiful and my husband thought they were real!  The price is right 
 I am a huge Cary Grant fan. Or I guess I should say I was a huge fan of the onscreen persona that is suave and the epitome of class for me. This book will blow away the image you had of Cary in films, and not in the best-written way. Reading this, I felt like it was a 50/50 mix of hearsay and fact. Whichever half you choose to believe, good luck watching his movies with the same fantasy as before 
 I was very excited to get this book, but it has so much description of what amounts to torture of dogs in it, that I just can't read more of it and am actually ashamed to have it.    It was written by someone who doesn't seem to have any regard for the wellbeing of housepets and did horrible experiments on dogs for questionable gains.  I'm not a member of PETA and am generally thick-skinned, but this one gave me nightmares.    What they did to get the information isn't worth the outdated information the book contains 
 This book teaches children that dinosaurs were in the garden of eden.  Rediculous.  Why dont we teach our children science based FACT instead 
 The format of this novel is indeed innovative.  However, the words the characters purportedly write in their journals, or tell to the story's journalist, are contrived and not credible.  Also, some of the passages (such as the Sikh character's tale of the anti-Sikh pogroms in 1984 following the assassination of Indira Gandhi) seemed to be included not because they develop the story, but rather because the author thinks the reader ought to know the history in detail.  Is this book trying to be a novel, or a William Dalrymple wanna be?  It's like attending a presentation given by someone who is excited about his/her topic, but cannot seem to realize that what he/she knows and what the audience wants are quite different.  We can absorb history as part of a novel without being hit over the head and lectured about it 
 As a true beginner, I had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts in the book. It did not give nearly as many examples as were necessary nor was the presentation beginner friendly. I wouldn't recommend this book... unfortunately, I don't know of a good alternative 
 It took me a year to finally complete this book.  And honestly, the only reason I completed it was because I had nothing else on my bookshelf to read.  This book dragged on and on to the tiny climax about 5 pages from the end.  What a waste of such a beautiful book cover.  Do not waste a year of your life or a dime of your money 
 Even if you're a "conservative," you gotta admit that this is one of the worst magazines around. If you like good writing, don't even try this one. A "one star" is still too generous in my opinion. 
 This book was a big disappointment, starting with its awkward subtitle. At first reading it looks like "the one-thousand-nine-hundred-and fifty-five days of the Dodgers," as if the team had only lasted that long! "The Days of the 1955 Dodgers" would have been better.  But the big problem with this book isn't the title-- it's Maury Allen's slapdash and dull writing. Hard to believe this guy was a successful sportswriter for so many years. His prose is careless, rambling, repetitious, and lack-luster. There are even some spelling errors-- the kind of thing we've come to expect from 20- and 30-something sportswriters, but that you don't expect to find in a writer of Allen's generation.  What saves the book and makes it worth reading-- and the reason I gave it three stars rather than two-- are the many extensive quotations of surviving Dodger players from the 1955 team, and others associated with the team that season. Thanks to Allen's long-established credentials as a sportswriter, he was able to get "face time" with many former players and team officials who are difficult or impossible for others to interview. Ever try to set up an interview with Yogi Berra or Willie Mays?  As they say in Brooklyn, "Fuggeddaboudit!"  This is a pleasant enough read for Brooklyn Dodger lovers, but that wonderful team and that magical year deserve better than they get in this so-so volume 
 This book offers a very basic history of the gas companies.  The picures in the book are almost all from Tennessee.  I do not feel that the pictures choosen offer a fair representation of "vintage gas stations."  I believe that the book could have been much more appealing had the authors chosen to use pictures from all over the country.  They speak of stations located in California and the northeast yet there are very little pictures from either region.  Also most of the pictures in the book were taken in the 1950s and 60s, there are few older photos 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 If you look inside this book, you will find that the Bible's hyphenated names are not hyphenated, and there are no guides as to where to find these names in the Bible. Look in Strong's Concordance for them. What happened? This is nothing more than a nice-covered skeleton of a book. Will somebody PLEASE come out with a Bible Names Dictionary that has the information we need? This book is absolutely a waste of time and money 
 I am very enthusiastic about exposing my children to different cultures and ideas, and when I saw this book and read the reviews on Amazon, I was excited to get it for my girls.  When the book arrived, I read it immediately.  The story and the pictures are beautiful.  I liked everything until the very last sentence of the book -- I was very surprised to read that Yeh-Shen's stepmother and stepsister were "crushed to death in a shower of flying stones."  Although I understand that this may be part of the original story, I am giving this book one star because it is supposed to be appropriate for children 4-8.  I don't believe, with such a violent and disturbing ending, that it is appropriate for this age group 
 If your world is bounded by the borders of America then this guide will be just fine. It patronisingly relieves you of all decisions as to 'suitability' and completely ignores a wide genre of movies. As an example (I can give you more) try looking up the world-reknown Italian Director Tinto Brass. Maltin thinks he released only one movie - Caligula - and he doesn't rate that as worth watching! No, its not his best movie - but neither is it his only movie. Anything vaguely 'sexy' gets trashed and I wonder which monastry Maltin grew up in.  So if you want only the Mary Poppins and sugar sweet, and don't care about the wide range of movies from serious directors and producers abroad, then - go for it. But if you really want to know what is and has happened in the wide world of movies then don't waste your time or money on thi 
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 I love it when sci-fi takes old trite concepts and takes an alternative look at them. Battlestar Galactica for example.  "Dextra" tries this by starring a bureaucrat (Gloria VanDeen) instead of the usual trouble shooter, marine, navy officer, or secret agent.  Its hard to care about this though since Dextra is a crocodile nest of narcisstic competition. Rape and coercian are standard methods of control over subordinates and Gloria indulges just as much as any other Dextra bureaucrat. She herself is raped repeatedly and she dismisses this as part of the game. Employees working for Gloria are advised to use these stupid methods. You find yourself wondering why the Imperial government just doesn't nuke the Dextra offices to clean out this evil. It would certainly only help the Empire. None of this makes you like Gloria very much.  Beyond this Gloria VanDeen is a shallow character. She is a nympho whose sole ability is to wear tight revealing clothes and use any excuse to get out of them fast. It seems like 1/2 the book is just describing her latest wardrobe choice or lack of it.  In dealing with the Myn alien insurrection its pretty much the same story as at the Dextra offices. You really don't care about anybody in this book since its more about the sex than any other part of the story.  Now don't get me wrong. Sex and eroticism can be important and fascinating parts of a story. But do it wrong and it becomes a bad joke of a novel. Witness the later Anita Blake novels by Laurell Hamilton vs her earlier ones. That series has become a trainwreck due to its overindulgence in sex at the expense of telling a good story 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 I remember when this ran on ESPN2 during the week between Christmas & New Year's back in 2000. I'm a huge fan of the microgenre of football movies...but this one stays at the bottom of the barrel.   Pettine Sr. seems like a class act & worthy of the respect "local legend" high school football coaches deserve. His son, Pettine Jr, coaches at the rival school but lacks the charisma to make this documentary work.  Maybe the footage of him not seeming like a dolt didn't record right & thus we have no reason to root for him or his program at the finale. Rather than having a bittersweet moment at the ending after the dad plays the head-to-head season finale against the son, Pettine Jr seems kinda clueless giving the old guy a half-hearted handshake.  So much for paternal respect & love.  Had the potential to be great w/the setup. But don't let the glowing summary trick you...there's no emotional payoff to speak of for "The Last Game."  Football, after all, has driven grown men to tears on numerous occassions. Your time would be better spent watching Brian's Song, Rudy or the NBC series "Friday Night Lights." Even reruns of MTV's "Two-a-days" about Hoover of Alabama would be superior if you prefer the doc/reality TV style 
 I was prepared to like this book, especially after the rave reviews found here on Amazon, and Audible. But I found that Haunted Ground: A novel, quickly lost my interest. Why, you may ask? Because the author has too many characters and she head-hops between them constantly. Each section is narrated by a new character, and frankly I lost interest. I prefer books with one, possibly two voices but not a half dozen. This is particularly disconcerting in audio format. Plus, I found the drippy American character with the tortured past and murdered sister a bit trite and maudlin.   Feh, overall, 2 stars. If she had stuck to a single or maybe dual perspective it might've captured my interest 
 I saw the stage production and thought that since it was good the movie would be good also. I was very wrong. The movie is awfu 
 People have been trying for years to prove that the founding cause of the Universe is natural occuring harmonies. These theories are usually the occult disguising itself as science. If these theories are correct there needs to be a 'fundamental' frequency (a demiurge style 'god of harmony') to begin the resonance. No such thing exists - see Scientific American, August 2005 'Is the Universe Out of a Tune? 
 THIS IS THE WORST SONG I LISTED TO IN MY LIFE  IT SOUND LIKE A BANRE 
 The subject matter of this book is something that is of tremendous use in an elementary classroom. However, the text is choppy, and the subject hard to follow from one idea to the next.  Even the illustrations fail to  provide a common thread woven throughout the book.  The collage style  pictures are beautiful to look at, but confusing to tie together,  especially when paired with the choppy text 
 O'Leary made an honest effort to provide insights into the mechanics of apocalyptic reasoning. Moving from definitions of apocalypse and rhetoric, O'Leary extracted three basic topoi: time, evil, and authority.  By means of a case study of the Millerites and Hal Lindsey's writings, O'Leary gave  the three topoi a home in the tactics of persuasion of Miller and Lindsey.  Though the subject matter is a timely one, the book does not appear  accessible to everyone. This scholarly written book includes intense  philosophical and literary discussions and presumes one to be acquainted  with rhetoric.  However, for the scholar who can follow the flow of the  argument the application seems rather trite.  Yet for the layperson the  application seems of utter interest but the discussion of methodology and  the foundational presentation of apocalyptic reasoning seems beyond grasp 
 My stepdaughter got this book and brought it on our recent vacation.  It's an "okay" book to read on the beach, but don't expect any serious depth.  It nearly lost me halfway through.  Ms. Burana is a lovely wordsmith, but the overall story here is saccharine-sweet and not very interesting.  If you've got a "cowboy" thing, you might be more entertained than I was, but it read more like a tween book than anything to me.    
 Was initially impressed with the backrest; however, because the straps are not adjustable, it dosen't stay in place.  The one snap is not sufficient for holding the backrest in place 
 The top was very roughly finished. The end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place,because the seams on it were very rough, so I had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be. The top got COMPLETELY ruined on the first wash, I followed the instructions to a "T" during washing but still the blue on the top ran and I had to throw it away. The skirt is still fine after washing it twice but I would not recommend this outfit to anybody 
 The mount is unable to hold my 17 inch LCD without tilting.  I have followed the manufactures advise on how to prevent this from happening and it does not work.  After only 2 months I am now going to have to buy another TV mount.  Don't waiste your money on this product 
 Bruce Bawer, Daniel Pipes, Ibn Warraq, and others, have covered the important points with much greater skill and clarity.  And yes, there are important points: the threat of Islamist imperialism is real; the traditional Left's failure to grasp this has had catastrophic results; Eurotrash anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments are irrational and hypocritical; etc.  Beyond this, Berlinski is so pickled in Republican broth that she cannot stop undermining her own positions.  1. She complains of the urban sprawl and degraded environment of Europe, but wishes Europeans would breed faster. 2. She enjoys the freedom that European secularism gives her (as a secularist of Jewish parentage) but whines that more 'old tyme religion' is needed to counter Islamism. 3. She attributes Marseilles' (relative) freedom from Muslim mob violence to the inclusion of religious councils in city government. But must report the selection of a archetypal fundamentalist imam by the Marseille ummah.  The book appears to have been padded out to its current length, several later chapters are seriously below standard.  For one toothachingly tedious chapter, Berlinski appears to have skimmed Norman Cohn's great work The Pursuit of the Millennium. She manages to miss Cohn's central point--that Medieval Millennialist uprisings were specific to their time and do not support comparisons with Lenin, Luther etc.--and mines the book for examples of anti-clerical/anti-feudal revolutionaries so that she may compare them to a contemporary anti-globalization/anti-American French demagogue.  In addition, we must slog through an entire chapter on the German heavy-metal band Rammstein, so that Berlinski can point out that ... ya know ... Germans are, like ... different. 
 This gate is almost totally useless -- unless your doorways and walls are all /perfectly/ plumb and square AND happen to fit the arbitrary slots where the gate will allow you to engage the lock, that is...  
 If you are expecting the Disney's Mary Poppins, you are best making another reading selection.  Unfortunately, my expectations may have tainted my reading experience.  The book is filled with fun imaginative adventures children would enjoy.  However, Mary Poppins is stern and hard.  Her tightly guarded compassionate side does pop up during different events, but overall she treats the Bank's children with a harsh and sometimes demeaning hand 
 What a disappointment this is, after the superb Pitt and Monk detective novels set in Victorian times.  Someone at the publishing house should have had the courage to point out some problems to the writer:  (1) She repeats information not once but many times, apparently having forgotten that she had already said that; (2) The plot and denouement are not likely and are hard to follow.  For example, the police supposedly look everywhere for the gun that killed Sebastian, and eventually it is deduced that the one place they didn't look was in the drain funnel on the roof of the master's abode.  And lo, there it was, wrapped in a cloth and stuck, barrel down.  To prove(?) that it was the fatal gun, the cistern barrel for that downpipe is dry.  What?  Say that again?  In short, the characters, the dialogue, the atmosphere just don't measure up to the plunges the reader takes into the drawing rooms and rookeries of London, circa 1880+.  Rather than go into this series, the reader would do well to go back and read the Victorian books.  That's a sorry suggestion, and I'm sorry to have to make it. 
 Several years ago I was in a bookstore when I was about to purchase a general wicca book when a priestess approached me and recommended this book instead. It was very dry to me. I know it is to much ask to have it be entertaining, but at least it could have enlightened me! I only was able to read less then half way when I put it down. I picked up again after a few years and although I have grown and can understand the directness it became boring me to once again and very dry. I highly recommend as an alternative to this book any works written by Vivianne Crowley. Blessed be 
 I liked this workout the first time I bought it as her fatburning workout.  The second time I bought it re-packaged I thought it was a fluke. This time I bought this since it sounded more like weight training and less like circuit training, so it must be different.  Nope.  I have 5 Kathy Smith videos, all three with different titles and covers only three different contents. I feel this is highly unethical and contacted her company.  One month later and I have yet to receive a response.  
 Every time I hear that song "One Wish" it makes me want to throw up. I hope he never makes another CD 
 I had to order this twice because the first one would not work/load properly. The second one acted the "same" way! It is NOT my DVD Player. I have hundreds of DVD's and have NO problem with any of them except this one. What I "was" able to watch(the concert itself) was Excellent! Was not able to view "any" of the other extra/bounus tracks because I couldn't 
 I just had to add my review!....I want to make sure people know this toy is a piece of junk.  Nothing about this stays together!  I'm annoyed with putting it all back together.  It will soon go to never never toyland.  This is probably one of the worst toys my kids have ever gotten.  My daughter is 4 and she can't even get the toy to stay together. It's just ridiculous!  Meanwhile, my poor 2yr old son just cries because he wants lofty to go over the bridge but the bridge won't even stay up!....gggggrrrr  Oh and finally i put one star only because zero was not an option 
 I'm going to offer a point of view different from the rest. I think this book focusses almost exclusively on environmental issues, and practically equates "making a difference" to "saving the environment". Well, yes, there are remarks about "improving society", but no clear path to doing any of those things. (...) The book does not contain any lead into careers that address world poverty or undernourished children or any of the other burning issues that affect the world everyday, unlike a dwindling dolphin population. Not that I don't think that a dwindling dolphin population is an important issue, but it is less important than starving children groping through some rubble heap in search of food. In fact, unless that part of the "starving population" is reeled out of poverty, they will continue to have dire impact on the environment faster than any socially-responsible fund manager can write out "green" dividend checks. This book provides "first-world denizens" the distorted view that fixing environmental issues is all there is to it (and calls itself "The Expanded Guide"). This is most likely related to the author's own background and focus on environmental issues. But it doesn't measure up for me 
 I personally did not find this book too helpful at all.  I do think things happen for a reason and I thought this book would give you some kind of profound reason that you could walk away with and say "oh yeah" I get it now, but I did not get that from this book.  
 Dear Sean,  Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.  All my best,  Bill  PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced 
 Adam Sandler plays a painfully shy man who has extreme fits of violent anger and has to deal with 7 sisters constantly interferring with his life. He calls a phone sex line one evening and is then hounded by the man running the service. This takes place the same time he meets a woman who likes him despite his oddities.  The sad thing is I think there is probably a sweet, poignant love story in this film but it's buried in a morass of pointless scenes and a discordant soundtrack that is sometimes so loud it nearly drowns out the dialog. There is no reason shown why Emily Watson would fall in love with Sandler. It's really just one strange scene after another that in the end is dull and left me wishing I'd rented another movie. 
  had trouble finding  out how to put it together--- then the motor started and would not stop--- had trouble getting the bottom  in the right angle to stop it and then the slightest movement and it would go on again.  I would return it but it is too heavy to move--- heavy to move to make it change to mop part from brush part and making the motor stop was a formidable task.  I will let he battery run out and try it a few more times and try to use it just as a heavy mop.  that should not take too long 
 I had to cancle the order, because I keeped getting notes that it was on back order when I order it I was told it would be ship in 2 to 4 day 
 I consider large parts of this book as just a re-hash of earlier works by this author. If you know the earlier works, I am afraid there is not much added value for your money 
 I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful.  I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible.  I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci.  You can miss this one in my opinion 
 I picked this hoping to hear some good music but someone sent me their flotsam disguised as a CD. Someone told me that I would like Rascal Flatts. I think I'll ask this person if he's had a mental exam lately. Now if it's real rock and roll music, buy Rainbow's "Rising" or Black Sabbath's "Heaven and Hell" 
 not by a long shot.  this was given to me by one of my qigong students; one who hopes to become a master. this was my reply to him:  i read the first 31 pages, and it was clear that the book was not going to make a dramatic turn for the better any time soon. i won't be finishing deepak chopra.   the only thing i can conclude from what i read is that you just haven't been exposed to any serious spiritual teaching. his writing style and explanations border on comedy to me. i can see how they might touch someone who's never read anything of that nature before, but even then i would expect a critical person to sooner reject spirituality altogether rather than persue it after reading something like this. his words are empty rhetoric and his concepts are borrowed from true teachings and then stripped of their substance.  this book holds no credibility for me. and in my opinion, one could only "follow" what he says. he presents nothing to be considered. nothing to be understood. just gross generalizations, false causal relationships, and superficial advice.  i think his book is an insult to the philosophies and religions that he skimmed in order to write it 
 I bought this book because I was interested in using the Psalms with my work but I have to say I was a bit dissapointed. I did like the uses given and the suggestins of candle colors to burn with the Psalms but I did not like that the King James Bible was used for this book. The King James Bible is probably the worst translation out there. I decided to use the working related to each psalm in this book in conjunction with the Catholic Living Bible. The Catholic bible is far superior and much more powerfull for use as a conjure book. 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
   I don't really see why there is all this great furour over Angela Hewitt's playing.  All the faults of her other Bach recordings are on full display here: She has a way of focussing on a voice by making the others practically inaudible.  This works well for Couperin - and I greatly enjoy her recordings of Couperin - where the melodic line is more important, and other voices less important than in Bach.   However, in Bach's music, this kills the intricate weaving of voices that are its glory.  While her playing is quite refined, it is all veneer, and no substance 
 It does work well, but wasn't as low cut in the back as shown in the picture.  Also I found it to be very itchy around the top.  Would not buy another one 
 Based on various positive reviews, I was very eager to read this book.  I read it from cover to cover and I'm disappointed.  I completed the 40 day properity plan in February of this year. I took a leap of faith and followed the plan exactly by doing it over 40 consecutive days as the book requires.  It took two attempts before I was successful.  While I write this review seven months later, I have not received any financial blessings in my life.  The promises of abundance did not come to pass.  For the record, I am a Christian and believe in Jesus Christ as my savior.  I listen to religious programs on the radio and read the Bible from time to time.  Just because a book mentions God doesn't mean it's any good.  I should have known better 
 Within a month, I needed to contact the manufacturer for a replacement as the switch on it broke 
 Well, I'm an (unemployed)agronomist here in Brazil.I'll be sincere.I didn't read this book and I don't want to do this.In fact I read the reviewrs, and I realize how ridiculous believes this book claims to be true. As an agronomist, I must tell everyone in the world the fact that biodiesel won't never be a significant energy's source.And this happens, not (only) because biodiesel takes far more energy than it has in itself.This happens because, there's no fat in the world to produce enough biodiesel even to the american use. Every year american burns about 5 billions of oil's brents.About more than 2 acres of soilbean will produce 4 brents of biodiesel in an year.Even if 100% of agricultural land IN THE WORLD to be used to produce this biodiesel, there wasn't enough oil to the USA's consumption of oil. I'm not a moron about biodiesel. To replace oil from another source of energy, won't be easy, cheap or fast.It will take decades, not months. Has agriculture a hope for oil's economy? Yes, it has.But any hopes can come from biodiesel. The agricultural real hopes ares: 1-Ethanol + hydrogen + eletricity(for gaseification or hydrogenation). 2-Eletric gaseification + Fischer-Tropsch process. 3-Thermo-hydrogenation catalitical. Any of these ways, using LESS than Brazil's agricultural land available can replace 100% of oil, used in the world today. Shuck the Sheyks, but not with biodiesel's fakes.Biodiesel is a way to transform some wastes into an usable fuel, not the solution to oil's dependence of America or any other place.    
 It's not too difficult to understand how "Behold a Pale Horse" has become "the best selling underground book of all time"(according to a blurb on one pro-Cooper website)--after all, people want to(and do) believe in outlandish things. The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental "Tragedy and Hope".) To all the "if you can't handle the truth, don't read this book!" reviewers who know little to nothing about Bill Cooper: I invite you to do a Google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth, the real truth. Milton William Cooper was a certifiable headcase. Numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard-drinking, ill-tempered, violent man who was incredibly easy to fool. Cooper's contention that John F. Kennedy was killed by William Greer, the driver of his limo in Dallas, is of course well-known...but he also believed, and told audiences at his lectures, that the aliens on the Fox television show "Alien Nation" were real aliens. He wasn't kidding. Cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information, then take it--and repeat it!--as gospel. Fellow "fringe" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow.   I'll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper's death were suspicious. I feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end, and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to "Pale Horse". This was a human being with real feelings...but he was very, very disturbed. There are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally; so many that "Behold a Pale Horse" should NEVER become any conspiracy theorist's bible.     
 THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD, SO I BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. IF YOU LIKE RAP YOU'LL LIKE THIS CD, BUT IF YOU HATE IT, DON'T BOTHER 
 For those thinking about buying this book. One word of caution, it is NOT specifically about TWC. It is more about creating a business from the ground up and ignoring critics, blah, blah, blah. I was hoping for a behind-the-sences type of book on TWC, but this is not the case. A pretty dull book IMO, but a great book if you're a business person 
 We received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago (I was registered at Babies R Us).  My first child used it for a little over 2 years.  My second child has used it for nearly 2 years.  Neither child is big (in fact, one is rather petite). Even though the mattress was not abused, it cracked and ripped in numerous places.  I'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from Kolkraft.  I don't recommend this mattress. 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 I once banged my head on a VW motor while trying to figure out how to check the oil level. Therefore, I think all Volkswagons should be destroyed as a result of them being so dangerous.  So, I cannot recommend this book 
 A Thousand Days could hardly be classified as history and basically is an emotionally charged admiration of the 35th President. However, it is one of the classics that helped proliferate the Camelot myth that, unfortunately, continues to persist to this day 
 I received a 12-pc set of this glassware as a Christmas gift last year. Of the 12 pieces, we only have one of the large glasses and 4 tumblers left. These glasses break very easily, especially the taller glasses. I love the way they look but for durability, I wouldn't rate them very highly.   
 I was not pleased with these.  I bought mine at Target, and within one month the soles of both sandals were cracked.  No refund, since they were used. 
 This was my first Kay Arthur book.  I am comparing it to the impact Philip Yancey's and Max Lucado's books had on me.  I even listened 2-3 times through to make sure I wasn't missing something.  I gained no deeper  perspective of covenant with God, nor was I able to glean anything from the  tapes to make 'practical application' in my life.   Most disturbing was her  reference to Jesus Christ going to hell after the crucifixion.  This is  just not true.  Christ did not 'descend to Hell' to pay any 'debt' we owed.   It was all finished on the cross, thusly He proclaimed, "Father, into  thy hands I commit my spirit!".  Also, the gospel of John records  Jesus as saying, "It is finished".   I cannot recommend this  book 
 This book did not keep my interest.  I have read other books I borrowed from my local library that were more informative.  I would not recommend this book to any military wife facing deployment of a loved one 
 If you have really loved the other boleyn girl by the same author...then this book will be disappointing as it does not have the thrill factor like the other one did. This book failed to engage me and I had to put it down several times. The author must have done extensive research but emphasis is done more on the plants/garden than on the actual story. I Usually finish reading off an entire novel within 3-4 days but this one has been laying around for the last 3-4 weeks 
 I had the model before this one and it had great radio reception. I got this one and everything is fuzzy. I am going to return it but what a pain! You would think the reception would be good for Sony. 
 These pants did not look good on me.  They seem built for thin people.  While not obese, I am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me.  The material is nice, though 
 I guess I was expecting a Japanese, day before Pearl Harbor, Gorky Park. It wasn't. The problem with this book is that it did not hold my attention. I went back and reread more pages than in any book other than Michael Crichton's. In fact when I finished it I really could not tell you what it was about beyond ... the day before Pearl Harbor.  Buy it if you have insomnia 
 Once you get this remote working -- which I found challenging, and I work with computers all day long -- you'll definitely like how it works and it's better than programming in codes. The biggest problem is the charging dock doesn't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts, which means it's usually dead when I go to pick it up. I've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which BOTH of my 880s have, and they're not even answering. Last time I called, they said many people were having the same problem and all I had to do was squeeze a rolled-up piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection. That solution hasn't worked. They're on to something, but I'd wait for a version where they've addresed this issue 
 This was not what I expected, I love "food" movies like "Eat drink man woman", "Tortilla Soup", "Like Water for Chocolate",This movie was just a long boring trek through bad accents and poorly lit italian food, I realize that the food was supposed to be showcased here, but it didnt wet my appetite a bit, a can of chef boyardee looks more appetizing. I was glad the restaurant tanked, that louis prima didnt show up. The "big night" turned out to be a tiny blip of a movie 
 Madame Lenard's book is really quite a charmer, and it is her simple adventures that outweigh her rather amateurish writing. Regardless of the imperfections of the book, it is still delightful and interesting. She writes from her heart and you can feel her love for her village stretch from the pages. Some may find the author a bit pretentious and full of herself, but I dismiss that as just part of being French. (She is much more French than American, having been born and raised in France.) Enjoy this book for its content and the author's affections and just dismiss the lack of writing prowess 
 If you're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review.   That said, this DTS disc sounds terrible. Why?   1- If you're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs, you will hardly recognize them here. The multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix; in other words, they sound totally different from each other.   2- This disc doesn't have the fidelity of the SONY re-mastered Abraxas. The tape hiss is very noticeable, and the overall sound is very dull. Just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley.  Save your money and "maybe" someday SONY will release a multi-channel SACD from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd 
 He died for good on October 26, 2005, at Houston, a city he probably never saw in his actual life.  Nobody will remember him any more. He is dead. He will remain  forever as a Black Sock.  
 I realize that this "novel" was written as a companion to a video game, but if you're going to write something and put your name on it, it should be better than this. The "story" is that the Chinese have invaded some contested islands in the South China Sea. The U.S. gets involved and the Chinese declare war on the U.S. A submarine, the Cheyenne, is sent to the area. What follows are a dozen or so scenarios that a U.S submarine might encounter in this setup. However, there is no character development nor depth to the story. The American sub encounters a Chinese sub and sinks it. Then it encounters 2 subs and sinks them and so on and so on. This one American sub is destroying the entire Chinese navy single handedly. There is no suspense at all as the Cheyenne is never in any danger. Everything it does works, nothing the Chinese do matters. Their equipment is inferior, their submariners are inferior. This book is very repetitive with no suspense, no real plot and no believability. There is an overabundance of technical data about the submarines and their weapons which makes for very boring reading. I don't really know what the point of this book was 
 I received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. I was shocked, I order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this. 
 Alright first of all anyone that only mentions Satellite Years in their comparisons to this cd should sit down.  Second of all anyone that says "people don't like it because their is no screaming", you can also sit down.  The fact is A-Types does not even compare to any of their three previous releases in any way at all.  For those kids that think Satellite Years is their best cd, listen to Frailty of Words which is probably one of the best cds, if not the best in this genre.  This cd is perfection.  The tracks on that cd and some on Satellite Years have a perfect flow, whether there is screaming or singing.  A-Types on the other hand just gets flat out boring.  The singing on the cd is fine, but the guitarwork and drums just fail.  Don't get me wrong there still is some nice guitar work in tracks such as Breathe From a Coma which i do enjoy still, but if you compare any track from this cd to any old track, with or without vocals, it just doesn't compare.  Now the music is just typical and boring when before they could take you from the heaviest breakdown to the most mellow interlude.  They used to end songs with four minute interludes and you can just lose yourself in the beauty of how they are constructed.  Listen to End of an Era or The Far Pavillions.  If you don't enjoy screaming just keep listening to these songs until they get about halfway done and all of a sudden these interludes hit you.  Even in "Frailty of Words" they have many tracks that include singing such as "Endeavor".  This track is very heavy and then comes to a beautiful singing part that just blows you away.  They constructed songs to perfection, including everthing possible and constantly changed everything, whereas now you hear repeated chorus' and many repetitive riffs.  It is almost not even possible to compare this to anything that hopesfall has ever written.  I know that they lost their guitarist and only have one original member, but how can they possibly try to live on as the same band.  They have not matured, they have not sold out, they just have died.  This cd just goes on and bores beyond belief and I cannot bring myself to understand how people say that it gets better by listen.  The repetitive chorus' get worse everytime i hear them.  It is pathetic when you hear the same line in a song about 7 times.  "Woah Icarus temping fate again.."  How many times does it need to be said so that the fans can all sing along.  The old Hopesfall had no specific structure at all.  It was pure chaos and then pure calmness and then sometimes they would even bring you back into the chaos before they ended the song.  I enjoy when bands change styles or when bands have less screaming sometimes because i can appreciate that they are trying to move on as musicians, but once you get rid of originality that you once had, that's when you lose.  I wish i could feel good about their change, but the cd is just flat out boring and does not keep it's originality.  As one of the reviewers said before, if you want to hear a band that makes a great change and matures into a more rock type music listen to "In Response" by This Day Forward.  They got rid of almost all of the screaming and it still is original.  This is what Hopesfall seems to be trying to do, but they fail miserably.  I still love Hopesfall, as they are my favorite band and I believe that the songs on the first three cds are some of the best songs ever, but this cd just even without comparison to those cds, is just boring and unoriginal.  I just wish i could have seen them before they put out this cd, or even before they put out Satellite Years because their old stuff was so original.  I will give it two stars because "It Happens" and "Breathe From a Coma" are decent tracks that are not that boring but as for the rest of the cd i would not recommend it.  Check out "In Response", if you want to see a band progress you won't be dissapointed.  As for Trustkill it is ashame that they had such great bands and let it go to waste and now they are one of the worst labels.  And if you want to hear good Hopesfall purchase "No Wings To Speak Of" because it is the best cd ever made in this genre of music.  
 Tripe, its own self.   I've watched grass grow with more verve and enthusiasm. Disch is an author who was let in when the publishers opened the sci-fi floodgates in the mid-60s...and it shows. 
 I'm having a hard time doing this routine through because I can't follow the instructions very well. The camera angles change too quickly and in the middle of movements, so I can't keep oriented and figure out what I'm supposed to be doing. It's very frustrating. 
 This book could be used as an example of how to take an intrinsically exciting topic and grind it into the dust through furiously dull writing. Only the actions of the heroes themselves keep this book alive 
 This Russo collection of short stories didn't really work for me. I love his books like Straight Man and Nobody's Fool but I just couldn't get into this outing from him. It could very well not be Russo's fault, I tend to have issues with short stories in general 
 This book is an excellent example of talking down to children and treating them like they are little idiots, instead of intelligent beings who notice things and are trying to get the world figured out. Almost nothing I consider important about the given objects is what Ms. Brown considers important. I pity the poor children who believe it's imperative that apples be round. What, do apples make good wheels? Surely what's really important about apples is that they are food.   "The wind is important because it blows" is exactly the same as saying "The wind is important because it's wind." That says nothing. Tell the children why it is important that air move.   "A daisy is important because it is white." I can think of no reason why it is important that a flower of any kind be white. In my experience, we value flowers in general and daisies in particular because they are pretty. And of course, there's the whole "He loves me, he loves me not" thing, which makes daisies important because they have petals. Color just doesn't factor in.    And so on and so on. This list is complete baloney. Every time I remember that an apple is important because it's round I get pissed off.  It infuriates me that the author thought it's good to tell children this baloney, that the publisher published it, that the book is still in print, and that anyone would treat children as though they hadn't a brain in their heads.   
 One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun.  Quite the reverse.  He has cut it in half.  The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either.  Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half.  Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes  Even the plot is tissue-thin.  The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring.  Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction.  As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one.  He is capable of far better.  
 This book covers very little of the subject for which it is titled. If one were looking for a pure molecular biology textbook with some developmental correlations, then this is the text for you. It covers none of classical embryology and development. It is geared more towards laboratory technical work than to understanding fundamental principles. I had to give it only one star because of the misleading title. In reading this book, you will not learn the steps and stages of embryology and development. This text expects you to already know them like the back of your hand. You will not learn any developmental anatomy. You will learn a lot of seemingly arbitrary chemical signaling. Also, this text contains no glossary. I don't know what the author was thinking with that 
 But the primary problem with Against Method and other books by Feyerabend is that he's really nothing more than a critic.  He doesn't appear to be that creative (most of what he tries to say was already said 50 years ago in much healthier ways by people like Max Planck).  Still, as Marx once did, he acurately identifies many of the superstitions among today's mainstream elite (i.e. our knowledge workers), but at best he, like Marx, suggests only half-hearted, not really workable solutions. At worst, as with the communist manifesto, Feyerabend hints at horrible Freedom/Liberation Theologies (i.e., South American Jesuit Priests gone wild!) and political revolutions.  Anyway, I do appreciate Feyerabend's critical work, but from all his writing it's pretty clear that HE'S OFF in his own little world. And no matter what he says or even seems to believe about himself, he surely doesn't care about anyone but himself.  He's so akin to Bob Dylan, it's laughable.  Unlike Bob Dylan, his values and beliefs are probably a good match to those of his intended academic audience: selfish and silly.  In spirit, Feyerabend and his intended academic audience are just a bunch of Freedom Theologists/Lenin's/Stanlin's/Castro's/John R. Barry's who really just want to gain power by attacking instead of strengthening the Western World's fragile Pareto boundaries.   
 Seems to be a series of anecdotes by a husband and wife team who never actually tried a jury case in their lives.   "Social Scientists" and non-practitioners cannot really know the effects of jury consulting or voir dire, since social science studies are third-hand "pseudo-science guesses" at what really goes on, and whether justice is truly done.    A nice book for their resume, but that's about it 
 If I had seen this in the movies, I would have walked out and asked for a refund.  It was indescribably terrible.  I returned this DVD because I really, really didn't like what I saw 
 I firmly believe that Mr. Grisham should stick to fictional writing.  His attempt at Real Crime leaves so much to be desired.  Carlton Smith, Carlton Stowers, Diane Fanning and Keith Ablow do a much better job of Real Crime writing and in a lot less words and for a lot less money 
 Nazi's secretly in LA with a blimp and a whole army?  This guy has a jet pack that shoots fire out of it, but it never burns him; it burns other things though. Totally stupid and wierd. There is this super tall guy who is like soooo strong he bends people in half. Jetpacked Germans taking over USA. Give me a break. 
 This is required text for a graduate course I am taking, and I want to pull my hair out while being forced to read it. The political correctness in this book is overdone. One serious problem I had with this textbook was the way in which it seemed to start off on page 100 instead of page 1, because there is no introduction to Organizational Behavior. I don't know what to make of chapter 1...an HR manager's guide to political correctness on the job? The need to promote for diversity rather than for work performance? That is certainly what I got out of it. (Down with all white male CEOs!). It certainly doesn't introduce the diligent student to this subject. Sentences are long, drawn out, wordy. Concept paragraphs take a long time to come to the point.  I find myself daydreaming by the time I've read half a page and have to start over, and part of this problem is that every page includes at least one sidebar. On page 40 of this text, the author talks about Feng Shui and it's three C's of design: clean, clear, and comfort, followed by this question: "What about the chi in your work and personal spaces--are you taking best advantage of "good" chi?" I do not recommend this book either for personal growth or for use as a textbook 
 The focus of the book seems to be how to try every snake oil solution first, add in a lot of prayer and then seek help from qualified ABA therapists. It is informational and a good read - for what NOT to do. Try - 'Overcoming Autism' as your first book - Lynn Koegel and Claire LaZebnik. I give it two stars since it doesn't really educate how to approach autism so much as how NOT to approach autism 
 "South By Java Head" is the kind of book you might enjoy more if you just had a bitter breakup with your Japanese girlfriend.  The Japanese are the villains, of course, it being World War II and the protagonists a group of mixed civilians and English military personnel escaping Singapore a half-step ahead of Tojo's Army, but this 1958 effort by Alistair MacLean was written well before the advent of political correctness, and its racism is not only troubling but actually a detriment to the thin story.  Meet the lead villain, Col. Kiseki. As described by a Javanese villager, "Colonel Kiseki is not human. He is an animal, a jungle animal. But the jungle animals kill only when they have to. Kiseki would tear the arm off a man - or a little child - as a thoughtless child would pull the wings off a fly."  Later, we meet one of Col. Kiseki's grinning underlings, who assures us his prisoners will be tortured before they are killed because "the strong have no need" of international conventions. Special treatment will be dished out to the female nurses, he adds.  Yes, the Japanese often employed cruel tactics in World War II, but here instead of merely allowing them to be villains with the appropriate degree of intelligence and menace, MacLean turns them into savage brutes so bent on cruelty and killing that it literally causes their defeat. Meanwhile, the protagonists whose story we doggedly follow from one mess to the next seem done in or saved by odd spells of luck, both bad and good, rather than their own devises, about which little is clear in this convoluted narrative.  I only docked the book one star for racism; it's otherwise terrible enough. MacLean served up many cardboard characters and cheap plot twists in his career, but here, in only his third novel, and following the two classics "H.M.S. Ulysses" and "The Guns Of Navarone," he seems to be serving up a foretaste of his worst writing to come.  It's a shame because MacLean's plot idea is unique, a refugee ship trying to make safe landfall, and the opening chapter describing Singapore under siege just hours before the Japanese takeover is a good example of MacLean at his descriptive, Conradian best. But it all falls to pieces quickly as MacLean loads up his story with secret documents, double agents, traitors, and bad romantic subplots, not to mention so much pain and anguish as the party comes under repeated attack from the Japanese and the elements that you almost wish they would just capsize their craft and be done with it.  I love reading MacLean books, even the rockier later ones, because of his craft and his wit. But this was a painful read for me on many counts, and the hardest of his books to get through. Unless you're a completist (like me), give it a miss 
 I reluctantly give this book one star only because it provides some interesting information. Please be aware, though, that the author veers between sense and nonsense. Some of his explanations are intriguing, such as the source of the phrase "bobe mayse." However, at times he writes as though his comments are universally accepted facts rather than his own interpretation. I was extremely upset that he presumed to speak for anyone but himself and did not clarify that he was doing so.   The most egregious example concerns his comments about "goyim." He starts by referring to a "goyishe kop" which according to him means an idiot or simpleton, rather than someone who does not necessarily think the same way a Jew might (and why should a non-Jew think like a Jew, when their experiences may be vastly different?). He then writes, "On the great chain of Yiddish being, gentiles fall somewhere between Francis the Talking Mule and Bigfoot, and goy is almost always as much as to say uneducated, uncouth,uncircumcised--". In my opinion, this  inflammatory statement marks Wex himself as decidedly uncouth, although apparently educated and perhaps circumcised. I don't know why he chose to make statements like these, but he does NOT speak for anyone but himself. In the glossary he translates "goy" as "non-Jewish man" ("goye" being the female equivalent). I was astonished that he did not provide the literal translation, which is "nation." Look up, for example, Exodus 19:5, in which God tells Moses to tell the people of Israel: "Now therefore, if you will obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my own possession among all peoples... [6] and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation." The Hebrew for "nation" is "goy."   Further, in Exodus 34:10: "And he said, 'Behold, I seal a covenant. Before your entire people I will do marvels, such as have never been created in the entire world and among all the nations'..." -- the Hebrew for nations is "goyim."  So non-Jews are no more nor less than parts of goyim/nations, and Jews are part of a goy/nation called the Children of Israel. Therefore, a Jew is just as likely as a non-Jew to behave like an idiot; and since Jews have been charged by God to keep His covenant in order to be considered His people, it is perhaps less forgivable when a Jew behaves badly.   The author's comments in the next few pages about "shikses" are equally abhorrent, but I will aggravate myself no further with attempts at clarification. I hope readers understand that they should read this book with caution, if at all 
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 The only valuable (and non-redundant; i.e., not out there on the net) information I obtained from this book was the difference between an "active" and "easygoing" and a "shy" toddler.  Did not give me any insight into what to do now that my 20 month old is throwing tantrums, screeching (sometimes with joy, sometimes with anger), what to do about "flinging food", "fighting getting into the car seat", fighting getting his diaper changed ... - in other words - nothing about how I might guide his behavior.  I am still looking for a good parenting book that really tells it like it is 
 This book was not at all what I expected from Brands, who was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his biography of Benjamin Franklin, First American.  In trying to make an academic biography accessible to the reading public, Brands' writing suffers greatly and becomes far too colloquial.  At one point, when discussing Indian-White relations, he goes so far as to call the whites "Palefaces."  It was a chore to get through, and while it heightened my knowledge of Jackson, nothing was particularly memorable except what I already knew or, perhaps, the actions I disagreed with (his invasion of Florida or his use of martial law after the Battle of New Orleans).  Particularly when discussing Jackson's historically far reaching actions, such as kicking the Cherokees out of Georgia, or his battle with Biddle and eventual destruction of the Bank of the United States, Brands does a deplorable job of explaining what happened.  Elements of background, and why Jackson did whatever it was he did exactly, as the reader will be confused on that point, are conspicuously missing.  I have read similarly poor reviews of another biography by Brands, TR: The Last Romantic, and if First American is at all similar in style, I know why he didn't win that Pulitzer 
 Blech.  I hated this book.  I read a lot of "high drama" books about teen issues as I work with teens who find themselves in this genre.  Unlike Speak, or Crank, or even Cut, Smack is a book that doesn't connect with anyone.  Oh, and did I mention that it is boring?  Don't be misled by the other reviews, this insipid ride to unbelievable town doesn't belong on your bookshelf 
 The book started with a bang and ended with a whimper. It was tedious reading by and large, as the Park System is viewed by kind of the Willie Loman of Rangers. He also, as is common in this day, blames all the world's ills on America's and particularly George Bush's failure to get with the program and turn America into a socialist paradise. Like Cuba, I guess.   He spent twenty years with his co-workers, but has about as much insight, overt compassion, and intimacy with them as I have with the people I wait for the bus with. I'd really have to suggest skipping this depressing and needlessly politicized book; the ramblings of an embittered man. It reminded me of a poor-man's "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", only more pointless and far less well written 
 This book isn't witty, funny, amusing or enlightening. It's sick and sad. Don't buy it. 
 If you are reading these in order, this one is anticlimatic! you know that they are going to be together and the back story is horrible.  I really enjoyed the first 3, but the stories are becoming so much the same that I am giving up on this series!  I enjoyed sherrilyn kenyon's series so much more (which is also a little repetitve), but better written.  Christine really needed an editor to get rid of the same old statements over and over again AND to speed up the boo 
 Well, truth be told, I am a die hard Barbara Michaels fan (aka. Elizabeth Peters).  I exausted my Barbara books and decided to switch to one of her Elizabeth Peters novels.  Since I didn't want to get into a whole series like the Peabody series or what not, I picked this book.     What a let down!!!    OK, it kept my intrest and wasen't a total waste of time, but the story was predictable from the middle of the book.  Maybe even the beginning. Normaly when I read one of her books I feverishly tear through the last 20 pages or so.  Yeah, this one contained the quintessential explination and the "wrap up", but there was no basis to it.  I came to the last page and thought  THATS IT, you gotta be kidding me.  
 Well, this game... I mean, this movie is about... there are a group of... sorry. Don't waste your time. Nothing to see. Even my boy, after seen the movie, decided to put the game on the shelf, without finishing it 
 Whether you agree or not with Revel's views, and in large part I think I could be persuaded (by a more reasoned argument), his presentation carries the whiff of desperation that accompanies all ideologues and partisan hacks.  This book is no doubt very popular with people who already share its worldview. I came across it looking for a reasoned and reasonable presentation of viewpoints not necessarily my own. What I found instead was a book full of logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, straw men, and the worst of the rhetorical games that can be played.  If you want a cheerleader to get you pumping your fist in the air a la Rush Limbaugh or Al Franken or Michael Moore or Bill O'Reilly, then this book will be great for your enthusiasm, if not necessarily for your intellect.  If you're looking for a thoughtful exploration of the nature of America, her standing in the world, and the reflexivity of that relationship, look elsewhere. If you find it, please let me know, I'm still looking 
 Love the Dixie Chicks and love their music but this CD is a rip off.  Don't be fooled...it only has two songs on it and neither one is extended length.  Would have been an okay deal at $5 
 Sorry Folks but I found this movie excruciatingly painful to watch & extremely boring. 
 I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.  These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.  For the price, these can't be beat 
 I am stunned that a book like "Lightning" would sell even one copy.  Mine was given to me, but should have been tossed in the trash instead.  I cannot begin to talk about what is wrong with this book because there is nothing right. Worthless!!!!and pathetic and beyond.  For heaven sake if you are really of fan of Steel's (I find that hard to believe) than check it out of the library, do not waste a dime on this trash. "Lightning" discredits all women and is a sham.  It does not deserve even one star 
 All you die-hard Leon Uris fans (like myself) listen up!  This book is (almost, almost, almost) complete crap and I'm only saying that because Uris is one of my favorite writers and I believe that because of EXODUS and his other great works almost get him off the hook.   The story follows an Irish-American (who also, guess what? is Jewish) through his life and various loves--two women and the Marine Corps-- until he becomes president. The main character Quinn O'Connell is a combination of Guideon Zadok from MITLA PASS and O'Sullivan from ARMAGEDDON (throw in a little Andrei from MILA 18 and Rory from REDEMPTION; just for good measure) and there's you're protagonist. The book is the same type of narrative style from MITLA PASS-- non-linear timeframes and different first person narrators-- but it doesn't work the same way, it's horribly one-sided and sloppy.   Whoever edited this book deserves to be shot because of mistakes; a section will start in the first-person but switch, very abruptly, into the third person.  All in all, if you're a die-hard fan I would read it, it was his second last book and at least now I have some insight as to why O'HARA'S CHOICE was also terrible, his downard spiral. If nothing else you will be able to chart the progression and devolution of a great storyteller 
 I was expecting new and interesting ideas from this book, but was disappointed.  If you truly have no idea how to find a sales baseline for your business or don't know how to track trends, this book is for you.  If you are like me (you know the basics but were trying to find a more thorough approach), I wouldn't buy the book 
 As an After Effects instructor I'm always on the look-out for new tips and techniques. While this book provides information on some of the new features found in After Effects 6.5, there is little here that can't be culled from online sources and the product manuals. This book may be good for beginners but offers little for the Intermediate or Advanced user of the software. The authors need a proof reader, there are many typo's and ommisions, in fact the instructions in some sections are just plain incorrect. Screen shots are blurry and indecipherable, the production values are poor, looks like it was printed on a 300dpi laser. If you're looking for great After Effects training you can't go wrong with Trish and Chris Meyer's books 
 I bought this book based on the reviews that I read here and was very disappointed with it.  Coconut oil may be a good idea but the sketchy research in this book didn't convince me.  The recipes sound good but have many fancy, hard-to-find ingredients and are just too time-consuming to be practical.  I have only used one recipe from the book, as I found all the others to be impractical. Take the Thai Chicken Soup for example:  It has 16 different ingredients, 10 of which have to be chopped, sliced or bruised and many of which would be difficult to find and/or expensive such as lemongrass, galanga root, Thai fish sauce and Kaffir lime leaves.  Most regular grocery stores wouldn't even carry all those items.    The Phase I of the diet is a 21-Day Weight Loss Kickoff which consists of three meals per day and two snacks.  Some examples of the snacks are:   herbal tea and 6 macadamia nuts (no joke, thats all you get for that mid-morning snack) 12 raw or toasted almonds  1 celery stalk stuffed with goat cheese 3-4 sardines packed in mustard sauce  6 pecan halves  3 radishes and 4 green olives These are all individual snacks, not combined! If you normally eat like a bird, this might work for you but if you normally have a real snack, 6 macadamia nuts with sparkling water.  Phase II is a section on cleansing: first colon cleansing, then liver cleansing, gallbladder cleansing and finally kidney cleansing.  You may as well forget this phase if you don't have a juicer and all day to devote to the schedule.  For example for liver cleansing you would start your day like this: 7:00 or upon rising, drink 1 cup hot water with the juice of 1/4 lemon and a dash of cayenne pepper.  7:15 Beet juice cocktail (juice cucumber, carrots, a beet with greens, celery, ginger root and lemon).  8:00  any breakfast suggestion from the breakfast recipes and include raw food  take 1-2 capsules of the herb milk thistle or liver cleansing herbs  9:00 1-2 teaspoons Beet Salad (recipe on page 226)  10:30 ginger or echinacea tea  11:00 1-2 teaspons Beet Salad.  Sound like a lot of work?  And you are only up to 11:00!  It continues until 8:30 p.m.  Phase III is Introducing Healthy Carbs where you get to add a few more carbohydrates.  The meals are still a lot of work and the snacks are still tiny (you can have 6-10 macadamia nuts!)  Phase IV is Maintaining Your Healthy Weight.  More of the same but who could stick with it that long anyway?  Unless you love to spend the whole day in the kitchen and have a lot of time and money and have nothing better to do, you won't like this program.  Coconut oil may be worth a try but this book really isn't.  I like to eat healthy but this plan is rediculous 
 I have read over 30+ books on self development and this was another addition to my library. Title looked very promising so I bought this one.   Very well written and presented in recipe book format.  It tells you what is a 'Theory' and what you need to do.   Step 1 is the step and most important step for anyone is to clearing your mind from negative thoughts and that is a challenge.   It wants you to clear your house physically but what about clearing and suppressing your emotions and so clearing your mind.   It never worked for me as how can you cheat your mind and thing positively and greatly about little pains in your life like health issues or bills or recurring losses in business and still ignore the thought and let it go ?..  How can you let the thought of recurring financial loss go from your mind when you know you still have to pay that bill ??..    Part I wants you to get rid of those negative thoughts but hey.. let's face the reality.  Who is going to pay this bill?.  Who is going to suffer?.   It is hard to let go of thoughts and fool yourself when you are experiencing the pain every day, many times in a day, perhaps every moment.  Is that a Real You??...     I am not sure how genuine these reviews are or they are written by those who are just "fascinated by the thought that they found a great book", which works in (only ) theory but not in reality.   These principles never worked for me as if nothing works if Step I does not work.  Step I is basically 'Fool yourself and think Great, no matter what happens'  Great book but mostly impractical and it does not work .     
 I would have given this film 0 stars if possible.  This film was long, boring, and painful to watch.  If you like Jane Austen films or other BBC period films, do not be deceived by this one; it is nothing like those types of films 
 We would like to send this item back.  The construction was flimsy, and the assembly is very cumbersome.  One of the pieces broke when it was being assembled.  The item was inexpensive, but not worth the trouble to assemble 
 Much Ado About Nothing could possibly be the worst Shakespeare story of all time.  The words were so hard to pronounce and the dialogue between characters is so bad.  I have more intresting conversations with myself.  The whole plot was just stupid.  Don Pedro came home from war, and his brother Don Jon was plotting to overthrow him.  There were two couples in the story who sort of fell in love.  Benedick and Beatrice were sort of an older couple who showed their affection for each other in a "retarded" way.  They made fun of each other to hide the fact that they liked each other.  That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  What was Shakespeare smoking when he wrote this?  It's beyond me.  Anyway, Benedick and Beatrice end up falling in love.  This other couple, Hero and Claudio are sort of young and know that they like each other.  Don Jon has this idea to make Claudio hate Hero.  One night, Don Jon gets his boy to have sex with this other girl, Margret, and call her Hero so that Claudio will think it's her and deny her at the wedding the following day.  It works, but then the Friar convinces everyone that it was all just a plan by Don Jon.  So then Benedick tells Don Jon that his punishment will be determinded the following day and that's how this book ends.    Don't read it unless you want to experience the most boring 80 pages of your life.  I recommend this to no one, unless you're into really bad books 
 I've bought the book recently, because, though I did not know anything about the author, I imagined the publisher, Cambridge University Press, would not associate its name to something absolutely worthless. Unfortunately, that was the case, and since there is no lack of antisemitic literature, such a book does much more harm to the publisher's name than to the Jews. Cambridge University Press should be honest enough to recognize its mistake, disown the book, take it out of the market, and allow it to be published by the neonazis who love this kind of trash. Nevertheless there is a good side to the book: it is so badly written, boring, and each of its page betrays so clearly its author lack of anything that could even remotely be taken for intelligence that only readers who resemble him will be able to read it to the bitter end. Not even a self respecting antisemite would actually like it: at best this is reading stuff for the guy who takes care of the toillets in some cave in Afghanistan. This garbage is written for losers by a loser 
 I went through three lessons before canning this CD.  The lessons were terrible!  Sometimes they stated the French word before the English word and sometimes afterward, which meant you could be learning the wrong word!  The pronounciations were nowhere near the way the French speak; they were like what a HS French teacher who'd learned from a book and never been to France would speak 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 i would just like to say that diane's recipies are not my personal favorites but whatever that marielle woman has to say is probably untrue.  that was rude 
 I have been doing yoga for several yrs. Power yoga was a disappointment to me. Too much repetition of forward bending poses and seems like he has reduced yoga to a aerobic weight loss work out.  Don't waste your money 
 I've used the lonely planet guides on other trips before, and have always been very pleased, but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth.  LP was the only guide we purchased, based on our previous experiences with them, but we had the chance to peruse others in the B&B's we stayed in throughout our trip.  Of all of them, I'd rate the LP as the 2nd best for our interests - as they say, individual experiences may vary!  Ireland has become a very expen$ive tourist destination, so upon reflection, we would have been happier with the Rough Guide.  LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide, and has ended up short-changing all of them in the process.  I hate to say it, but I'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best.  I'd still put it above most of the other guidebooks though.  Our first and foremost gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are.  I realize it was published two years ago, but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20% more than LP listed.  That's quite a jump for 2 years, indicating to me either poor fact-checking for the 2003 edition, or some pretty crazy inflation and a need for another update.  Our second gripe was the local maps.  They failed to provide maps for a lot of the smaller cities, and only provided maps of the city-center areas in the larger ones.  Given the rarity of Irish street signage, those maps would have been a God-send for navigation in towns.  Also, and this may be a function of the 2003 printing, a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting one-way patterns in their city-centers, and LP's maps rarely identified this.    A third, again related gripe is with the existance, or lack thereof, of the various restaurants, b&b's, shops, etc. listed in the guide.  Probably 30% of the restaurants in the guide just aren't there any more.  I realize they must have been when it went to print, but that didn't help us any.  Our last gripe is the rather uneven coverage of large areas of the country.  Granted, it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - heavy coverage of larger cities and popular tourist areas along the coasts, pretty awful coverage of less touristed interior areas.  Unfortunately, we didn't just want to go where all the other tourists go, so this left our noses still further out of joint.  Overall, I'd say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well, both LP and Rough Guide do that.  If you want to keep the expenditures down, Rough Guide does it much better.  If you want to go all out, um, there's probably a third option, but neither of these two will do it well.  If you want to be thrifty in some areas and splurge in others, then this guide is the closest you'll get to filling your schizophrenic needs in one place - although, in that case, I'd really recommend getting two guides, one for each end of the spectrum.  One last piece of advice - buy a heritage card when you get to your first castle/tomb/historic place!  If you plan on visiting more than one or two historic places, its 20e cost will be recouped within days with all the free admissions it will get you for the rest of the trip 
 This has to be Stephen King's worst work adapted. This adaptation is even worse than Needful Things. Children Of The Corn (I am talking about the original and not the crappy sequels) was miles abouve better than this garbage. Just a stupid movie adapted from a lame book. Just plain trash 
 Such absurd statements such as, "Let us consider that you have $100,000, and that that amount is exactly what you require to fulfill your dream.  At the present interest rates, your money, in a very safe term deposit, will earn approximately $9,000 each year."  If this were true, no one would be investing in the economy and inflation would be out of control.  By "very safe", I think more like a savings account with 1% return. The book is also full of lists with no explanation of the items or terms 
 This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data--such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires.  On pp. 33-35, the author looks at success factors, and compares to the role of luck on pp. 82-85, which he downplays in favor of discipline. While he touches on the importance of having the right connections (and the genetic contributions to intelligence), on p. 85 he asks "what does luck have to do with graduating from medical school? What does luck have to do with successfully running a medical practice? Very little, according to these physicians." But what does luck have to do with being born into a family and in a country where one has a chance to reach adulthood, let alone be able to attend a medical school? Quite a bit.  Unlike its predecessor, which looked at prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs) vs. under-accumulators of wealth (UAWs), this book focuses on millionaires (PAWs) and decamillionaires (a tiny subset of PAWs, those with net worth $10M or greater). The lack of comparison to the general public serves to limit the book's value.  A misleading comparison between businessmen and stockbrokers on pp. 76ff makes the point. Stanley states that the former is an occupation more likely to have higher net worth. But this comparison is misleading because he's only looking at the millionaire-plus sample; he is excluding more of the total business owner population from his sample than stockbrokers. The average and median income and net worth for business owners are likely lower than for stockbrokers. If he made the same comparison with actors or musicians to stockbrokers, for example, the problem is more obvious--by excluding all those who aren't worth $1M or more up front, you exclude the vast majority, and pull up the average. With stockbrokers, on the other hand, a higher percentage of them are in the top income earners and wealthy.  On p. 110, after having pages about the importance of ethics and advising "Never lie. Never tell one lie." (p. 55), he passes right over his example, Mr. Warren, lying about being a college graduate in order to get a job, without comment, and without noticing the hypocrisy.  On pp. 173-174, the author wants to make the point that prayer is important for millionaires dealing with stress, despite the fact that the majority of his surveyed population do not regularly pray. (He repeats this again on p. 370, saying "nearly one-half of the millionaires (47 percent) engaged in prayer. ... for a significant percentage of millionaires, their religious faith is a major force in their lives.")  In trying to emphasize the point (p. 174), he splits his sample into "religious millionaires" (RM) and "other millionaires" (OM), observes that 75% of RM engage in prayer while only 8% of OM do, and points out that this is "a ratio of more than nine to one." This is a meaningless comparison, however--RM make up only 37% of his total population of millionaires, so his "more than nine to one" ratio is really nothing more than saying, of those millionaires who are religious, three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer (and 8% of those who do not consider themselves religious pray anyway). Since the OM population is much larger than the RM population, in absolute numbers that's not a nine-to-one ratio--his numbers show that about 28% of his total sample are RM who pray, while 5% of his total sample are OM who pray--closer to a six-to-one ratio.  But more importantly, the author glosses over the fact that not only are the majority of millionaires not religious, even a quarter of those who are don't engage in regular prayer! Given that the U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the world, the fact that such a low percentage of millionaires are religious is quite interesting and worthy of further exploration as to the cause, but for Stanley, religion and prayer are an important foundation of the "millionaire mind," and he completely misses the opportunity to find an explanation for why millionaires are so much less religious than the general population.  In a later table in the book on p. 366, he shows activities engaged in by a sample of 733 millionaires during the preceding 30 days. The table includes 52% attending religious services, 47% praying, 37% attending religious events, 22% Bible/devotional reading. These numbers don't quite match up with the RM/OM data from pp. 173-174, which seem to show even lower levels of religious activity, but these are still lower than they are for the nonmillionaire population--and weekly church attendance is notoriously over-reported in surveys. Work by Mark Chaves, C. Kirk Hardaway, and P.L. Marler in the 1990s found the actual percentage of attendance about half of what surveys show. This actually could mean that millionaires attend more often, if Stanley's survey results don't have similar over-reporting.  The author's religious bias further leads him to recommend to a student going through a divorce that she, despite not being a church attendee, search for a mate by joining a church group (p. 268) because she "believed in marriage and the traditional family concept." He writes that "I believe that one is likely to find better prospects in a church setting than in singles bars. Of course, there are no guarantees, but people with a religious orientation are more prone to respect the principles espoused in the Good Book." But why is he just guessing on this? Hasn't he asked his population of millionaires--the ones who are 63% non-religious--how they met their mates? He did this, very usefully, regarding how millionaires purchase their homes (pp. 315-326)--yet isn't picking a partner even more important?      This book has some interesting data, and is at its best when giving comparative results between populations (e.g., the house-purchasing characteristics of economically productive millionaires vs. non-economically productive millionaires in chapter 7). But it doesn't stand up well in comparison to The Millionaire Next Door, which is a much better book 
 My wife and I got two of these phones for "free" when she switched to Cingular. After two weeks, we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly. My phone was fine, but has lately been experiencing the same issues. I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas. Sometimes I'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back.  I do not recommend this phone. Even though it is/was free, it's not worth the frustration 
 I have to wonder if the folks who wrote the first reviews read the same text that I did!  This was my basic text for an intro. theology course I took at Princeton, where Dr. Migliore was teaching.  He is classically trained, very disiplined, and a real gentleman. But, as this book demonstrates, he can't be termed a great theologian. While he claims to be a Barthian, and he does use Barth's categories, he would not be recognized as such by Barth.  He might be described as more a "string of pearls" thinker -- he takes things he likes from a variety of contradictory sources, with no apparent anchor or controling principle. What you get is more of a "mood" than a tangible response to God's voice in Scripture.  This is a very weak, very inconsistent, very frustrating work. I hardly ever score things poorly on Amazon, but I had to comment on this when I saw the other glowing reviews. There are all kinds of good theology texts, both to the "left" and to the "right" of Migliore.  Louis Berkof, for example, is a classic that is clear and helpful 
 I bought this book mainly on the recommendations of other reviewers.  That was a mistake.  The book is a dull gleaning from unacknowledged secondary sources.  Lots of more or less accurate names and dates, but no depth analysis at all.  Style?  Try this: "The feeling that the arrests were a criminal act of unapralleled dimensions were felt at the time."  If you still want the book, don't buy it.  Let me know and I'll give you my copy 
 I was disappointed in this book.  The art and techniques illustrated are of the type one might expect to see on a TV Craft Show.   I would instead recomment Robert Wade's watercolor book.     
 After the hype on this book, I was extremely disappointed at how it rambled along with extraneous detail that never made a cohesive whole. I kept at it, hoping it would improve but alas, dear reader it does not. 
 I was there and this book is not accurate and does not represent what was going on in English Football at the time.  For excellent alternatives try Steaming-In, Hoolifan, 'Armed For The Match' or 'Congratulations you just met the ICF'.  It's a well written book, but as is documented in other books on the subject, he never had any contact with any of the top faces on the scene (why not read a book by one of them that are available), nor was he ever involved in any major incidents.  In the book he talks about people as if he knew them, but is relaying stories he was told by wannabes.  Likewise he tells a story of a Millwall fan attacking a West Ham fan based on a newspaper account as if he was there (a very poor thing to do in a book like this).  However it is well writen, and an interesting account from an outsider - just beware of the taking contents as fact 
 this one is useless to me.  It uses ingredients that I don't want to use - oxtails, for example.  There is a lot of text and pictures of the author's life, which I don't like in a cookbook.  This is for the experienced and daring southern cook, not the average southern mom looking for easy southern recipes.  Its probably great for some cooks - not for me 
 In "The Great Divergence", Kenneth Pomeranz presents an exhaustive investigation of the minutest differences and similarities in development of China and Western Europe. His claim, and stated objective, is to show that Europe's emergence as a preeminent power was the result of privileged access to overseas colonies, exploitation of non-Europeans, and a fortunate `geographic accident' of the location of coal in England. However, considering China's significant, and much earlier, developments in science, technology, and shipping, not to mention their huge deposits of coal, and its use some 600 years before the Europeans to make iron, it's difficult to understand Pomeranz's rationalization of those claims and ultimately the whole point of his book.  His specialty and interests clearly lie in China. In this book he attempts to shed a somewhat biased benevolent light on China by explaining the violent circumstances that led to the industrial revolution in Europe, and why it didn't happen in China. He presents a comparative analysis in such close, tortuous, detail that he becomes myopic in drawing his conclusions. His joy and skill clearly lie in analysis, rather than synthesis, and in the process, and among the ensuing debris, he loses a view of the whole as processes of nation building rather than competing sets of historical data. The outcome notwithstanding, he consistently paints each step in the process of growth in Europe and its colonies as a violent and ugly stepsister to a more sophisticated, benign version taking place in China. All of which may be true, but he discounts the effects of institutions, capital markets, capital accumulation, and regulatory competition in Europe as having marginal effect on the difference in outcome between the two areas because in his opinion what was happening in Europe was so similar to what was going on in China. He states that "European science, technology, and philosophical inclinations alone do not seem an adequate explanation, and alleged differences in economic institutions seem largely irrelevant".   Regulatory competition in Europe, for Pomeranz, equates to military competition. Although it could be argued from a more objective perspective that military research and development regularly spins off technological advances applicable in commercial areas, Pomeranz claims that in Europe `the net effect of warfare on technological innovation is likely to have been negative'. Clearly not true, but his argument about it possibly killing off other inventors was kind of funny. The development of institutions and property rights arising from this competition for him equals only the purchases of position, interference of guild control, and the granting monopoly privileges. He claims that all served to keep prices high, limit the extent of markets, and restrict output. The most positive function of `military' competition seen by Pomeranz is in the overseas projection of power. This lies in contrast to his claim that China was engaged in competitive trade with low margins, unprivileged by the state, that couldn't generate enough profits to finance a European style military capitalism. Here he ignores the Chinese obsession with intensive land use to feed its armies. The vast differences between the European states and the diversity of politics, social constructs, and institutions therein will show that had any single one of them been dominant the story of Europe, and the world, would have been very much different. Had the Chinese the benefit of this fracture, the voyages of Zheng He would have been continued, but when he died, the Confucians were regaining power and There was no political or spiritual will to continue. They felt that other nations had nothing to offer the already prosperous Chinese and they had no need to conquer their souls. Their voyages were ended, their fleets were dismantled and they turned inward. It became a crime to set sail from China in a multi-masted ship. This was their choice. One nation, one choice. Had there been competition among states in China, someone, somewhere would have chosen to continue.  As far as ethical systems and ideology are concerned, Pomeranz doesn't consider the consequences of differing motivation but only writes that philosophical inclinations do not seem an adequate explanation of divergent paths. Lost in analysis of the details of the similarities, here he misses the significance of the differences. Arguing that they were too small to create the large disparities in outcomes, he fails to ask whether those differences were what led to different choices. The differences in the ethical systems of Christian Western Europe and Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist China are enormous. The differences in the choices made within the context of those systems, especially within the protestant reformation and the creation of the Church of England, are significant. Pomeranz claims that ideology, or `philosophical inclinations', can't explain the different outcomes in the fortunes of China and Europe, but it was ideology and philosophy that led to the divergence in their development paths. Western Europe's history of fighting Muslims to keep them at bay and out of Europe established their crusading zeal to protect themselves by trying to convert everyone they could find. They embodied this fear and hegemonic drive and made Christian solipsism an imperative part of their culture. Vasco Da Gama said that the objectives of his voyages were "Christians and Spices". This dogmatic drive of the Europeans and their churches' implicit consent of their conquests and colonialism lent a higher power to their expansion. The Chinese chose not to continue their voyages. The Europeans were on a mission from God.  In this book, great tenaciousness in presenting historical data meets an astounding lack of insight into behavior and economics, and leaves the reader (at least me anyway) wondering why it was written in the first place. 
 This was a ridiculous documentary. I watched with an open mind, and after it was finished I was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view, it was ridiculous. Being that it is a Michael Moore movie I should have expected this but I tried to view it openly. Let me warn you now, don't waste 2 hours or 20 dollars 
 I had to read this book for school and it was really boring! I mean, who cares about him climbing mountains? I reccomend this book for boys and not girls. It's a confusing book also. Where are his friends? Blueboy can't talk! Alright, it was OK. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 In the first part of Palmer's book, I agreed whole heartedly with his observations and assessments regarding knowledge and the use we put that knowledge to at times, such as Oppenheimer's creating the nuclear bomb and claiming, "The physicists have known sin." Palmer astutely points out that we all have a tendency to "succumb to the arrogance that comes when we see what our minds can do," and that we desire to use our knowledge to control our environment. It is this desire to control that has put very deadly power into some unsteady hands. I would have to agree with Palmer on every point here.  Where Palmer loses me about chapter four is when he states, "Truth is personal" and truth can be found only in the relationships we have with one another. I suppose his definition of "truth" and mine are somewhat different, as I believe that truth is most definitely NOT personal - it is what it is, whether I like it or not. Now, what I BELIEVE to be truth and what actually is truth is always open for debate.  The rest of the book is structured around how to alter how we educate our students. While there are definitely some good points and benefits to what Palmer is suggesting, to make this the "fix all" for how to educate students seems a bit closed-minded in its own way. When you consider that everyone learns in a different way, and everyone responds differently to different teaching methods, I don't think there's one perfect "formula" for how to educate people 
 I couldn't even read half of this garbage before wanting to throw it away! Vicki Iovine tells a very negative story of Motherhood, and as a first time Mom to be, I couldn't be more nervous aobut it. Thank God I read many of the other reviews which claim this book is highly exaggerated. I am going to try to return the book tomorrow. Do not waste your time here unless you want to be depressed about Motherhood 
 This book is built around the idea "I wish it were true = it is true".  While this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives, if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life (i.e. intellectual integrity), you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability 
 For a movie like "Hellboy" where half the experience is spent trying to catch up, a novelization provides some opportunity to understand the parts that flew by. I hoped to learn more about why things were happening; instead, I was treated to a novelization in the most literal sense, where the author essentially described the images and recorded the dialog in the movie and didn't add one bit of back story. If you've seen the movie, don't bother with this book. If you haven't seen the movie, don't bother with this book. 
 My mother gave us our Rival F69204 Electric White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer, which worked well for three seasons.  Yesterday, I made a batch of frozen custard for company for dinner.  The result was terribly salty and had to be thrown out.  I filled the stainless steel container with water, which seeped out overnight.  Apparently ice cream salt bled into the custard mix while the ice cream was making.  Online, I discovered (1) that Mother paid much too much for this item and (2) there seemed no way to order replacement parts--as in a new tank.  Can you help 
 As with other books edited or affiliated with Jean Smith, there seems to be confusion as to how many days there are in the year.  This book says there's 365, while another of Smith's collections about Buddhism says there's 366.  In fact, both books only have 356 entries.  This type of glaringly obvious mistake is representative of the lack of depth and detailed consideration given to the content of this book.  I would look elsewhere for "wisdom" if I were you.  I wasted another fifteen bucks on this one 
 I like all of the other reviewers love the movie "Sparkle" and couldn't understand why the cast hadn't done the soundtrack...I think the whole idea of the soundtrack is to get an interpretation of the movie...by not having the cast do it - you don't get the same feel...Especialliy when Sister sings, "Giving Up" - while Lonette McKee didn't have the greatest voice the song did have significane in the movie - especially with her in the throws of addiction.  Giving Aretha the soundtrack just because she is the Queen of Soul was dumb....her voice was screamed over the movie 
 This book is pretty near worthless. I started reading it knowing that I was unlikely to agree with much of Vicki's "advice," but I thought it still might be funny. It wasn't. Also, lots of her advice is not only wrong it is *completely* wrong--as in, not only not backed up by evidence, but actually *contraindicated* by evidence. I could not even finish reading the book after I got to the complete drivel that was her "advice" on infant feeding--she presented the section as "common considerations when deciding to breastfeed" and then proceeded to describe the absolute worst-case-scenario for everything possibly related to breastfeeding (& several things that can't be blamed on breastfeeding at all!). It was a common considerations section, but would have been more aptly named, "reasons I think breastfeeding is awful and no one should do it" section.   I think it is valuable for women to read books that present a less-than-rosy view of motherhood, because too often we have a strong and persistent "perfect mother" image in our heads that is very difficult to live up to (especially if we have perfectionistic tendencies). I adore real-life, tell-it-like it is motherhood memoirs--they are validating and supportive. This book, however, is overwhelming negative and baby-bashing. There are much, much better books out there that do not worship motherhood, but do not completely despise it either 
 Generaly a weak book unless you have never used Excel.  I got the book because I needed help with graphical display of data. If that was your problem this book will not help you much.  
 Would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the Stewart Granger version of "King Solomons Mines". He is Alan Quartermain personified and Deborah Kerr is a more than credible female lead. All else is dross. And while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic "Prisoner Of Zenda". Stewart Granger like many of his contemporaries is under-represented in the DVD revolution. 
 Look, the fact is feminism is about CHOICE no more, no less. I have the highest respect for stay at home moms--it is the hardest darn job on Earth. But this woman is WAY off base to say that feminism sold us a lie. Feminism GAVE us a choice. It told us we did not HAVE to pretend to believe we were June Cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls.   Personally, I could not have children and ONLY feminists have not made me feel like an alien species. I work with troubled teens, my skills do not go to waste, I spoil my nieces and nephews--I am fulfilled and happy. My sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys, she is fulfilled and happy,FEMINISM gave us those choices, ladies.   We were not "sold" ANYTHING, we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us. IF you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world's most important job, I think that is YOUR issue and not NOW's. Stop blaming feminism for YOUR insecurities, if you are feminist--stop blaming your mother for your insecurities--you have choices BECAUSE of FEMINISM not despite it! 
 But 1 Star is the lowest one can choose.  I have never read a book with so much promise the first half, and so little delivery the second half.  It is hard to understand how a reader new to the Jury series could put up with the constant references to the plot of the previous Jury book.  Having read the previous book (heads above this one), I knew what was being referenced, but didn't really care.  Specific complaints: Cyril the cat in Racer's office is getting OLD OLD OLD. (Cyril disappeared "lickety-split" behind the desk--sounds like Dr. Seuss.) The intelligent, thinking, almost talking dog Mungo belongs in a Children's book, not in a mystery that started off so well.  ...  But finally, the worst part--the "plot", or lack of it. "The whole wild plot simply to get rid of a woman," Gault said (p. 275).  Sounded preposterous to him, does to me, too.  And the "plot", if there WAS one, is never explained, resolved, completed.  The book simply ends...Ms. Grimes had to go to the grocery store or something, so just quit "composing", and sent it off to the publishers.  I agree with other posters--no more actually buying any of her novels.  I'll check the next one out at the library to see if she recovers or not, but no more Cash to Grimes 
 The main reason to watch this flick is if you have a thing for gay male porno star of yesteryear, Tom Steele.  The leading guy looks just like him.  You see a lot less of this guy, if you catch my drift, but it's cute and watchable in a nostalgia kind of way if you remember seeing it on cable 20 years ago 
 Although this book covers come very useful areas of programming in Flex 2, the quality of the writing is so poor as to make it too tedious to recommend.  It's understandable that great programmers may not be the best at constructing sentences.  It's unforgivable that proof readers and editors let this sort of thing go to press.  Mind you that the example code seems pretty good (except for naming conventions mentioned below).  It's everything else that should have been properly proof read and corrected.  To be specific this book suffers from extremely poor punctuation, run-on sentences and poorly structured explanations.  So you might think "Why should I care?  I'm looking to learn Flex not enjoy a good novel."  Well, having to re-read  paragraphs multiple times (to try to understand what they mean) might convince you that this is a real problem.    Compiling a Flex 2 file with one extra curly bracket will throw an error.  As programmers we have to attend to this level of detail.  Why didn't the authors, proof readers, editors and publishers expect readers to read the TEXT to the same level of detail before they published this book?   As for the structure, maybe this is just a personal preference.  The authors walk the reader through each code line change - describing what to type and where to type it.  To me this feels as enjoyable as being told how to bake a cake ONE LETTER AT A TIME;  you've got to assemble the words in your head, then sentences, then organize it all into the proper steps to take.  Please just explain the idea, show the code and show the results.  Make it more visual instead of holding my hand through every keystroke.    Another complaint I have is that the Debugging chapter is at the very end of the book.  It would have saved me a lot of time earlier on if I had known that it's possible to view the details of all objects while debugging a file (just set break points and dig into the Variables area).    Yet one more complaint about the book is that it does not seem to follow any naming standards.  Coming from application development, where hundreds and sometimes thousands of fields are used, how variables are named is very important to me.  Does the world of Flex development have naming standards?  It's impossible to tell from this book.  Besides, when one is returning to a chapter to review details it wastes a lot of time when you have to also search to determine what "aItems" means for instance.  Would it really be so hard to name variables meaningfully?  Shouldn't the concept of egoless programming be an integral part of this book?  Sorry for the rant but I'm spending hours trying to slog through this poorly written book - the only complete one on Flex 2 at this point.  It's very frustrating.  Hopefully by the time you read this there will be other books to choose from.  In the mean time I'd suggest the Lynda.com Flex 2/ActionScript training and the Safari rough cut of Programming Flex 2 
 This title is the bootleg title for a film called the The Ratings Game. I'm no sure why Amazon is selling this on their web site. The quality of this DVD is terrible, I was suspicious when I got it. The DVD case and the DVD itself look like they were home made. Having said all this, knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it. It's like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time. I expected more of Danny DeVito.  
 The absurdly obvious title should be enough to tell you: this book is painful.  From the outset, the characters are all completely stock, thus assuming the reader already knows who they are, thereby releiving the author of developing them significantly.  In keeping with this bland characters, their problems seem to be little more than dopey whinning and fail to be anything more than annoying.  The plot is VERY predictable and I found I was just waiting for the expected outcomes to run their course: Devlin's self-absorbtion does him in, Max's inner goodness helps him adapt to the situation, Zeffy and Tia are set up to become big stars after overcoming self-doubt, the mother becomes more confident with the help of a new lover and the teenage daughter meanders through standard teenager problems before spontaniously deciding to grow up at the end.  Don't feel like I've blown the ending- its obvious from the get go.  I admit this is the only De Lint novel I've ever read, but I don't feel like reading another 
 This is by far, without a doubt, the single-handedly most God-awfully, hideously sterile, boring piece of literature ever produced by mankind. I have heard a rumor that hospitals are going to start making patients read this book in lieu of anaesthesia before conducting surgery 
 I read this because It was listed as a "great book". Why, I don't know. Maybe at the time it was risque. Imagine the horror! A wife, not happy with just being a wife! Soon she begins to realize that she is an indvidual who has her own sexual desires, so she trapses around town with men while her husband is away on business. It was a labor to read this, but I always finish. You however- I would not reccomend picking this up 
 I wanted some earbuds for my Zen player which fit in my ears and wouldn't fall out. These earbuds did fit my ears. However, a month after starting to use them one channel went out and now I have sound coming out of only one earbud. Also, I have no idea why these are called, "high quality" earbuds, unless it was a sales tactic. The sound quality is not as good as the sound of the original Zen earbuds. I am back to using the original buds, but I'm $20 lighter in the pocketbook. I was dissatisfied with this purchase 
 There were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself.  It focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling 
 I purchased this book and I want my money back. The book is clearly written, yet it repeats and repeats things which we all know and things the author keeps repeating in all his well-worn works.  Instead of 200-plus  pages, it could have been done in 20 
 I was doing the new change series and felt something wasn't right.Found out on the internet it's a cult all the way.This book is the mildest of all her teachings.Let me tell you if you don't do it her way you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.It's all so subtle when you sit there week after week and watch the dvd's it's all about her and her son and so subtle Remnant Fellowship the only called out ones.You'd better get in the arch or you are not the true followers of the Lord.Well Gwen we are saved by Grace through faith,it's a gift from God,not of works so no one can boast! That's all she does is boast how sinless or tries to be sinless she is and her perfect Remnant.I have been talking to several people that she has judge and judged hard and it makes me sick! Just look up on the internet type in Gwen Shamblin and you will judge for yourself what this Weighdown teaching is all about.Judge not least you be judge and why do you look at the speak in your brothers eye when all the time you have a log in your own eye?I never heard anything about God's Grace it's all twisted scripture.There's fruit all right in these peoples lives well other cults have fruit too! And the really overweight people if they are totally honest with you they starved themselves to get the rest of their weight off.JUST BEWARE!! 
 I was disappointed by this book.  It was not what I thought it was going to be.  I love NYPD Blue and I love Sipowicz.  I think Sipowicz is the most interesting, complex, and real character on television.  I found that many of the essays (the book is comprised of 16 essays on different themes in NYPD Blue) use Sipowicz and NYPD Blue merely as a launching pad to discuss more general topics.  For example one chapter starts off discussing Sipowicz's interaction with AA, but then turns into an essay on AA, not on Sipowicz or NYPD Blue.  There's not enough Sipowicz in this book for me.   
 cocorosie sucks.  They can't sing.  And they really piss me off using the N word in their Jesus Loves Me song.  
 Whole Foods recipes are not as healthy as they prescribe, nor that tasty.  We have tried several recipes from this book with hopes that we would find something that would satisfy us.  We never found any 
 How good was this book????  I don't even remember the story line.  I know I read the book and past it along to a friend, but it sure wasn't memoriable.  Sorry folks, your not going to get a rave from me 
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 I can't help but wonder where the proceeds of this book are going. Does this book help any of the 17 victims of dahmer or just line the pockets of a man who claims to be a man of God? This is simply another book of a long list of others where the author is exploiting his relatively brief contact with dahmer. While Ratcliff spares the reader the most gruesome details of dahmer's crimes it none-the-less adds insult to injury that Ratcliff is profiteering from the pain and misery of this monsters victims. One needs to remember that without these 17 victims Ratcliff has no book. So, again I ask, how is this book helping the victims of dahmers evil acts? While dahmer MAY be saved, and the very thought disgusts me personally, it is Ratcliff himself that needs to do some real soul searching on his motives for writing this perverse "book" and seek repentence for himself when he realizes he is nothing more than a profiteer 
 This book has a lot of useful info, probably more than 1st Aid, and the outline format organization is great to follow. So I think its best to either go with this book or 1st Aid. I recommend 1st Aid. It worked for me 
 I got this album after hearing "Some Kind of Zombie", "Underdog", "Lift", and "Worldwide".  Before getting "Bloom" I was a total AA junkie.  Then I heard "Bloom".  It shows that AudioA really matured after that, but still...  The only good song on this album is "Never Gonna Be As Big As Jesus", and even that's not as good as their more recent stuff.  The lyrics in this album are absolutely horrible and cliche, as though they couldn't think of anything creative to write (i.e.: "I'm not the king, I just sing"...ugh).  The music itself all sounds the same--they didn't bother to try to sound different on any of the songs like on more recent albums.  All in all, this is a poorly crafted album, with one good song and a funny throw away song ("Jazz Odyssey").  I heard that this was AA's best song--who was the dummy who said that?  I suggest you borrow it to hear "Never Gonna Be As Big As Jesus" but don't buy it.  I haven't heard anything before "Bloom" but everything they made after "Bloom" is 100% better.  Go get that.  And maybe try "The Swift" by The Swift and "Adoration" by Newsboys in addition to that.  In conclusion, "Bloom" is a failure to make a good album, overusing the music style and under-using creative lyrics 
 While some of the book is interesting it is more geared for the beginner in investing.  A lot of the issues brought up are nothing more than common sense.  I read it in a couple of days and felt let down by the simplistic approach to investing problems and the suggested solutions 
 The theme of this novel I believe is something around equality or injustice. But the author poorly displays the emotions and feelings, but the storyline about a poor painter who commits crimes weakens its affect. The life of a painter has little to do with injustice, and being deprived of splashing ink onto a canvas isn't a powerful topic, nor injustice in large quantities. If the story were something of higher stakes, the message would have been brought better. The works of Dalasquez have been forgotten in the snap of a finger. As stated before, the irrelavent topic of art is constantly replaced. Art is a fad, and I, Juan De Pareja is the tale of a painter being deprived of being part of a fad. If the author wants a tale of injustice involving fads, he could just capture the diary of a teenager 
 This production is misleadingly named.  Far from being a biography of Grand Duchess Anastasia, it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of Russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century's enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when, among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family, one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920's among at least some people who had had contact with the original family.  I do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography.  After all, how much of a biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege?  However, I do fault this production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history.  And I am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of Romanov history buffs about whether Anna Anderson was really Anastasia.  This work's take on the life of Anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the Romanovs, their support among their subjects, and their reputation among today's Russians.  First, life in the inner sanctum of Nicholas's family was not the halcyon existence this production claims.  Certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal.  But neither Nicholas nor Alexandra were well-suited to their roles, and they lived under the strain of it.  They were increasingly isolated from the extended Romanov clan, who shared the dawning awareness of the Russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble.  While these forces might not have touched Anastasia directly, she was certainly touched by her brother's hemophilia and her mother's response of sinking into frail health, chronic emotional distress, and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times.  Secondly, this film's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary White Army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong.  While the Whites wanted to unseat the Bolshevik revolution, there was virtually no support for a Romanov restoration among the leadership of the White Army.  Nor are there any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family.  In fact, one senior White military leader once remarked, "having seen the monarchy at close quarters, I have no desire to see its return."  And thirdly, while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last Romanov's reputation underway in Russia today, the notion that the murdered Romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims.  In fact, the great masses of modern Russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted Romanovs back on a throne.  I do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the Romanovs, whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the Russian monarchy's fading years, or whether this production did not have access to newly-opened archives.  But -- whatever the reason(s) -- it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is, in fact, closer to a grocery-store romance novel 
 i don't know why i keep giving clinique a chance.  i have extremely oily skin and this only made it oilier.  if you want a very expensive toner that keeps oil away, try clean & clear for oily skin. it's better and cheaper 
 This movie is a lot of fun, Parker Posey at her best, but don't buy it as it has been cut up for TVs. Wait for the widescreen version so you can see it as the filmmakers intended. Full-frame is an insult to moviegoers everywhere 
 I found the instructions obtuse at best. I'm a costumer and I bought this book to develop some original fabric techniques to add to the otherworld flavor of my costumes. But even with years of sewing experiance I had difficulty with this book.  I already know how to do about 1/3 of the techniques and even for those I found the explanations odd. I actully thought that the way she described would make some things harder to do. For instance she goes on about how to avoid having the bobbin threads break when making a large heavy gather. To deal with this I find it simpler to use fishing line or invisable thread in the bobbin. She recommend several other more difficult means, but never mentions this simple one.   Also she seems to go into too much detail on some things an almost none on others. Prehaps English is not the authors first language. THen again she seems to think that a mathmatical formula is worth 1000 words.   There are some interesting ideas that some one working on a flat surface like a quilt might find useful, but I don't quilt so I don't really know. I just got this book today and I'm going to list to sell on Amazon this afternoon, I wasted my $20, don't you waste yours 
 David Von Drehle had it right, the Triangle Fire is one of the great American tragedies and a great story. But Drehle takes an almost scientific approach to a story about people. Padding out the book to make it novel length (The appendix is nearly 1/3 of the page length) he so often repeats himself and circles back on the same information, over and over and over again.  Detail in such a tale is good, but Drehle is so caught up with just how many sewing machines are on each table he loses sight of WHY this story is so compelling.  The actual story of the fire is retold no less than nine times from nine different perspectives. And any time the book advances Drehle yanks it back to circle back on itself. Drehle might be a good archivist but he's a poor novelist.   I grew up on tales of the Triangle fire as my great grandfather was one of the men who went up to the roof to escape the fire and his stories were always rivetting...Drehle's aren't. DO NOT Recommend this book. It's a huge disappointment! 
 I picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.  I went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).  Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.  Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.  So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.  Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.  I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.  But you can guess how this ended up.  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  And I never finished the book since it was ruined.  But! I liked the parts I read "okay" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.  Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well.  Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you "keep on keepin on" like they say 
 Very Raw. Although similar to later Beth Hart,  the songwriting isn't as complex, nor do the songs jump at You and make You remember them. With the exception of "Blame the Moon" this effort is good, but obviously a freshman effort. Still a must have for BH fans 
 This novel is a travesty and should never have been published.  I am so sorry that any of my money went to a company, Coronet, that would render such a great author's work into a chopped up mess.  Read Whirlwind, it is great and essentially you will get two books for one if you believe that Escape is one unto itself ( I obviously don't).  I was expecting further elaboration upon the story line of Azadeh and Erikki but it is just each section that pertains to them chopped out of Whirlwind and put into a separate novel, butchers!  
 While some of the fundamental dietary changes that this book suggests are very helpful to many individuals to alleviate symptoms, the alkalizing diet is nothing more than a bandaid or a temporary fix.  In a healthy individual, the body is able to properly regulate pH itself.  Furthermore, there are many  diverse underlying causes and pathways to IC, and it is my belief that every patient requires individualized treatment.  My symptoms went from mild to unbearable after several months of following Amrit's standard regimen.  I urge you to proceed with caution.    
 This book could have been written by any party affiliate decrying the state of the media in favor for the other party.We all know about the use of statistics and anecdotal evidence and the authors hate-mongering against Conservatives leads little credibility to use of such devices. If you're a Democratic (or someone who writes reviews and says I'm a Conservative, but...) this book is going to help you account for the tremendous beatings you've taken in the polls and your increasing loss of popularity across the nation. If you're a Republican you're going to see it as another whine-and-moan fest of democrats trying to explain, once again, how they are victims.The author is a partisan who generates diviseness between parties so he can gin up book sales.  In both cases, you know exactly what you are getting 
 While this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot, the mistakes are inexcusable.  Many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data. Therefore, one begins to lose trust in the information presented.  Be careful if you use this book 
 If I wanted over 200 hundred pieces of inane advice on pregnancy, I'd ask my mother-in-law. 
 Nothing worse than taking a traditional Christmas song and messing it up by any genre.  I just heard Merry Texas Christmas, Y'all on the radio and I am about sick to my stomach.  Next thing we know someone will come out with a rap album called "Deck the Ho's" -- no difference than this 
 To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
 Read this book, and quite frankly was a waste of time. It really was not worth the paper it was written on. This author has proven to me to be a master of historical revisionism-a master spinner. So do not bother reading or buying this shmata 
 I know that it takes talent to make music, and I hate to criticize any musicians because I certainly couldn't do it, but this CD was just not that good. There are some cool beats, but they're pretty forgettable. Lyrics in electronic music aren't always deep or anything, but in some cases, I think she actually was trying to make a "real song", so it was kind of sad. Her vocals are Madonna-esque, without the smooth production. Maybe she just didn't quite live up to the hype. I'm beginning to think that most female djs "make it" just because of the novelty of female djs. There was nothing to HATE, but there certainly wasn't anything to love, either 
 Part of what makes Tori Amos so amazing is her obscure lyrics.  If you can't handle that, then you should LOVE Charlotte Martin.  Charlotte Martin seems more easily marketable.  Good for her, but Tori sells millions without seeming all that marketable.  Comparisons to Tori will probably kill Charlotte 
 This book, short and terse, takes a reproachful tone and minimalist explanation style. My biggest crticism, though, is its lack of challenging words. Those who have no trouble telling apart "incite" from "insight," "disparage" from "disparate," and "plum" from "plumb" aught to look elsewhere to satisfy their intellectual curiousities. I was wholly disappointed with this book, but very glad to have found a replacement for it called "The Bibliophile's Dictionary," which is in every way superior.  This book is a reference for the laity and, in my unintentionally high-brow opinion, should be skipped 
 An excelent reference book, however, sellers/buyers need to know a particular designer to find items.  Not all items are referenced.  Sellers/buyers need to do MUCH more research if they are looking for something special. 
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 Well, I like the song "I shall believe" and that's why I purchased this Album, but it would have been better to buy just the single 
 This work is nothing more than the attempt to make money off his fathers work.  It is sad that he would go to this length to captilize on the popularity of the Lord of the Rings.  Im greatly dissapointed.  His father was a good man, a good christian, and a great writer.  His son is none of the above 
 This book romanticizes mental illness in its quest to emulate Joycean prose. Dense, illogical monologues are unrelieved by dialogue, action, or time orientation. The effect is about as interesting as listening to  someone explain their dreams in detail.  Undisciplined, reads like a good  first draft.  Language is sloppy and cliched.  All it needs to be more  irritating is the addition of footnotes 
 I happen to be a big fan, but this is some of Bowie's weakest material. Why all the glowing reviews? There are so many other better albums Bowie did. BTWN is a dud 
 This is my first experience with The Mars Volta, and it doesn't leave me eager to check out their other work. Maybe I'm just not cut out for prog rock (though I do love Pink Floyd), because all this was to me was a bunch of endless songs (when are bands going to realize that making a song 12 minutes long for no discernible reason is pretentious, not groundbreaking?) composed of unmemorable guitar riffs, too much feedback, and unnecessary sound effects. Most of the 12 songs on this album, all of them 4-minutes plus, feel like the band took the opening riff to a potentially good rock song and stretched it out ad infinitum. It's possible that a second listen to this one will change my opinion on it, but it's never a good sign when you spend the majority of the album wishing it would end 
 Hey, I love the West Coast, as well as California (hope to live there one day). I believe that they can come with the most creative hip hop in the game, and try to support anything that they do. But you do not know how mad I am at this album! When I heard The Dogg Pound was comming with a new album, I couldn't wait to cop it, because comming from some veterans from the west coast (my favorites I might add), I had HIGH expectations from this. This was a very dissapointing album. I guess the flaws are right in my face.   I really don't want to accept the fact that the West Coast fell off, and I keep beliving that they're going to get back on their feet, but this keeps sending me a few steps backwards. Basically the spotlight reviewer "Constant" made the perfect statement about this album. This trio's rhymes skills have been kinda bad lately like on the song "Sittin On 23's". It's like each member tries to rhyme, and they do okay at some points, but fail most of the time. Songs like "Hard On A Hoe" & "Fake***hoes" are just horrible. The album name "Cali Iz Active" you'd think that they would bring as many west coast artists on this album, but they didn't. Lady Of Rage, RBX, Nate Dogg, and Ice Cube appear on this, but the fact that David Banner, P. Diddy, Pall Wall are on this damages the albums image. Also as many reviewers have stated, they're rhyme style hasn't really changed since 1992. Now thats a huge problem.  There are some good tracks on this here, and when I say "good", I mean they barely pass as listenable. I believe the self titled track "Cali Iz Active" was a good one as well as how they brought all the artists from the west in for the video shoot, as I hoped that it would be like that on the album. Although many of the beats are not west coast like, they are still a little nodding like "Keep It Gangsta" although Lady Of Rage outshines Kurupt and Daz. "It's All Hood" is one of those "good" songs on here (as I meantioned what I meant by "good").  Overall, this is not a good album. To me this is a HUGE dissapointment. I denied my self and kept believing that this is a good album, but as I heard it over and over again, it got worse and worse. If anyone remembers when the West was on top of the rap game, knows that this is not the way you bring it back. New listeners, who are unfamiliar of it's domination might like this album. I can't accept this at all.

 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 I was really hoping I would read stories about different woman struggling with alcohol. Instead each chapter has only a paragraph about a woman's struggle and then spends the rest of the chapter discussing and dissecting it. I have not been able to finish the last few chapters because I get too bored while I am reading it 
 This print server will not work with all kinds of common printers that you may have.  I bought the unit to unhook a particular printer from a PC that it's hooked up to and make it a shared printer.  The printer I wanted to hook up is required to be hooked up to a Windows PC to function.  This is apparently a common configuration for a printer where much of the smarts to run the printer are in the PC (especially for cheap ones which was the case with the printer with which I planned to use this print server).  Definately check out the Netgear support site to make sure that your printer will be compatible.  You may be better off to just buy a new printer that has an embedded wireless print server.  Printers keep getting more and more capabilities and the prices tend to drop as well.  The printer manufacturers make the real money of the ink cartridges 
 I thought this book was stupid and unrealistic. I don't really like the older BSC books...the newer ones with Abby are way better. If you want to read it, though, get it from the library...I wouldn't reccomend buying 
 I just took and passed the PM&R recertification exam, so I feel I am speaking with some authority regarding this book, which I used to take the exam.  First, for those of you that don't know, this year (results posted 2005) was the last offering of the "take-home" version of the recertification exam.  Therefore, for this exam, we were able to research questions before answering them. I used this Review by Cuccurullo and cross-referenced with standard texts-- Kimura, DeLisa, Braddom, Grabois, and DuMitru-- coupled with literature reviews, etc.  Unfortunately, I will have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  For a quick, concise overview, this isn't a bad quick reference.  But in trying to answer Board exam questions (which are for the most part surprisingly well-structured-- if you know a little about the subject, you can eliminate one or two answers, if you know more, you can eliminate another, and only if you are fairly well-versed can you be pretty sure you got the right answer) I found Cuccurullo insufficient to the task.  The information she provided lacked the detail to be certain of the answers.  Worse yet, I found significant information that conflicted with what other (more reliable) sources were saying.  Pretty scary.  The greatest utility of this book was organizational.  In one source, this was a synopsis of complicated information that allowed at least one to framework the data in order to try and answer the question.  Sorting through the differences and similarities of various rheumatological conditions, for example, or the similarities and differences between all the HSMNs, or various muscular dystrophies.  In fact, some of these Board exam questions seemed intentionally vague, so you not only needed to know the material, you needed to actually see it in front of you in order to be confident about your answer.  (Don't get me started on the Board's use of social-oriented questions... I'd give an example, but of course, that'd get me in trouble.)  The Board recertification test was not without its own other frustrations.  I found answers that were virtually quoted word for word from an old Kimura, for example, that newer texts (DuMitru, for example) differed with.  Unfortunately, none of the answers provided seemed any more definitive, so one was forced to make a decision-- was this simply an out-dated question, or one based on new data that I didn't have complete access to?)  Despite this, Cuccurullo's text seemed grossly insufficient to even go this far into the Board exam.  In a typical 5 answer multiple choice question, for example, this book enabled me to eliminate 2 or 3 answers.  Then I had to go and double check to make sure the information I got from it was not in error!  In fact, errors seemed so common, I wondered if it didn't add substantially to the time I spent taking this test, and if it didn't actually lower my score!  If you get this book, take it with a grain of salt-- use it as an organizational reference at best, and double-check the content 
 Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist.  He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution.   His retelling of the Divine Comedy, which appears to be based on earlier translations, is reasonably accurate and readable.  The problem comes with his notes.  They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive.  Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications.  This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as "that most heinous of sins".   And there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks. This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally of tune with Dante, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.  There are many superior translations out there.  Mandelbaum's is excellent and has good notes.  Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all.  What the Modern Library had in mind when commissioning this translation, which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry, remains a mystery. 
 Not surprisingly, the AFTER DARK FILMS are weak or average...The hype is silly.  If you want a movie "too scary or whatever for general audiences" may I suggest Henry:Portriat of a Serial Killer, heck, even American Psycho pulled more intensity than these films.  The Hamiltons was Ok at best, The feature was what it was, low budget horror, fine... love them... but, I failed to see what was so impressive, it looked, felt & unfolded by the standard formula, like thousands of others released all the time...I suggest a rental even for hard core horror feinds like myself before buying it...  Worth a watch if you see nothing else on the rental rack, nothing more...nothing less.. 
 This is a great idea, however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it, it won't work.  We don't have a sleigh style crib, but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch.  It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days 
 Dear God in Heaven . What a dreary little effort this is and what a disappointment after A Simple Plan . GReat idea for a very short story. Bad idea for a novel . In the end  ( if you can finish the tome ) you'll be rooting for the plant to do its darnest and quickly  
 Much is made of dyson's intellectual prowess; this just goes to show you that all things are relative. There are organisms shuffling down the street to whom dyson's intellect would, one assumes, seem impressive. But that don't necessarily make it so. You may, at some point, have heard the term pinhead. The term signifies that the owner of such a head has a tiny little brain, a "peabrain" if you will. This, in a nutshell, is dyson. He meanders around offering weak commentary and observation that appeals chiefly to the MTV and BET crowd. This is to say, he offers nothing of value other than allowing Penn to make their quota. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs 
 Although Anita Shreve is one of my favourite authors, I disliked "Eden Close" immensely.  The plot dragged on to the point it seemed the book would never end, and the characters were weak, boring and passive.  As I read the outline of the book, it left me with the feeling the book would be somewhat of a thriller but, alas, this was not to be.  The book could have been summed up in 50 pages or less.  We found out little about Eden until well into the book, and her friend, Andrew, seemed to be front and centre.  Shreve has many fine books on the market, particularly the Pilot's Wife, Strange Fits of Passion, etc.  "Eden Close" lacked emotion and purpose. This was Shreve's first novel, written in 1989; thankfully her writing skills have improved enormously since then. Skip this novel, read her more recent books 
 Of all the irrational political books on the market, this ranks among the worst. It's worse than Michael Moore as far as innacuracy and lack of evidence of mental strength. It would seem that Bowen has just enough functioning neural connection to write, gather random unverified stories and maintain a paranoid outlook, beyond that I guess he must at least have a functioning brain stem. Nearly everything in this book can (or has been) easily refuted. Nothing more than a middle school students efforts at critical thinking can refute his claims. The fact that idiots are out there buying this and believing it is both scary and disappointing. Nothing new I guess 
 This map  is a cruel $9 joke by Lonely Planet: central area only, major streets only, selected hotels only. Maps in their guidebook are superior, or simply use Google Earth 
 Read The Holy Quran before reading any propaganda books like this. Any book on Islam not written by a Islamic Scholar will be biased and racist. The wisdom of the Islamic Faith can only be understood by understanding the life of the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). The Hadith will guide you in understanding the true path for all mankind. Please do not buy propaganda books. Go to the sourse of all Islamic thought. Read the Koran and the Hadith and understand the truth without lies from American Press 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.  The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side 
 Brick's biggest hit, "Dazz" is spectacular in its long version, with its whistling/flute combo which I've never heard before or since in any musical genre.  You'd think it would naturally be included on the greatest hits album, since they are essentially a one hit wonder.  No such luck, as this compilation contains the short radio version of the song.  "Dusic" is the only other song which is halfway decent, but hardly warrants shelling out $10.  What a disappointment.. 
 In this book, Byron York only promises to present the evidence of a vast Left-Wing conspiracy - and that is all he presents.  The discussion here is limited to what left-leaning money has done. Primarily, this amounts to a muckraking castigation of George Soros for pointing out the fascistic tendencies inherent in Bush Administration policies and a denigration of Soros' concerns that the US is now, currently, moving in the same direction as NAZI Germany in the period between the World Wars.  There is no discussion here of any sort of moneyed conspiracy on the other side of the aisle:  no reference to the vast amounts of AmWay (DeVoss family) money available to smear Democrats and moderate Republicans; no reference to the vast amounts of  WalMart (Walton family) or Timkin (Timkin family) money available to do away with a justified and justifiable estate transference tax; and absolutely no reference to the extremely close, and extremely profitable, relationships between George Bush and Ken Lay (Enron) or between George Bush and Jack Abramoff (Republican corruption and treason) 
   As bad as this is, and as horrible as Anna is in this junk the man who co produced and stared as the bad guy is even worse. He stumbles on Shakespeare's prose and delivers the lines like he has rocks in his mouth and is in awe of the fact he can say them at all! Frankly, so am I. That said, this is a very funny movie about a bimbo pilot, bad guys in leather pants and some "do hickey" that will "change the balance of power" .... un ...yeah..... ok. The soft core nude sex scenes are more funny than hot and are the only time Anna is able to act. At least when Andy Sadris ("Guns , "Hard Ticket To Hawaii, "Savage Beach") made his movies like this fun and funny)on purpose, and the had many playmates not just one. All in all this is one to catch on h.b.o. after midnight 
 This book gives just a general overview of cat care.  It is good if you have never owned a cat before and need just general info.  I was disappointed because it didn't give many specifics on Persian cats 
 A great movie, about a great women, who inspired 4 men into their own greatness 
 I got this book because I enjoy good literature and the reviews were decent. I know some people say this writer is gifted, but I don't see it. I thought it was a pretentious, depressing piece of crap. The characters were full of self-loathing and the "bright ending" didn't redeem anything, not the main character or the book 
 I agree with the rest of the reviews.  I've read this series since its' inception, and enjoyed almost all of the books.  The sex has gotten stanger and more prevelant, but even through the last book it was still an adjunct to the plot.  This one however has nothing BUT sex.  No plot, no action.  If you took out all pages which contain sex you wouldn't have 5% of the book left 
 I found this book to be very depressing and dark.  The author kept saying how cancer will haunt you the rest of your life, little hope to escape it, you'll just have to live with it.  I've choosen differently, but this book was NOT helpful in my after treatment recovery 
 This book was a great book. I like the way Trent was helped by Nick. One thing I didn't like was the violence. I am not a big fan of basketball, or any other sport, but this book really touched me. I would recommend this book to anyone even if they aren't a lover of sports. That is what I thought about Night Hoops.      Sunny Block 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 With so many serious perspectives available on "peak oil", there is no reason to waste time on this screed, which only uses peak oil as a platform to cast aspersions on everything the author hates (and he hates, of course, all that which he does not understand).  He hates: the American south and its culture, Wal-Mart, interstates, strip malls, the Arab nations, and most of all, suburbs and the people who live in them. He loves: Israel, the liberal Northeast as it was fifty years ago, Israel, hateful rants, and Israel.  Peak oil lets him indulge in wishful thinking about how the Arab states will lose their power along with their oil, how the suburbs and Wal-Mart will collapse without cheap motoring, and the greatest reach of all: how the South and West will, for some reason, suffer more than the northern tier states in an energy scarce environment that he is certain is inevitable. Despite the fact that it is the northern tier states that are most dependent on cheap natural gas and heating oil, and have the least access to alternatives: solar, wind, biofuels. This last is thus little more than a transparent rationalization that allows him to imagine the reversal of the loss of economic and political clout of the north due to the inexorable flow of the American population from the dying Rust Belt cities to the more pleasant climes of the suburbs and the south.  Of course, he said all the same things before he ever heard of peak oil; back then he was making the same arguments about how Y2K was going to destroy all those things he despises. As were a lot of the other peak oilers.  Everywhere Kunstler goes, he sees only ugliness. This is to be expected. The ugliness lies within him, so he will never escape it.   Give this one a wide berth and learn something about Austrian economics. You'll be glad you did 
 This book is cute, and if you don't know how to speak spanish, but claim to teach it, this book is a great way to waste time cutting, pasting, and coloring.  However, thats about all this book is good for.  If you are serious about teaching/learning spanish, this book is not for you 
 I am very enthusiastic about exposing my children to different cultures and ideas, and when I saw this book and read the reviews on Amazon, I was excited to get it for my girls.  When the book arrived, I read it immediately.  The story and the pictures are beautiful.  I liked everything until the very last sentence of the book -- I was very surprised to read that Yeh-Shen's stepmother and stepsister were "crushed to death in a shower of flying stones."  Although I understand that this may be part of the original story, I am giving this book one star because it is supposed to be appropriate for children 4-8.  I don't believe, with such a violent and disturbing ending, that it is appropriate for this age group 
  Most of the time I get a good deal shopping for bargains on Amazon, but this wasn't one of those times.  The sheets were mediocre quality.  That would've been fine had they fit properly, but they were exceptionally baggy and the elastic was weak.  Waste of my money 
 The portrayal of the Bobo in this book, and, more importantly, the fascination and inner glee with which many will gobble up this portrayal, seem light-hearted and fun, but herein lies the reason that Dubya managed to win over the hearts and minds of good, average, working-class people everywhere. Shockingly similar to Brooks' depictions is the conversatives' and right-wing fundamentalists' portrayal of liberals and Democrats: as effete, latte-loving milquetoasts, who know little to nothing about the travails and tribulations of hard-working, ordinary folk. The resulting "cultural wars," based on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and separation of church and state, served as the perfect mask to the dark agenda that Bush and the right-wingers have planned: privatization of social security, revamping of the tax and bankruptcy codes to benefit large corporations and the ultra-wealthy, the destruction of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the list goes on and on.  Although I will admit to having enjoyed many of the anectodes in this book, it must be pointed out that they appeal only on the basest, most superficial level, and for this I am ashamed. Diverted by all the gadgets, toys, and conveniences of modern-day living, and the incessant feed of so-called ideas from a putatively liberal media, the Bobos and the primates who poke fun at them remain blissfully oblivious to the utter economic and environmental disaster that we're headed toward.  Instead of spending your money on this book, I recommend that you sit down, find some well-written blogs, and read some (free!) critical commentary on politics and the state of our country, and then try to formulate your own ideas about our society today; in other words, THINK for yourself 
 I spent the extra on this alarm because I wanted a projection feature.  The projection feature lasted 2 weeks.  I also had a wall clock made by LaCrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity.  Save your money, folks.  Hopefully, Amazon will refund my $$ 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 Read Andrea Makris' law suit at www.thesmokinggun.com all the dirty details are there, and should be required reading for anyone who reads O'Reilly or takes him seriously.

 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 This book was ok.  However it was the introduction of Togo.  This stupid dog was a total distraction to the mystery from here on in any book that the animal was in.  The book was boring throughout until the end when it actually got quite better.  It was not the worst of the set but ranks a bit below average 
 I'm a great fan of the avengers, but after seeing the Ultimate Avengers, I was hurt. I thought it was much too graphic for children. Furthermore the story resembles the pilot series of the "Justice League". I expected better from Marvel.  I guest it's just the signs of the times. I mean kids are so accustomed to seeing blood and gore in their video games, why not their cartoon series, right? No wonder, some have no qualms about pulling guns on peers and shooting them in the head.  I cannot in good conscience recommend this DVD to children. I would be doing a disservice to society 
 I bought the Zune around Christmas time of 2006. I used it on a daily basis and was happy with it. Early in April, it stopped working. After spending three (3) hours on the phone with four (4) technicians, Microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility. Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product. I did not abuse it in any way. Please think twice before buying this product. If and when it breaks - Microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a $300.00 paperweight. 
 The writer needs to go back to being just a housewife! This book is SO BORING! Must have been copied from other books or website, not much detail, just enough to start getting interested, then it leaves you hanging. If you are having trouble falling asleep, don't take a sleeping pill, just start reading this book! It will make you so drowsey you will have problems staying awake 
 I found this book horribly written. For any amazing president who helped to mold our nation, this author certainly did not portray Madison this way. I've read a number of books about other historical figure that all managed to capture the time and person, but this one did not. The only people who will probably pore over this book with slight interest will be the students that have assigned for class 
 I had a watch like this from Pulsar years ago and it worked well. This one I am returning to Amazon because it can't keep time and the calender keeps resetting to Jan 1. It was made in China so what can I expect. I am deeply disappointed in this product. No more Pulsars for m 
 Some people are born writers; others, natural stylists. Some people come into the world with the enviable ability to philosophize; others are blessed with a no less enviable gift to think through an idea logically and clearly. Which puts G. W. S. Trow in an awkward position: for though he could not write well, he yet fancies himself a great stylist; and though his critical thinking is at best muddle-headed and derivative, he yet imagines himself an oracular critic of the sharpest distinction. Reading this re-publication of Trow's throw-away essay instantly brought to mind that immortal phrase Dwight Macdonald used to lampoon Jimmy Gould Cozzens's prose style: malphony exfoliates 
 Mouse movement is extremely slow. It literally takes 10 (!) seconds to get from one side of the screen to another (800x600). I just got it from OfficeDepot [...].  Buttons are too small and hard to control. Joystick is unresponsive 
 Every since Bill Maher made his sympathetic comments with regard for the cowardly terrorists who caused so much pain for this country on 9/11, I've had no use or interest in his musings whatever they may be. I encourage anyone who considers purchasing anything that will benefit him to consider this 
 I heard about this book through a women's book club and noted the 5-star ranking on these reviews.  Once I got into the book, I was surprised by the very graphic account of an assault against one of the female characters.  Though the event itself was crucial to the plot, I thought the horrific detail was gratuitous, as well as highly upsetting, and I would think twice before recommending this book to another woman.  The story was engaging and kept me reading, but I was disappointed by the lack of depth in the two main female characters.  They "rise above" profoundly disturbing experiences rather than confronting them head on, and the ending of the novel is too "neat."  
 The title of the book and the description sounds great but I need to see the table of contents before I can actually purchase it. 
 An interesting but implausible tale to say the least. The author writes about the existence of stone "platforms" on Cape Breton Island (CBI) that he stumbled across a few years back. Curious, he tries to track down the builders of said platforms with the usual suspects being the French and the English. Going through the existing historical record reveals nothing about who the builders could be.  He then makes the jump to the idea that it must have been Chinese explorers/settlers who did the work during the heyday of Ming China's voyages of discovery. (I suspect that those voyages were more about tribute gathering and trade than about discovery.) Anyone familiar with Menzies' book 1421 will know his theory of how the Chinese sent expeditions circling around the globe yet mysteriously somehow missing Europe(!).  I'm extremely skeptical about Chiasson's theory that it was the Chinese who built the platforms for a couple of reasons. First of all, there is very little reason that I could see as to why anyone would want to build a settlement on Cape Breton Island unless there was something very valuable there. As Chiasson says, there is coal and there is gold. Unfortunately for the theory, China has lots of coal so it would not be economically viable to transport it all the way back to China from CBI and the gold deposits were not enough to sustain later European ventures. Again, China has closer sources of gold at hand and, even if they were to send out fleets of gold miners, there are closer sources along the way to CBI such as South Africa, West Africa, and Central America.  Second, Chiasson's talk of the Chinese using the Gulf Stream to mosey on up the Eastern Seaboard sounds plausible but he also fails to mention that this same current will eventually land you in Ireland and Scotland too!  There are also a couple of other bothersome points I'd like to bring up. First, Breton does not refer to the English but to the region of Brittany in France. And, second, the pictures of the Minority Peoples of China that he uses to posit a possible link between China and the local Micmac (sp) tribe is laughable. It's implausible to suppose that such people would be on board important Han Chinese voyages in sufficient numbers to make a cultural difference in a tribe thousands of miles away!  Like I said, interesting but implausible. I suspect that only actual archaeological digs will dispel the mystery of the platforms, if any 
 The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the "I", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her "great destiny" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative. 
 Oh. My. God. If you've ever wanted to read a book written by someone who is ungrateful and whines and thinks they are better than everyone else, this is YOUR BOOK!!!  This book is so long and drawn out and has NO POINT.  The author had absolutely no reason to write this book, other than to vent their ungratefulness on the rest of us. It breaks down like this: Polish family flees to Canada to escape the Nazis. They start out rough but end up doing quite well. WHERE'S THE STORY!?  The "author" goes on and on and on about how boring things are and describes her self-superiority over everyone else with paragraph after paragraph of just boring descriptions.  It's no fun to read.  She had it VERY WELL growing up in Canada - her family was safe and ended up making a good living there - WHAT'S THE PROBLEM!?  The author has an attitude problem - rather than try to make do in her new envrironment, she just whines and whines about it CONSTANTLY. At least her little sister tries to blend in. This one just cries about it and seems to think she can see more or understand more than everyone else around her.  News flash: YA CAN'T.  You are just like everyone else honey.  You should be grateful for all your parents did for you instead of fighting it every step of the way. Don't read this book. It's boring 
 This book is very much oriented around following a certain structure. Syd focuses on describing the three act structure and how to build your screenplay in this structure. While structure definitely is a valuable element, I would not recommend anybody concentrating on it too much, cause the right structure will come in the right way for your script. Much more important elements like how to create rich characters and to enhance your story are not dealt with very much. If creative advice is given it comes across in a quite rigid way, and is lacking foundation. You really feel that Syd didn't gain his knowledge by working as a professional screenwriter, but just by analyzing them. I am missing that kind of sensitivity, creativity and flexibility in his messages to writers that would come from persons who have really written screenplays themselves. To sum it up: The book was not valuable for me, in fact it left me disappointed and a bit frustrated. Other screenwriting books on the contrary have been a very inspiring and motivating source 
 I usually love books full of suggestions of other books to read, but this one was really just a massive list of books arranged into somewhat random categories. It was impossible to tell from what she said which of the books I would actually enjoy reading. (Amazon lists and reader reviews are much more helpful.) Also, from those of the books she recommended that I had read, her taste is too all-inclusive for me. She seems to love everything, a lot of which I don't think is very good 
 There were so many things wrong with Tim Burton's take on Planet of the Apes.  Weak screenplay, bad casting, very little substance to it.  The same was with the score.  Danny Elfman tried to put the brass and the woodstring themes into something that tried to echo Jerry Goldsmith's brillent score for the 1968 film, regretfully the finished music sounds so uneven with themes and melodies that do not convey the sense of wonder and fear that the Goldsmith score has.  In the end, you sort of wish that both the remake and the music score had never been done at all 
 I'm an avid reader of history, as well as processing a degree in the subject.  So imagine my surprise when, after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas, I read the erroneous account of the Children's Crusade of 1212.  I had done research on this topic, so I was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred.  Had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years?  If he had, he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly French people led by Stephen of Cloyes who, when told to turn back by King Philip II, did so.  That ended that crusade.  The other one, led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas, led a group across the Alps into Italy.  Some left for home while others continued on to Rome.  It's interesting to note that in Rome, many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these "children" were either too old or because they were pregnant.  Perhaps until relatively recently, people believed in the Children's Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles (like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred, rather than relying on more contemporary sources.  Nor did they realize that the latin word "pueri" used in the chronicles can have several meanings (such as unmarried men rather than  children).   In the final analysis, you just can't rely on books like these to really teach you history.  The best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it.  If only the author had bothered to check the History Channel's own account of the Children's Crusade on their website, or perhaps read the excellent paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History, or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia.  The book gave two pages to this event, and sadly got it completely wrong.  For this gross oversight, I am compelled to give it one star.  Readers of history, never just believe what you read - verify 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 This book is rather sad. The non-scientist author, like his hero Velikovsky, just doesn't understand many of the technical issues he writes about. Velikosky was so obviously wrong that very few scientists tried to refute him. Carl Sagan was one of the few who took on this task, primarily as lead speaker at the AAAS Symposium held in 1974 to discuss Velikovsky's ideas. Sagan pointed out a dozen or so of the major contraditions in Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision; he wrote up his remarks for publication in the book that came out of the Symposium, Scientists Confront Velikovsky (Don Goldsmith, editor), and reprinted it as a chapter in one of his own books. That was it. Sagan's paper was hardly a definitive analysis of Velikovsky, and he never corrected it to make the arguments tighter. This book seems to claim that Sagan spent a great deal of time dealing with Velikovsky, and even that he used the AAAS symposium as a springboard to fame. That is simply wrong. Velikovsky may have obsessed about Sagan, but Sagan had far more important things on his mind than Velikovsky. Nor did this excursion into the realm of pseudoscience do anything to advance Sagan's career. In that sense, this book is devoted to a non-issue. 
 The pleasure of Plato is as much from his literary as from his philosophical acumen. The choice of the public-domain Jowett translation is unhappy for bringing out the literary merit of the original. This Victorian prose, while usually competent as translation, does not ring true to the original and certainly does nothing for the late 20th century American ear. One wonders why the set is so expensive when the translation was had for nothing. And why doesn't Amazon print the contents of these cassettes in their bibliographical information. Does one have to buy the set to find out exactly what its contents are&gt 
 This is a great printer and the ink cartridge system is tops - but this item is available elsewhere for much less.  Amazon should do better than this 
 Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.  I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama. 
 I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it. 
 The description of the book made me believe that I would learn more about how children develop morals.  The greatest revelation of the psychiatrist author is that character is the foundation of behavior.  There are few novel thoughts stuck somewhere in the lengthy descriptions of his meetings.  I felt at times he focused too much on creating a mood or setting that is best left to fiction 
 Resorting to the metaphor of "bongs of a bell" to describe differential forms and "machines" to introduce the notion of tensors is a little insulting to capable undergraduate physics students.  This is one of the most overhyped and overrated textbooks I've ever used.  Physics and math students: Brush up on your vector calculus and classical mechanics and start with Shutz's "A First Course in General Relativity".  If you've had some general relativity already, head for Wald's "General Relativity" 
 Like many of the other reviewers I feel cheated.  Anything contoversial was left out.  As a dumb suburban honkey myself, I demand the reissue of this dvd with "Kill the White People".  What good are all those funny sketches if SNL doesn't have the balls to put them on dvd?  I also didn't read any reviews as I assumed I was getting the same product that was put on vhs years ago.  Instead I got scammed.  What's even worse is the "bonus scene" is the Opie Cunningham interview which was already on the original vhs.  Please explain how this is a bonus.  I was furious when the movie ended.  The least they can do is put out a part 2.  I thought I was buying the Cadillac of comedy.  Instead I got the Ford Pinto of crap 
 Gwen's (well, not that she invented these methods but she does emphasize them in the book) basic principals of eating when hungry and stopping when satisfied are very effective. Obviously, if you need to lose weight you need to quit eating so much.   BUT anyone reading this book should be very careful. Gwen feels that overeating means that you're being disobedient to God. And being disobedient to God will block your entrance into Heaven. Thus overeating will cause you to be rejected by God (you will not be accepted into the Kingdom of Heaven).   One must also be careful as this book is part of a full program, WeighDown Workshop, which is basically a tool for recruitment into Remnant Fellowship, Gwen's church (that's pretty much a cult).   However, if you follow the basic principles you will lose weight for sure. I did lose weight but I also picked up some really bad habits (like I stopped exercising and started starving myself instead (I was so weak I had to take a nap everyday for atleast 2 hours) to lose the extra weight). But if you speak to the people who lost a lot of weight and they are truly honest with you, they will admit that they eventually turned to starving themselves. Gwen suggests that you shouldn't exercise because then you are "helping" God take the weight off of you and you're not being totally obedient by fully relying on God. So by not exercising one has to eventually just start starving themself in order to lose the extra weight. By the way, Gwen sees carrying extra weight as sinful (this means you're being disobedient).  Bottom line, I would probably try some of the other spiritually focused books that talk about the same principles (eating when hungry, stopping when full). I do think the spiritual aspect is very important as that gives you the extra support you need to accomplish such a hard task as losing weight.   I have not read it but it's been suggested to me by ex-WeighDown members to try ThinWithin (same principles but with God's SUPPORT not God's VENGEANCE). It's on it's way in the mail now so we'll see!   If you're a Christian, pray before ordering anything and He'll let you know what you need to do. Then listen and DO IT!  : 
 Don't get me wrong, I love her shows, it is great to see how she pulls it all together in the 30 minutes without seeming rushed. The recipes, for the most part, are pretty healthy and have good variety. The lack of pictures doesn't bother me, as she's not really into foo-foo presentation with raspberry sauce swirled half-a-mile away on the edge of the dessert plate, imho totally wasting perfectly good raspberry sauce....  However, her books are *not* written to really go with the flow of her show, as in total meals being prepared at the same time.   The recipes, while grouped together as a menu, are all written separately, just like in other cookbooks. So, if you're looking to see what you should be doing *while* the water is boiling or something else is cooking, you're not going to get any help from her books, which is disappointing.   Believe it or not, it takes organization and good time management skills to get everything on the table hot (or cold, as the case may be) at the same time. Her shows do an excellent job of this--the books do not. She needs to look at redoing her books in both formats--recipes all being prepared at the same time to match her show, as well as the more conventional way if you want to mix and match. Then I would buy them.   In the meantime, watch the shows and take notes to get the process down, then get the books from the library or used from Amazon 
 "To Rescue a Rogue", Jo Beverly's Rogue finale, has a promising beginning, with Lady Mara St. Bride showing her spunk in extricating herself from a potentially ruinious situation and enlisting Lord Darius "Dare" Debenham's help.   He discretely cleans her up, and suddenly, she determines that she loves Dare  and always has.  Alas, he sees her in a sisterly way ... though her cleavage impresses him.  But wait! he loves her, too!  Melodramatic conflict arises in Dare's attempts to conquer his opium addiction and be worthy of her love, and how she pines for him.  Rather than her own strength of character, Mara attributes her legendary Black Ademar St. Bride hair as the explanation for her grit.  Meanwhile all the Rogues swirl around and Mara is suitably impressed.  Can they rescue Dare from Society's censure?  Will Mara and Dare ever marry?  Will Mara ever stop whining?  And what about her tonnish stalker who attempts to rescue Mara from Dare's overly public kiss?  Sadly, I found myself rooting for the stalker.  Beverly is an otherwise excellent writer, but with this one she fell short.  
 This is a kids book. First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book. 
 This method is what Chinese farmers have done for eons (4000+ years).  Every letter of W-O-R-D is a componenent of Chinese deep bed agriculture.  I find it shocking that someone can reinvent the wheel and proudly trumpet the reinvention.  I suspect he has read "Better Vegetable Gardens the Chinese Way" by Peter Chan with Spencer Gill(1977) and ripped it off.  I have a copy of this book and the parallels are too obvious.  Mr. Chan and his wife won Sunset Magazine's Best garden award in 1976 and the book was the result.  The unbelievable lack of intellectual honesty on Ed Smith's part offends me if no one else.  By the way, Peter Chan's book is worth getting.  It is short, succinct, to the point and very honest, plain, matter-of-fact.  Odd that the concept thief takes three-four times the space, but then liars often get more convoluted than the people they are plagiarizing, perhaps an unconscious attempt to obfuscate the theft 
 The author perhaps should confine his efforts to Blackfeet history ---rather than stretching to include them in a theatre in which they had no part.    If anything was interesting in this book, it would have to be how Custer continues to shape the identities of those who have agendas to push and paradigms to sell. Certainly, the historical perspective was biased to the point that it became just more stereotypical static. 
 Talk to the Polish and South Koreans, and ask them why they do more with less.   
 Despite the "Tech Specs" of Amazon, the WD NetCenter does not support RAID 1 (mirroring) configuration.  According to a Western Digital representative in their forums, "RAID functionality was tested with this device but was not implemented on the final product due to lack of interest from our beta testers. This feature may be implemented on future enterprise based external products, but will not be implemented on the NetCenter hard drive. 
 This book just drags on and on.  Buck's search for Chloe could have been handled in a fraction of the time.  One huge gripe, which represents incredibly poor writing, is the name changes used to refer to one character.  Ken Ritz is both referred to as Ken and Ritz, and not just in dialogue either.  One rule of good writing is to ALWAYS refer to your character by one name.  You wouldn't refer to a mother as Jane, mum, mother and ma in the one book.  Still, the book can be quite entertaining if you know what's coming next, which you would because it's been mentioned enough in the books.  One more thing that bothers me is recapping on past events-- the authors rehash the same old stuff 
 This carafe DOES NOT fit DCC-1000 despite the website's claim that it fits Cuisinart 12-cup coffeemakers.  It may fit other models, but definitely does not fit the DCC-1000 
 VERY GOOD PRODUCT VERY SATIsfied, the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even bette 
 I bought this book because i was looking for  "A Users guide to Earth's Interactive Energy Body,"    I'm still looking.   The book has a little of this and a little of that, it's very unfocused and seldom has anything to do with the title. It has the flavor  of the stuff we were getting in the 70's when interest in these topics was new. We have come further and the topic is still open to anyone who would like to write a book with practical information.  Though if you're still interested - I have a used copy for sale.  I wouldn't have bothered with this if the "see inside this book" function was working when I bought it 
 Like many others who have reviewed this movie, I can say that I am a huge fan of Colin Firth and Minnie Driver.  Why they are in this poorly written, poorly edited movie is beyond me.  Heather Graham is perfectly cast for this B movie; her acting abilities are on a par with the rest of what is going on here.  The characters are flat, many of them are just poor characterizations (Mary Steenburgen is just embarassing as the hotel manager with the fake Maine accent....painful to watch.) and they are all unbelievable.    I watched it all the way through and wished I hadn't. Save your money and get this one out of the library if you have to try it out 
 I was very disappointed when I received the dried cherries.  I did not realize that they included sugar and sunflower oil.  When I opened the package you could feel the oil on the cherries.  I had to rinse them in hot water before I could use them.  This information is not included anywhere in the description 
 The writing style of this book is very good and easy to absorb. It's relaxed instead of tense, and it flows. The characters are interesting and I could relate to them. What threw me, though, was the skipping structure. In one chapter, Rose and her dad Finn, move in. We never learn how they settle in, what they encounter, what they think about it. In the next chapter, a section starts with(something like)"...Colin promised to teach Rose the lute for a week now......" (Completely skipping over the first week of their living in a castle.) Then, all of a sudden, he's teaching her the lute. Another section starts with the heroine (the mother) telling herself that she shouldn't be interested in Finn. Then, all of a sudden, Finn and the mother are in bed together! Then, later in the book, we have some flashbacks to the first time they made love (without actually going there). Then at another point, Finn is asking the Saint about her life, which is then told in a passive way. This goes on and on throughout the book. Major events are told passively. Motives go unmotivated - why do Rose and Colin fall in love? Colin later leaves to join a monestary, joins a band of travelling entertainers instead - but we never get to see how or why he decides to leave home. We just come across his mother finding the Note he left. Big chunks of the story go unexplained and unexplored, leaving me to wonder why I should care about any of them at all? Then, of course, most of the characters die. Why oh why and what is the point? I don't mind people dying in stories, surely it can impact the plot. But EVERYBODY dies! Remember that midnight movie, the sci fi one that is a cartoon with Journey's Song "Open Arms" in it. Anyway, the charcter stands up and carelessly waves his arms and says "She dies, he dies, everybody dies." That's what this book reminded me of.  
 This one is a peculiar mix of populist polemic and third rate scientific argument. Deacon's approach to argument is endless repetition and obfuscation with detail. The initial chapters on indexical,iconic and symolic representation and language acquisition are hardly original and here needlessly complicated. Thick knotted prose, sweeping unsupported statements and carelessly "constructed" arguments abound. It is astounding and intensely disappointing to read the gushing uncritical reviews as well. In short, this book is a menace to critical thinking on this subject 
 There's something about Alex McKnight that resonates with me.  Maybe it's his bad attitude.  Maybe it's his sarcasm.  Or maybe it's that in the end, he's a sucker like me.  In this outing, author Steve Hamilton takes on a ride through Alex's past.  Through the streets of Detroit, Alex and his old friend, Randy Wilkins, are off on a crazy search for a girl Randy knew when he played for the Tigers.  When Randy gets shot, Alex tenaciously searches for answers.  The plot falls short because the set-up isn't that believable and the ending is too abrupt.  Furthermore, Randy's personality is quite annoying.  I'm glad he got shot.  An enjoyable read, but not Hamilton's best.      
 a bunch of yada yada to fill the pages. I will be giving my book to charity. all it is, is eating natural foods and a very expensive line of his vitamins. gimme a break 
 There are much better books out there covering these subjects. The biographies of Bacon and John Dee, for instance, are done much better in The First Scientist and The Queen's Conjurer. The authors clearly don't understand Bacon's science (totally misrepresenting his idea of species) and similarly know little about cryptography. Towards the end, in the surprisingly thin section on the Voynich manuscript, they comment that "no matter how brilliant the mind that fashioned a code, an equally brilliant mind might break it". This just isn't true - a one time pad may be a pain to use, but it is totally impossible to break, period. A real disappointment 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 I was very excited to see this frame, and thought that would be a perfect gift for a fellow geek. I was extremely disappointed to see poor the picture quality - it looked like the photos were taken using one of the first generation digital cameras that came on the market some 10 years ago. The resolution was similar to my first palm pilot (IIIx), just enlarged.  I sent it back after trying to get it to display pictures where you could actually see peoples faces. I believe that the pictures of this device showing colorful and detailed images were doctored or transposed to make this product look better 
 A big disappointment.After filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the "warmer" as advertized.It was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place.I returned it for a refund 
 These sages' examples of bravery and devotion are inspiring.  Their words, deeds, and teachings stand alone like all great masters. I feel blessed to have seen, read and spoken their sacred words.  For that I am greatful, however, what these sages do not need is a rude and angry woman standing on their shoulders with an axe to grind 
 right off the bat, JJ runs into an indian in the middle of nowhere, the indian has is gun JJ doesnt, oh boy the tension fills the air, no wait, for the FIRST TIME EVER, the indian turns and rides away, does NOT kill the white man, who is all alone on the Indians land, trying to catch HIS fish.     liberal revisionist trying to make the indian look like he is better than the white man, and oh smarter also, for just after that, JJ is trying to get a fire going "but" does this under a tree that has snow all over it, he gets the fire going and oh darn!  snow fell on it!  dumb white man!    If this movie didnt have superstar Robert Redford in it, would of been just another dumb movie, like that idiot Timmy that made Grizzly Man.     An Indian that lets a white man live all out in the middle of nowhere, LOL!  yes the white man stole the land, yes the white man did this that and everything else to the indians.   But its not like they were angels, they fought with each other just like the rest of the world has always done throught history.   to deny that, is just plain stupid.   The 1970's, marks the turning point the liberals took over Hollyweird.  Clint Eastwood never would of made this move in the 1960's, or ever.     
 When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done.  Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off -  "A Beautiful Mind" 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 Okay, I got it! Michelle was a bad lady, full of deceitful and murderous thoughts. She's the kind of lady we all love to hate. Good true crime story. But, reading this book is a lot like spending all day with my aunt Helen in Queens. I kept waiting for the author to write something creative to help move the story along, but it never happened. Bore, bore, bore! I just finished reading a similar story about another lady who conspired to murder her husband with her boyfriend (Dale Hudson's Dance of Death) and it was like riding a roller coaster. I couldn't put Hudson's book down. But with Fleeman's book, I couldn't wait to put it down. I assure you I won't be telling my friends about this book. Hey, I'm a generous guy, but two stars is all you'll get from me on this one.      
 I had read the reviews about this book being a bit disturbing, but decided to give it a try anyway.  My daughter loved the pictures of Carl, but her father decided to ban it, taking it to work to share with his coworkers.  The illustrations are great, and most of the story is cute, but the baby falling two stories in the laundry chute, and falling into the fish tank were not so cute 
 Am I the only one in this country that thinks that "The Clique series" is not only immature, but it's characters are spolied, rotten, and obssessive? It's because of these elements that I stopped reading the series at book 4.   And when I mean by obssessive, I mean that the main character, Massie, would do ANYTHING to keep her status of the most popular and most stylish girl in her school. Not only does is the author brilliant of showing her spoiled attitude, and her rude behavior towards over girls, but it's also clear that Massie is one of those girls that if she doesn't get what she wants, then she turns from being a sweet girl, into a nasty little brat.  Claire is also not only obssessive with getting into Massie's clique, but is also completely obssessive however her crush/boyfriend, Cam. I swear, there is not one single chapter in that book that Claire doesn't mention her "beloved" Cam. And what the heckw as she doing wearing an expensive Chritsmas dress to Cam's soccer tournament? Just to look "nice for him"? That is one of the many unrealistic things of this book. She's also completely obsessive over getting her first kiss from Cam, which is very stupid.   Not only does Massie and Claire drive me insane with their obssessive and spoiled attitudes, but Alicia's cousin, Nina is also a self-centered little brat as well. She's like only what- 13, and yet how can she be a "sexy vixen"?! She's acts like some flirtacious tramp, and sometimes makes some sexual and selfish comments as well. It also drived me crazy throughout the entire book that Dylan, Kristen, and many other girls in the book idiolized Nina for her beauty, "experience with boys", and her "physical features"- if you know what I mean.  Also, when Claire had to share her room with Massie, poor spoiled little Massie threw a tantrum over how Claire was "ruining her clothes". So Claire got a few stains on her expensive 500 dollar clothes.... just out them in the washing machine, that'll get the stains out!! It's like with Massie, she wears stylish and expensive clothes for like, a few weeks, or maybe a little over a month.... throws them out, and buys new 1,000 dollar clothes al over again! It's her type that I hate the most! (Actually, the only thing I like about her is her snappy comebacks.) It also makes me sick to the stomach how Massie and Alicia never get in trouble as it's stated in this fourth book of "The Clique series".. that's crud if you ask me. Massie's type is kind of girl that'll probably get herself pregnant by the age of 15.   And so, these are some of the many things that I disliked about "Invasion of the Boy Snatchers". 
 I couldn't get past the first few tales.  They left me feeling.... nothing.  Reading the back of a cereal box would have been more exciting.  I would definately not recommend this book.  As a fan of Earlene Fowler and Monica Ferris.  I thought I might enjoy "the cat who" series but if this book is any indication of the author's writing, I'll pass 
 After upgrading from TomTom 5 to version 6 (and even later after applying the 6.030 patch) I noticed that the screen would completely freeze at random times (especially when you need it most!). It would continue to give voice instructions if you're lucky enough to set up your route before it freezes, but there is nothing you can do to unfreeze the screen. Needless to say this makes this product useless for me, and there is no way to return it after activation 
 Mr. Bernasconi, in a far flung attempt to trace the problem of twentieth century racism to certain nineteenth century theological positions, has taken highly selective and controversial studies done in that century, in what appears to be a backhanded attempt under the guise of objective scholarly inquiry to paint with a broad brush the entire religious community of that era with a simplistic and in many cases unfair portrayal. He has unfortunately overreached himself in this endeavor, taking on a task fit for a more philosphically objective personality 
 Fails at it most basic function: to provide a non-leaking seal. You might as well throw the top away and just use your hand to cover  the top 
 There is essentially no topic in this book presented with enough quality information to allow the reader to make any consistent profit from FOREX trading.  If you picked the book up in a bookstore and wrote a list of the topics on a piece of paper, you would have a place to start your search.  In other words, don't waste your money.  The only reason I did not "hate the book" is because the information is essentially accurate.  But trading FOREX successfully (actually any successful trading) is difficult.  In this market you are trading with or against enormously deep pockets who know more than you.  If you want some alternative ideas, consider these three:      1.  Currency Trading; Philip Gotthelf; Wiley; 2003      2.  Day Trading the Currency Market; Kathy Lien; Wiley; 2006      3.  Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom-second edition; Van K Tharp; McGraw-Hill; 2007 
 I think that I am clearly insane, but I did not like this book. Everyone else in the world likes this book, but i am the insane person who does not. And I'm NOT sarcastic! I could barly read it a second time. I hated this book. 
 I purchased this at Target.  I only needed a light duty shredder for our home to shred credit card offers and misc. things like that. The first one I brought home was broken, the removable can was cracked and the shredder would run continuously. After returning the defective/broken one, I came home to shred.  For the first few days it was ok. It didn't shred anywhere near the purported number of sheets, even 3-4 was a bit much. I didn't worry though, I just fed it a piece at a time.  After a few weeks, the motor began to get louder. I should back up an include that I had to frequently remove the can and remove the wedged little bits of paper from the teeth.  It wouldn't quit running because of this, I just didn't like the idea of it jamming.  Anyway, the motor progressively gets louder. Then a whole new grinding metal sound appears. And a clunking. Who knew that shredders could clunk?  After calling Royal a few times (and being accused of putting foreign objects into it), I found I was going to have to drive it to the nearest service center or pay to ship it.  There was no mention of a RA or anything. Although, the last person I spoke to seemed to know exactly what the problem was and even described the sound without me doing it.  As I'll never have time to make a special run to take this in for service, it will be tossed out.  It has been replaced with a Fellowes shredde 
 The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.  The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax 
 I read this book and find it poorly written.  The Author has no real story line, he keeps going off in different directions and never keeping to the story at hand.  He puts too much junk into it.  First rule of any writing - keep it simple and straight to the one and leave the fluff out 
 With all the yapping the author of this book does about environmental impact, perhaps she should have considered the impact of wasting paper.  It is obvious within seconds of picking up this book why the author had to use pay to publish crap peddler, iUniverse to get this trash on the market.  When I came across this book I was looking for something to use as a supplement to McGee & Stuckey's The Bountiful Container.  I wanted a book that would get more in depth into building organic soil and using organic pest control and fertilizers.  I was also hoping for more than three (well known to most gardeners) suggestions as to which companies would carry good organic seed and product selections.  What I got instead was a lesson in internet book buying (check the publisher first).    Logan's book contains very little information that can't be found in the average gardening book.  She does almost nothing to address the specific issues relating to container gardening and organic gardening.  She addresses the issue of organic gardening in a lecturing tone by constantly pushing why organic is best, but barely touching on how to garden organically.  Her section on pest control dedicates an entire page to a photo of her dog, yet doesn't give any information on how to identify different pests or how to create organic solutions.  The few solutions that are mentioned are simply glanced over as though the reader already knows what they are and how to prepare them.  The fertilizing section is similar in that she lists a few organic fertilizers, but doesn't make it clear how or in what potencies they should be used.  The information contained within this book is limited and basic.  The formatting is clearly designed to maximize the amount of space the information can be spread into.  The author clearly uses the same tricks high school students use to spread a three page paper into five pages.  The primary section of this book takes up only sixty four pages (twenty of which are dedicated to poorly taken full page black and white photos), the majority of which is dedicated to lecturing on the evils of chemicals and very basic gardening information.  The remaining forty or so pages are dedicated to a glossary that could fit into half that if each letter wasn't started on a separate page.  Ultimately, if the author were to use a normal font size and less spacing between sections, the entire book could probably be fit into less than fifty pages.  By removing the filler, the portions of this book relevant and useful to organic container gardening could be fit into a pamphlet.  I've learned my lesson.  Don't waste your $12.  If you want a book that addresses container gardening well (and contains at least as much information about organics) get McGee & Stuckey's The Bountiful Container.  When purchased through Amazon it even costs less than this waste of paper 
 The authors do an adequate job of presenting the crisis of climate change in the first four chapters. The  book is touted as being scientifically rigorous while Bo Kjellen, in the forward, states that it 'provides facts enabling readers to form an independent view of the problems.' This is true for the first 4 chapters. But when it comes to solutions,  both of these authors are clearly in the anti-nuclear 'camp' for alternative energy policy. On page 11 they make this sweeping negative statement:  "Concerns over safety and long term storage of rad waste remain and it is not clear that its potential as an adaptation to climate change offers sufficiently strong justification to overcome economic barriers."  And so nuclear energy quickly gets buried by these authors, never to return again in this title. No sources are cited for this justification. No maps/statistics of countries with successful nuclear energy programs like France and Japan. No mention of nuclear energy's safety record in the US or worldwide (compared to natural gas, coal, oil). No chapter on the pros and cons of the latest nuclear energy technology. No estimation of energy demands the US will have when we're past the peak of oil and gas (which may have occured). No talk of eliminating dependency on foreign oil or the need for immediate and massive carbon emission reductions that are ONLY possible--in the short run-- w/ nuclear energy.  It's that simple...minded.  Why is this bias so prevalent? James Lovelock in the REVENGE OF GAIA treats this uninformed bias(propaganda?)in some detail in his chapter Sources of Energy. The romantic notion that renewable energy (4% of current world totals) will have significant impact on adequately quelling carbon emissions is the modern day techno-barbarism promoted by these authors. Yes, renewables (geothermal tidal, solar, etc.) WILL rise in use world wide, but to put such faith in renewables when a 60-80% reduction of carbon is needed for survival (according to the EU) is tantamount to deception on a personal and public level that only a J. Lovelock could expose, and  so vividly. Again, I refer the reader--especially those with strong anti-nuke feelings-- to Lovelock's latest release to get his rationale for what the stakes are at this stage of our climate history.   Lovelock and many others like myself are simply tired of the 'happy talk' babbling on renewables coming from authors like these as exemplified on page 87:  "Reducing carbon emissions to this extent will require massive changes to the world's carbon-based economy and our current inefficient use of energy. The GOOD NEWS is that many of the required technologies, such as geothermal, solar, and wind power, already exist, and there are many opportunities to improve and expand on their use."  Really? Again, what place does nuclear energy, which accounts for 20% of the energy production in the U.S., have in all of this? None for these two. This is absurd.  Of course nuclear energy is not an approved or 'required' technology for these two authors. Contrary to any 'economic barriers' cited by Dow and Downing, the real barrier promulgated by these authors--and the uniformed public--has to do with ignorance, which ends up driving a flawed political agenda for addressing climate change. (And don't the oil execs love that!)   The views in this book express an unscientific bias that fails to even consider the science, risks, and refined technology of current nuclear energy that one finds in Nuttall's book THE NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE (2005).  The dramatic carbon decrease from nuclear energy would certainly be the greatest benefit to human kind and planetary survival. Presenting the challenges of addressing climate climate with THEIR "facts" on nuclear energy, Dow and Downing do a disservice to the concerned reader seeking a comprehensive solution. Would these authors support supplanting China's dependence on coal(75% of their total energy pie) with nuclear? Of course not. I believe, like Lovelock, that the denial of nuclear energy as a player at the table--and the subtle squashing of ANY debate-- will probably lead to the detriment of all life on this planet. That may sound dramatic, but I believe the stakes are truly that high. We should not let authors like Dow and Downing attempt to rationalize away a technology that, apparently, they have little familiarity with.  RATING: 2 1/2 stars. Time for a revision. And a rapid paradigm shift 
   I can't agree with . Shih "M.Smith"'s review even more. I just can't stand the arrogance tone shown in this book. I got a feeling that the authors simply don't like the progress in China. It seems like the authors are simply trying to minimizing the progress China made and relishing the problems China has.   I seriously doubt the authors ever read any Chinese sources or talk to any Chinese scholar. The authors seem to imply that if the Chinese to follow the American way, then they will never succeed. True, China has a tons of problems. But the Chinese leaders and Chinese people are trying their best to solve them. What annoys me is that some of these authors seem to relish over the fact that China has so many problems  You won't get that much new info about China in this book. Yea, China has tons of problems. Who doesn't know. The authors are trying to answer the most complex questions of China with simplistic answers. 
  FYI, this guy is not a real Indian-he is a white man pretending.  That's been proven by DNA. And he was never a member of a tribe, it was "honorary" and was taken away.  The AIM movement came out and said they don't want him speaking for them, that he's a "wanabee" and that they don't like his racism. If you don't believe me, go to their website.  They have a whole section on him and others like him.  That kind of make me not want to read anymore of his books.  I full believe that what was done to the Indians was very wrong, but I'd like to hear about it from a genuine source-like an actual Indian historian, not some fake who apparently hates his own race.  This is not a "victims" perspective at all.  He's not the victim 
 I gave this machine 1 star because the carafe does not drip -- and this is important!  However, for a household that brews several pots of coffee a day and likes a good, rich, bold cup of coffee, the Cuisinart Grind & Brew is a poor choice.  The grinder doesn't have the bean capacity for 10 cups (however, the carafe is really closer to 8 or 9 six-oz cups).  WEAK COFFEE.  If you grind a batch then turn it off and grind a second go to make a suitable pot, it is STILL weak.  Somehow the brewing process wastes coffee.  It backs up into the grinder and makes a royal mess.  Of course if you want to brew another pot in an hour or two, the grinder has to be hand-dried after you wash it with a bottle brush to get all of the wasted, caked, wet grounds out of the grinder.  Now here's the real kicker that nearly drove my husband over the edge.  Say you've washed the grinder and it's drying in your drainer so you decide to brew a pot of GROUND coffee, you still have to use the grinder!!!  It won't brew without it in place! so all that condensation flows right back up into the grinder, which stays perpetually WET and begins to pool in all the indentations here and there in the grinding chamber.  It's a mess.  The coffee us terrible -- even if you use plentiful, bold Starbucks coffee!!  Gosh!  We might as well have flushed $150 down our toilet . . . 
 I can't agree any more with the reviews that have pointed out the poor writing in this book.  As a fan of stories about Chinese Americans and of historical fiction, I was sorely disappointed with this novel; what could be emotionally-moving scenes just aren't because of the "see jane run" kinds of descriptions.  There is no skillful subtlety in this novel.  I normally don't like to be this publicly critical, but this is one of the only times I've felt this strongly about something 
 There's so much wrong with this book that I don't know where to start.  It's the third Eloisa James I've read, and it is also without doubt the last.  She's lost me for good with Fool for Love.  -  Darby is a thinly drawn hero.  He looks like Johnny Depp and he likes lace and that's pretty much all that James has to say about him.    -  Henrietta starts off charming but turns into a shrewish stick in the mud.  Early in the book she's very understanding and mature, but once she gets it into her head that it's time to start impressing Simon's friends, or London in general, everything she says is catty catty catty.  She became in the blink of an eye a truly despicable, moralizing faux-sophisticate.  Especially all of the insulting comments she directs towards Darby's best friend, which James tries to pass off as "wit" but are anything but.  -  Henrietta's devotion to the children overwhelms the romance.  This, too, steers the novel in the direction of obnoxious moralizing.  I should have guessed what was going on when Darby sees Henrietta covered in VOMIT and thinks about how the sticky liquid molds her dress to her figure and is really turned on.  I know that romance novels are frequently unrealistic, but that made me feel queasy.  By the end of the novel, Henrietta's major selling point as a heroine is her endless self-sacrifice for babies.  - The Esme subplot was similarly irritating.  Esme is pregnant, she feels fat and ugly, and so the knight in shining armor rides in on his white horse...in order to assure her that pregnancy hasn't made her ugly and go gaga over the miracle of life.  I know that there is a whole sub-genre of Romance that is about men who just can't get enough of domestic pleasures, pie-baking and cozy nights by the fire and apparently vomit and pregnant women.  However, that sub-genre is not Regency and I was really unhappy to find it sneaking in here.  I've come to the conclusion that James' schtick is to take these supposedly "free" or "scandalous" women and recoup them one by one into staid, rule-obeying, traditional and unremarkable mommies.  She kills their fire and personality.  I, for one, think it's truly awful 
 The others summed it up.  Cheap parts, difficult to adjust. Put your money towards the EZ Rip instead. Costs more but much better results 
 One of the things I spend oodles of money and time on is previewing books for my kids. I so value books that can tell a story in something more than an informational tone. I thought this would be a promising book for my "middle" kids - out of picture books, but not ready for high school / adult material.   The write up above states ". . this book will change children's ideas of who Leonardo was and what it means to be a scientist." The cover has an attractive illustration, and I went for it.   I scanned the first 3 chapters, and they were well written for the upper elementary/middle school age group. Vocabulary was understandable, spacing of the type and size of print not intimidating. Then I got to Chapter 4, "Nothing But Full Privies"   The whole chapter is about homosexual activity. "This was the office that summoned Leonardo in 1476. Someone had anonymously accused four men - Leonardo, a goldsmith, a tailor, and someone related to Lorenzo de Medici - of having sex with a male prostitute."  There is further text on his story, what Florence laws and views were on homosexuality, and then, "Historians disagree about Leonardo's sex life, or whether he even had one. But most think he was probably homosexual. . . . Various writings show he shared the common male attitude of his time: women were less intelligent than men and full of "useless chatter." He described the act of procreation as 'repulsive.' Homosexuality was illegal . . . The authorities in Florence generally fostered a don't-ask-don't-tell policy. In fact, homosexuality there was so widespread that the German word for homosexual was Florence. But being discreet was crucial . . "  Okay, I already knew this, but . . . do my children have to get into THIS level of detail of Leonardo's history to understand why he was a Giant of Science??  I do read classical works to my kids without censorship, and there are references they may or may not understand. But they are not highlighted and focused on gratuitously. I have forgiven a passing, non-highlighted reference in some books that my kids don't even seem to notice. The Parrot's Theorem is an example of a book with a few adult references, but they are not so pronounced as to color the whole book for moderate families. I felt this book's chapter on homosexuality was WAY more than necessary and ruined this book for the purpose I purchased it. For a high schooler or adult, it may be appropriate, but do not hand it to your child unless you are ready to explain adult sexual issues in detail.   I DID find a WONDERFUL da Vinci book for the middle set that has no such references, and it is truly wonderful: Leonardo da Vinci: Genius Of Art And Science by Jennifer Reed 
 Artie may well be a baby gorilla, but the film sucks 
    Reilly fans will probably find his latest novel to be quite a disappointment. For some reason, Reilly forsakes all the things that made his earlier books great.  Instead, this novel is a thinly disguised political statement which reveals Reilly's prejudices against various governments and religions. The plot is obviously borrowed from "The Da Vinci Code" and the characters are one-dimensional pawns whose main purpose is to verbalize Reilly's personal ideology.  For the first time in a Reilly book, I managed to finish the book out of sheer determination rather than out of any interest in the plot or characters. 
 At his best, MacLean is near the top of the pulp action genre with interesting locations and characters and a bit of romance.  "Fear", a story of revenge, misses the mark.  I never could quite connect with the protaganist and surprisingly, the ending was neither compelling or, to me, satisfying.  Other MacLean books such as "Dusty Death" and "Caravan" better display his true abilities 
 This movie I think was just plain depressing! Just when you think something good and happy will happen, someone dies, people seperate, bones are broken, so on and so forth. This movie got alot of great reviews, and it was a fun movie, but for people who like complete happy endings, this film is not for you. 
 The book is trite, boring and difficult to read. Poorly worded exercise questions make the book unbearable. The ideas are difficult to understand. Perhaps, a good editor could have saved the book. Or, any editor for that matter.  
 Equilibrium is a curate's egg - its best parts are not good throughout, and its worst aspects make erratic appearances. The acting is really the least of its problems; the cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of movie it wanted to be when it grew up.    Equilibrium, however poorly, aspires to be a dystopian film, and there exists a dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike. Such a formula was employed magnificently in Michael Radford's adaptation of George Orwell's 1984. Contrarily, films imperil themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by Alfonso Cuaron's junky adaptation of P.D. James' The Children of Men. There are essentially three parts to this formula. First, there must be a depiction of a believable society, and plausible justifications for its existence. The author or script writer must paint vividly, yet remain nuanced, since at this stage his purpose is to show the reader or viewer, without yet telling him the philosophy underlying it. Second, two-thirds of the way through there must be a conversation between protagonist and antagonist, which formally unveils the ethical dilemma. Here, the protagonist offers his alternative, usually an acknowledgement of the humane. Third, the dystopian resolution lies in the protagonist's choice: he must surrender to the system, rebel against it, or be conquered by it. The ending, if it is not tragic in the classical sense, must be ambiguous; if it is ended happily, it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers' thoughts: the problem has been resolved, and he may retire from it and become forgetful of it.   Libria, the society depicted in Equilibrium, is a post-apocalyptic society wherein feeling has been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings, and the actions carried out on their behalf, represent the fons et origio of man's inhumanity to man. The objective of outlawing sentiments is the preservation of peace. Is this believable? Ultimately, it is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this society to exist, no justification for its brutality except that it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved. However, a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war, and aversion is something we principally feel. A more believable premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings, but it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent. The protagonist (John Preston, a member of the Grammaton Cleric, an elite government agency for enforcing laws against so-called `sense-crimes') marries, begets children, hesitates in killing his partner - what point would there be in any of this in a society that had eliminated feeling? And, if we are being generous, and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to say, "You can never entirely eliminate feeling," it fails still; because if the denizens of Libria weren't completely devoid of feeling, they couldn't be as cowed as they are depicted. Instead, countless times throughout the film characters make comments, statements, enquiries that can only have as their possible source or response an emotion. To have had characters who were truly apathetic, or for whom the fictitious drug Prozium was effective, they would have had more in common with Star Trek's Borg. The backdrop for this dystopia, then, lacks subtlety or nuance. From the first fifteen seconds of film, the viewer ethically objects - it remains tediously Manichean throughout. The viewer is given a straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen.  In Brave New World, it is Mustapha Mond's conversation with John the Savage. In 1984, it is O'Brien's talk with Winston Smith. In The Children of Men, it is a debate between Theo and the Xan. In Equilibrium, the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens in a haphazard way throughout, culminating in a fight scene that lacks the awe inspired by the Matrix three years before. Here was the moment for the "talky" bit of the film, the sophisticated counter-punch, the moral awakening, the vindication of the human; instead, the viewer is given another low-brow, Hollywood denouement. John Preston does nothing to justify his alternative to the totalitarian status quo - there is no bit of dialogue with Father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that "Feelings are essential to thought," or that "peace has been obtained at a terrible price." All the loose ends, littered liberally throughout the film, are never addressed: Why have art in Libria? Why does Father intonate, and raise the pitch of his voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a Leni Riefenstahl propaganda film? A better film would have acknowledged these scenes, and defended their inclusion in a climatic dialogue between John Preston and Father (or DuPont as it turns out).   The conclusion of Equilibrium can be summarized as follows: "Good guy kills bad guys, sixty-second revolution ensues, people can feel again, hero smiles, time to go to bed." There wasn't ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway: what was wrong was obviously wrong, and what was right was intuitively right. The viewer never believed the reasons Libria came to be, or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found Huxley's, Orwell's, James', Zamyatin's, or Koestler's explanations. In Equilibrium it was all simply the soft groundwork prepared for the banal, unoriginal action movie to follow. The plot, then, was in some respects as shallow as the tendentious storylines in soft-core porn films: they needn't be sensical because no one is interested in the story, but rather for the titillation, arousal, and amusement. Many viewers of Equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences (a majority of whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest); but for those seeking a fuller cinematic experience, Equilibrium is an unfortunate disappointment. During the film a woman asks Preston, "Why are you alive?" Preston responds with the bureaucratically sterile answer, "I'm alive to safeguard the continuity of this great society. To serve Libria." "It's circular. You exist to continue your existence. What's the point?" she asks. And, what's the point is exactly the point about this film.   
 Shackley could have chosen to enlighten us about what he learned as head of CIA's Miami office in the months before and after the JFK assassination.  He chose not to do so.  There is no mention of many issues raised in other books that he could have discussed to make a major contribution to history.  He never mentions Operation 40, or operations against the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (which Oswald made famous by his association with it), or the efforts of anti-Castro operatives to blame Castro for JFK's murder (which he would have known a lot about), or his testimony to the House Assassinations Committee, or his knowledge of operatives, or alleged operatives, accused over the years of complicity in the events preceding JFK's murder.  On the other hand, there is ample coverage, with many pictures, of the award ceremonies in his honor, if you are interested in that sort of thing.  I wonder why this self-named "Spymaster" bothered to write this book.    
 she is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls!   PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!!   Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one! 
 While De Zengotita's ideas are all fine, his writing style is much too convoluted and very often it's difficult to figure out what he is trying to say.  He jumps around a lot and it seems as if he's rambling too much and that there isn't much organization to the book.  I did learn a lot from his ideas, which I thought were great, but his writing was quite terrible 
 This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him 
 I read this book with an open mind.  I am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status.  In a few cases, I think this criticism may be legitimate; in other cases, not.  So I was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the Holocaust or their advocates in the Jewish community.    (Note:  I am not equating child abuse and the Holocaust.  I am saying that when people speak up about terrible things, there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities.  All things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction.)  I didn't find anything in this book to convince me of that.  What I found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the Jewish reaction to the Holocaust, in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over, and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons, but this discussion is so subjective and brief that I was not persuaded to adopt his point of view.    The bulk of the book consists of complaints that Jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as Switzerland.  The argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because I have never read the reports ("audits," etc.) to which the author refers.  But I think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point.  I expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the Holocaust caused some Jews to "play the victim card," and what I got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which I have no way of determining the truth of the author's allegations.  To me it seems obvious that the Holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the Jews, and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result.  It seems reasonable to me that the Jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage, and to the extent that this book detracts from this, I think it is unfortunate 
 It had a couple laughs, but it got very old after the first 30 minutes, and then it started falling into the very dumb category. Like "naked gun" kind of dumb, maybe even worse than tha 
 I'm very disappointed in this book. For the price, I would have expected a little more accuracy, a little less typos, and perhaps a matching key overlaying the computers for the listed ports? Come on - who would have made the mistake and called Bill Gates' magazine influence in January 1975 "Practical Electronics"? For the price, I would accept this? The Apple II model - purporting to be a USA model in the text - have the 230 volt plug insert. I'm sorry, but this kind of error - and the full page pic of the TRS 80 Mod II next to the Model I text, and not referenced in the next page when the II is discussed - and where is the Coco? The TRS80 Mod 100? Why not note that the Acorn was a direct ripoff of the Apple II? People, if you are in the states, forget it. Leave this one to the market that actually could buy most of the computers listed - not that it wouldn't have been exciting to be part of the European tech scene in the late 70s/early 80s. But is Mattel's Intellivision really worth noting as a computer?  Ouch. 
 I have tried a few recipies out of book and none of them were very good.  I even threw out an entire pot of sauce and a whole pan of bars.  This is definetly not my favorite vegan cookbook 
 This book shows you how to write the Kana and provides some exercises to help you on the path. The best way is to just write the Kana on and on (of course following the rules of writing them). 
 Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people 
 I am a cartoon, and a comic fan.  I have been for years.  I think it is great that marvel has finally started putting out some great cartoon movies to show us in motion what these heroes can do.  The first Ultimate Avengers was cartoon-violent at times, but I thought that is was ok for my 5 year old daughter to watch.  But the second Ultimate Avengers, I thought this one took it a little too far.  There is a lot of hacking and slashing, a lot of really brutal fight scenes, and not alot of the Avengers.  Usually hero violence is punching the badguy out, or throwing him through a wall, but in this film they are trying to kill, and that is hard to watch with a child in the room.  I watched it once with my daughter, and ended up covering her eyes for portions of this film.  For me, I kinda liked it, but I won't watch it very often.  For my daughter, I wouldn't want her to watch it again 
 USB jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in (it works now, but has to be held in by hand).  Came with no instructions, and, if you don't have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers, you won't be able to figure this out.  The driver CD is useless more or less, since they don't send you a "product number," which is needed to access the menu on the CD.  It works, and I am able to send files to and from my phone, but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer, and a whole lot of cursing. I won't be ordering anything from them again, and if I had it to do over, I'd order the cable from a different company 
 The batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a boy who adores batman. But this same boy gets extremely frustrated trying to shoot the coin shaped projectile that it comes with. You have to insert it "just-so" to get it to shoot when you press the button and my son doesn't always do it, then I have to get a butter knife and pry it out so I can put it in for him. For 10 dollars it's worth it, so long as your child doesn't absolutely want a shooting batmobile.   PS. My sister bought the same one for her son this Christmas and is having the same problem, so I do not think it is unique to mine 
 I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books. 
 It is very evident that the author is not familiar with the game of Soccer. He has written a book that simply accounts lives (that are nothing short of boring)  with a Soccer game thrown in on the side. This is ok for  the Oprah show but not as a book recounting a great  sporting upset.  It  would been have far more interesting if the book explained in detail the  then current global state of the game , and  some history of the U.S  national team up until that time.  How did they get entry to the World Cup?  were there qualifying games?  Give more analysis to the actual game. Were  there any more goal chances for the U.S. did the English control the game  for long periods?  The book also does not give enough attention to the  actual 1950 finals themselves. In short a disappointing boo 
 Poorly written. Brutal content. Chinese portrayed as barbaric people with animalistic behavior. Lalu's father sells her to bandits knowing 50 men plan to gang rape her to death.Refers to how her dark skin lessens value. Lalu, 13, contemplates suicide as an honorable solution. The bandits draw lots to see who goes first. 43 is upset because she will be "mushy" by his turn. She is sold to a brothel, ends up in a saloon owned by Hong King,a cruel man who rapes and prostitutes her. Writing painfully too simple. After the first 100 pages, most of this book moves slowly like an amatuer biography written by a family member about grandma. A boring, brutal book written at a 1st grade level. Can be disturbing to those sensitive about children being raped 
 This story is very dark, full of menace and dark thoughts. Not great for kids. OK for adults if that's what you like. A hard story, not much gentleness in it except for a couple of moments 
 I still don't know what year France occupied Austria. This book is GARBAGE! I paid 20 dollars to learn what year France occupied Austria and you know what I got? Tips on how to redecorate my stove.   Like a stove needs redecorating anyway...  What next, an autobiography by Bill Clinton? 
 So who does the perpetually disingenuous David Brooks speak for? Why do the NY Times & PBS find him interesting? Is he for real or is he an invention of the Liberal establishment?  Hard to tell from this collection of unastounding thoughts. The man does seem to know his audience & demographics though.  Which is really depressing 
 If you are a single woman without children, this is not the book for you.  I was extremely disappointed in this book, especially given all the five star ratings.  It took me less then ten minutes to read any portion relevant to my own life, as it was almost exclusively about maintaining friendships when you are married and especially if you have children.  Furthermore, I completely reject the idea that a woman without children must make all the sacrifices to maintain a friendship with a woman who has children which is the premise of this book.  Friendship is a balancing act and the sacrifices should not be placed on the shoulders of one person.  And while other reviews have stated this book says men do not need friends, I did not see that.  However, this book is exclusively about female friendships with other females and does not include men in the equation at all.  After all, women can be friends with men.  
 I bought this book specifically because it said it would show you how to build a screened room. From the book's front cover, "A complete how-to guide." I had been turned off by other books which simply said if you want a Gazebo, buy a kit and here's how to put it together. I don't have the budget to build from a kit. I need to put in the sweat equity. I bought Building Screened Rooms because I saw that it did have directions and a material list. I took it to the lumber yard to buy the materials. They explained that there was not enough detailed instructions or material specs to be able to build this. He said, "If you have a really knowledgeable builder, he may be able to figure this out for you."  Not everyone is rich enough to just drop a wad of money on some architect, landscaper, builder, gardner and step back and watch them do the work. There are real live people out here who need directions because we are willing to work to attain what we want and can't just buy everything. I am so completely and hopelessly disappointed!! 
 OK, 72 pages of cliff notes for a 144 page book?  That is absurd!  Night is a classic work, filled with vivid metaphor and intensely emotional characters.  You could get a third of the way through it in the time it would take to BUY the cliff notes 
 The "Latin" moves in this workout seem strangely like American aerobics to me.  You can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves, but if you're interested in Latin dance, my advice is to buy Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac instead.  This workout just isn't as energetic and fast-paced as it looks 
 I expected to learn something considering the blurb promised a woman bringing herself to orgasm with a variety of techniques and a step-by-step guide to the anatomy of an aroused genital region. I was wrong. The most boring 30 minutes of a woman using the same technique, very limited and ultimately a complete waste of money. Useful for no one but a complete novice. I threw it in the bin 
 I was going to read this book. I bought it for a graduate class I'm taking in the English department at the university where I am attaining my Master's. Then I looked into the history a bit and decided that to read this book would be to engage in ideological rape. Albert Camus did not give his CONSENT to publish this book in this version. Period. Posthumous publishing of a dead author's UNCOMPLETED work or works is immoral and unethical. I don't need to quench my voyeuristic thirst by reading something the author never intended me to read. Some might argue otherwise, but I just don't see how peeking at your sibling's diary is EVER justified. It is someone else's private property, we don't have a right to read it without their permission.  Sincerely,  Sean Hook

 "The Ring Two" is a horror film that gets so bogged down in the minutiae of its storytelling that it simply forgets to be scary.  Naomi Watts and David Dreckman return as the mother and son who have recently fled to a remote section of Oregon in an attempt to escape the murderous clutches of Samara, the ghost of a young girl whom they encountered in the previous film.  However, like any specter worth her salt, Samara has managed to track the pair down and quickly begins her scheme of possessing the boy as a way of returning to the land of the living.  This is an extraordinarily under-whelming thriller that is little more than a series of extremely mild shocks (if you even want to call them that) interrupted by long stretches of hopelessly dull exposition.  The story itself makes very little sense, and the climax is so blasï¿½ and half-hearted that I couldn't be sure the movie had actually ended until the credits started rolling by.  "The Ring Two" has a few impressive special effects up its sleeve, but not nearly enough to relieve the tedium that afflicts so much of the movie.    In a mere two installments, this series seems already to have run its course.  If this "Ring" comes a-callin`, don`t answer 
 Meanwhile a lot of other people written very good books in a very different stile: Suzanne Clothier (Bones would rain from the Sky) Patricia McConnell (The other end of the Leash) Turid Rugaas (Calming Signals)  We have three Irish Setter and we prefer a soft method for our dogs 
 Marc Eliot is the literary equivalent of Edward D. Wood, Jr. 'Nuff said 
 we bought this thinking the suctions would keep the darn thing on - boy were we wrong!  the suction cups are so weak that my cat jumped onto the toilet seat and knocked it over.  save your money 
 As a fan of both golf and films based in biography, I expected to thoroughly enjoy this film.  Unfortuneately, it was, on the whole, a let down.  Part of it was the casting... with Jim Caviezel in an awful dye-job that was a constant reminder he was just playing a part, his appearance and his acting did not begin to enbody the man I have studied thru books, internet, and documentaries.  Part of it was also the script that lacked engaging dialouge.  With the exception of Jeremy Northam as Walter Hagan (the one bright spot in the movie), the characters were two-dimentional and forgetable.  My advice... if you want a good golf movie with true story backround, skip "Bobby Jones" and see "The Greatest Game Ever Played."  It outsines it by a mile. 
 First, let me state that I have been impressed by all the Canin I have read prior to starting "Blue River."  The problem with this novel isn't that it follows pattern similar to Canin's other works, most notably "For Kings and Planets," a far more mature novel, but that the protagonist is very hard to empathize with.  A successful California optimologist, the protagonist spends the too much of the narrative defending his materialism.  When he's not bothering with that, he's repeatly over-describing his less successful brother (After the first few times, I understood that the brother was violent and troubled during high school).  There's a good story here, but it's trapped under a poor, plodding narrative 
 This is an EXCELLENT, comprehensive book on solid state chemistry.  However, the expense of this book is a joke.  Save yourself the money, and check it out at a university library 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 I only have one word to describe this video, BORING!!!!!!! Don't waste your money!!!  That is, unless you need a video to put the whole family to sleep 
 This is a book about an exhibitionist hippy, who despite her hippy ways, does love America.  The exhibitionist hippy, like so many tree-hugging hippies, ends up in Oregon.  Good for her 
 This book is awful for the price.  Each subject has hardly any depth to it and the printing is bad.  Some graphs barely show up on the page.  There are much better books out there than this (O'Connor's comes to mind).  
 May be a good source of reference for a beginner in .NET but most of the recipes don't tackle any tough problems. A lot of what is in this book can be easily obtained from free sources such as MSDN online .. 
 My girlfriend is reading this book, I've only skimmed it briefly.  I do detect a tendency on Pearce's part to be anti-scientific, and to make claims without giving evidence.  In any case, who are the  "Kirkus" reviewers that the other reviews lambaste?  Seems odd  that they are represented only by their detractors.. 
 This book is a piece of useless .... Aliens from space? Where's the proof? This book is full of second hand accounts of this and that, but in the end they don't add up to squat. Overall I think Donald Keyhoe was a charlatan trying to make a quick buck. This book is only for the UFO faithful 
 Dreadful, insipid, poorly written drek..Truly--how did this author get published, much less have a prequel?  I wanted to like it, and tried, really-- but couldn't. The main character is in no way interesting or likeable, but shallow and narcissistic,  shocked to find her marriage on the rocks after confessing to one affair while on her honeymoon, later taking up with another lover only to be caught by her her husband via an email.  She hangs onto her husband pathetically while he wants out, is seeing another woman, and pines for him even though he is emotionally abusive and their sex life is nil. Of course, our heroine is unable to eat and borderline anorexic which translates to fragile beauty and there seems to be no man unable to resist her.  Poor poor Sarah. She ends up with a gorgeous home in France (basically a compound which she is remodeling) and the house in London, which she sells for an amazing cottage there. She treats herself to a new car (of course the salesman wants to nail her as does every man she meets).  Its difficult to feel sorry in any capacity for this woman who never has to consider how to get by on her own, rent a dingy apartment and feed her kid mac and cheese while she waits out a modest divorce settlement, which is more realistic.  The last third of the book is all about her sexual reawakening and we have to get through pages and pages of nonstop lovers who are entranced by her supposedly gorgeous body, and her non stop orgasms.  Ridiculous. As another reviewer wrote, it's obviously a poorly contrived auto biograpy by the author, who happens also to be named Sarah. I have never bothered to write a book review in the past, but this one was so bad,  I had to. Do NOT waste your time. Any of Anne Tyler's books or Anna Quinlan, etc. are much better. However, if you are into poorly written (the typos and grammar and style is unbelievably awful)  romance novels, this might be just your style. 
 I very highly recommend this book for those who are interested not only in the public but private sides of A,B,B, and A. I was especially interested in tracing the paths each member took to finally arrive at their music we love.  I also learned what a difficult business selling music was and is, as well as something about Sweden and her people. Very enjoyable reading. 
 I was excited to see that Steven King had a new novel out.  I began the book full of anticipation, eager to enter into King's world.  However, as I began to read I became more and more unable to sustain interest in Lisey's world.  I was bored, and I gave up.  Perhaps I will try again some time;  the book is still weighing down the shelf 
 Last week, I happened to come across this book in the library. As I had recently bought "Writing a Book that Makes a Difference" and "Writing Creative Nonfiction: Instruction and Insights from Teachers of the Associated Writing Programs" by the same author, I thought it would be good to read this book to get a feel of what's in store when I finally get down to reading my own books.  Gosh! I hope the other two books are better than this one. I tried hard to read this book, but I had to give up finally. Call me a philistine, but I just could not "get into it" (I'm at a loss with words to describe how this book simply could not grip my attention).     
 Many words - few practical tips! This book did not give much more (-valuable-) information than I already had found out by reading the manual delivered with my pocket computer.  After reading the book I still had to search for web communities, where some of my questions could be answered.  My expectations when buying the book were mainly focused on the need for practical hints concerning how to manage tasks, contacts and appointments. Unfortunately, in my view, these important and basic issues were treated too superficially.     
 Let's see. Ken Starr wastes the public money attacking Bill Clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with KON-servative Mitch Mcconnel of KY to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there aren't any already !!! This book is a perfect tool for neconservative NAZIS to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by Bush/Cheney/Rove/Delay and GOP with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend Clinton but easily caved into and defended Bush the liar-in-chief ! 
 Reading other reviewers' positive words on this page, you would never know that Rose's book is riddled with errors of fact, despite her almost total dependence on secondary sources.  But a discerning reader might wonder at the facile slippage between person and movement (as she does with the life and family of Theodor Herzl in her psychoanalytical outlook) or at the extrapolation of a full blown theory from interviews with a few fanatic settlers.  How she manages to get Shabtai Zvi as the remote founder of her version of 'apocalyptic' Zionism (oops, messianism) is likewise unconvincing.  Rose is a talented professor of English; she should stick to her last 
 The book spends too much time on developing a questionaire and what errors you can have in sampling a population. Then in the factor and discriminate sections the books blows throught it too quickly and doesn't explain the difference between determining attitude vs. behavior differences. Not a good book for non-MBA people, even as a class textbook it wasn't so good 
 This has to be one of the worst ever organic chemistry books ever devised.  The author will give a detailed explanation with illustrations and at the very end of the discussion , once you have committed the information to memory,  the book will say that it does not happen this way. The author seems to wax poetic,  however,  he gives no simple list of rules for common nomenclature problems,  for example,  I defy you to find a list of how to name alkanes under IUPAC rules. All you want is a simple list , for example,  1) find the longest chain of carbons, 2) .........  instead of this you will be exposed to extraneous quotes from plays and movies as well as anecdotes from the authors life.   Another complaint is that the book gives several good questions in the text and at the end of the chapter,  but NO answers in the back.  If you want the answers,  you have to purchase the 40.00 solution manual.   My condolences to you if your o-chem teacher has been hoodwinked into using this book by  the publisher,  the only advice I can give is that you purchase the solutions manual,   because this gives some very detailed explanations.  Good luck, because you will need it 
 I found this book insufferable, and didn't get to finish it.  The contrived title should have tipped me off.  Why isn't Amazon listing it correctly? It should be My Garden (Book):  For started, i don't really care for Jamaica Kincaid's writing style.  She uses punctuation sparsely, and you go for what it seems like a mile with no period in sight.  In the meantime, she has branched in a myriad of extra information, and after a while it gets to be too much to keep track of.  This is not stream of consciousness writing, or at least not the good kind anyway.  What really did me in was the beginning of her anecdote titled "Reading":  "It was a day in late October and I had two thousand dollars' worth of heirloom bulbs to place in the ground [...]"  If that wasn't enough, then she continues:  "I do not like winter or anything that represents it ..."  What is she doing then living in Vermont?!  She came across as a malcontent human being who agonizes over insignificant stuff, like the exact month her wisterias bloom.  She takes the joy out of gardening, and out of reading 
 This book is certainly written in a surprising format, and some of the passages are interesting.  However, in attempting to follow Cha's thought from one part to the next, the thought itself disappears, leaving only a form.    This book is clearly written for a very narrow range of readers: recent female Korean emigres to America who also know French, as well as extremely knowledgeable scholars.  Those who do identify in some way with Cha's biography do find a way into the text.  The two articles I read as part of a study of this book were written by Korean American women, who did find something meaningful in Dictee.  I, however, was lost and confused most of the time by the often minimalist use of words, their repeating, and the sudden jumps in theme and style.    Buy this book only if you fit into the above mentioned category, or if you have much time and desire to struggle through a confusing work for a questionable reward 
 After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house.  Aha, I thought, the story begins.  But alas, not much happens.  Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be.  Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no.   Danielle Steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them.  The story of the grandmother's life in the house would have been tremendous.  I think maybe she had a Visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly, because she did not put any thought into this one.  Where was the editor on this one?  It was a bummer.  Virgini 
 Let's talk about the heart of the matter here with regards to Christianity. Jesus Lives... can other faiths say the same about their god? No other God on earth came to live and die on the Holy Cross of Calvary and then resurrect to further spread the Good News.   No other god has died for every imaginable sin and carried it on His back to the slaughter. It is prophetic, this persecution and mockery against those that believe in Jesus. Scripture lists this prophesy time and time again:  Job 17:2 Surely mockers surround me my eyes must dwell on their hostility.   Psalm 1:1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.   Proverbs 1:22 'How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?   Proverbs 3:34 He mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble. Proverbs 19:29 Penalties are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools.   Proverbs 29:8 Mockers stir up a city, but wise men turn away anger.   Isaiah 29:20 The ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down-   Hosea 7:5 On the day of the festival of our king the princes become inflamed with wine, and he joins hands with the mockers.   As I read this book to my husband, he looked at me quietly and said to me after seeing my sadness: It is these people (referring to Harris) that the Lord has called us to love- despite it all.   I know that there are plenty of people who will continue to put God in a box (these are the intellectuals)and will want to fit Him into their scheme of things but God wouldn't be God if he was that small...   I know Harris loves himself and demonstrates the epitomy of narcissism in his propaganda. But the truth is, he will one day know the faults of his stinging attacks against Christians, humanity, and those that strongly believe in truth.   I also grieve, like many unbelievers, when I see a Christian, a person after the heart of the Lord, commit a moral failure... it only proves what we keep hearing from the world: Christians aren't perfect. This I know full well. But it is because of this truth that keeps us apart from the Lord, thus the reason for Jesus' birth.  I have to believe a loving, merciful, and yes, jealous God exists for this reason and because I see so much depravity, so much immorality in this world.    How many crimes go unpunished in this world?   I have to believe that although man in all his faults, injustice, and sin will allow for criminals to walk free, there must be an Almighty judge who sees all things, and will give those their due reward.   Harris' rant is what it is: a piece of information from a broken, shattered heart that can only be redeemed by the One. Remember that all things will be revealed... in His time.  I recommend these books:  The Bible, New King James version.  Joni Eareckson Tada's 'When God Weeps', for those that want to know why God sent His innocent son to die for us all.  'Love Beyond Reason' by John Ortberg, for those that continue to wonder how God sees us in this broken world. 
 return? ha ha!!! you must email them for permission. they don't provide the email address. i have spent untold hours trying to get them to respond. they will do everything to avoid returns. and amazon just looks the other way.   don't do it! 
 It seems clear that much research went into this book, unfortunately with very little visible editing.  There is much tedious repetition of the same point. Extraneous information peeks out at us without elaboration. It is true that New York emerged as the center of American publishing, but why tantalize the reader with this fact by means of a single sentence in the midst of several pages about the garment industry. The treatment of the 1911 Triangle fire is far too minimal, and suggests, erroneously, that this was a solely Jewish experience.  This is most emphatically not the case, either in terms of the victims or the long term political consequences both for Jews and the Democratic party.    
 This book is more about his autobiography, and albiet amusing at times, isn't a real investing book. His other one: Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World is much better 
 I also had the surprise and joy of having my carafe's glass lining explode. The carafe had a little over 1.5 years of use, and I never used any sort of abrasive on it.  Note that for the price of this replacement carafe, you could pay for most of a whole new coffee machine 
 I remember the day I got the email alert from the ABB website announcing the formation of this band. As I read the line up I couldn't believe my eyes, just a few weeks before I had been having a conversation in which some friends and I were imagining the perfect band and I described a lineup almost exactly the same as Frogwings.  The only difference between Frogwings and my fantasy band was that Jaimo was in my group and rather than Edwin McCain, the singer would of have been Col. Bruce Hampton.    But I could handle McCain and as tour dates were announced, I made plans to go to see them.  Sadly time and money never allowed me to see the band with McCain, but I did manage to get some audience tapes that had terrible sound quality, but from what I could hear, the band was pretty good.    Later on when more tour dates were announced with John Popper replacing McCain, I was even more intrigued.  Although I wasn't the biggest Blues Traveler fan in America, (I did like the second and third albums when they first came out, but the third and fourth ones turned me off and I haven`t given them another chance since), the addition of popper did open up some interesting possibilities.  When the new group began touring the same thing happened again, but this time I was unable to get any audience tapes and thus remained ignorant of how the band sounded with Popper.     Then I heard that a CD was coming out and was pumped.  Finally I would be able to listen to what a band that I had been trying to hear sounded like.  I got this sucker the day it hit the store, tore into the package and threw it on.  After listening to Kickin' Bach, which I liked, I skipped through the next song.  Then I skipped through the song after that.  Then I skipped through the next one as well, at this point, I was beginning to notice a startling trend.  As much as I didn't want to admit it, the CD left me disappointed.    Not long after, I lost the CD and didn't make any effort to replace it. Derek Trucks new (at that time) CD had a studio version of Kickin' Bach on it and that was enough for me.  A few years later, six of them to be exact, a funny thing happened.  I was driving down the road and the song "Pattern" from this CD came on the radio and to my surprise, I liked it.  The same song that a few years before I had rejected had unexpectedly captured my delight.  Against my better judgment, I ordered a used copy from here and when it arrived,  I threw it on and once again I was disappointed.  Subsequent listening has done little to change my mind, but I must admit that the more I listen to it, the more I like it.   I guess to sum things up, this CD is at worst a sub par effort given the talent assembled and at best an acquired taste.  Not that it matters, but my friends that have heard it tend to agree with my assessment that it could of have been great, but is instead just barely good.  We all agree that it's a bit to hectic and could have showcased the Burbridge brothers a little more.   I do wish though that they would give it another try, but with Col. Bruce replacing Popper. 
 Interesting to see a book like this come from Prestowitz, former Undersecretary in the Reagan Administration.   Back then it was America losing its good jobs and future to the Japanese.  Remember them?  Japan, Inc....central planning...national industrial policy...would soon be running the world.  American debt, loss of technological edge, outsourcing would all mean the USA would be reduced to second-world status by 2006.  It was precisely because Prestowitz's Commerce Department let the 'hidden hand' of the market prevail that we wound up with the economic boom of the 90s.  So it is very strange to see Prestowitz ring the same alarm bells he firmly rejected a generation ago.  Seems every economic book I read these days remeinds me of the early 80s....alarmist.  That is not to deny the issues he raises in this book, but to paint a grim and destitute future for the American economy is tired and not well thought out.  That, in the end, is why this book only gets two stars.  Intellectually it's bereft.  Nothing new here 
 Sadly, Wright throws up the facade for his Evangelical readership that Early Christian resurrection stories should be taken as literal and historically defensible.  Should we expect anything different from someone socio-religiously tethered to his own conservative community and market?  Wright foists upon his readers technical propaganda aimed at certifying the myths of his modern Western religious tradition.  His often grossly dishonest use of primary literature characterizes his overt, Evangelical program in the book.  This work is not an open historical inquiry, but an apology sold to his already deluded market.  The one redeeming value of the work is that Wright surveys a large array of ancient literary sources, and so one gains a substantial list of primary references for investigation.  If, however, you wish to read a far more balanced work on the topic, might I recommend G. Riley's Resurrection Reconsidered.  Riley is a true Classicist and scholar of nascent Christian traditions, not a traditionalist or apologist.  Evangelicals somehow still get away with the same ploy.  The idea goes something like this: the larger my book, the more erudite and authoritative it will be in its reception (e.g. Bock's commentary on Luke is larger than a PacBell phone book).  Let's be honest about one thing.  Wright has not produced this volume for the larger scholarly world.  He has plainly written the work to insulate his own Evangelical market from the realities to be found in careful investigation of the question being tabled.  Since most will never read the 1000 ancient works (in their original languages) required to even weigh his argument properly, the Evangelical world becomes falsely satisfied that Wright has dealt with the matter handily.  
 The content of this book should have been the informercial for this book.  Although I understand the need for self promotion.....this book goes way overboard. Everything has been said before and at the end you feel like this book was geared for these two mens' fans and not people who are really looking for ways and means to get out of the rat race.  Hey Robert! We know about your other books and your game.  Donald, we know about your show.  Its great that those things made you rich but we want books with less fluff and less talk about your crap!!!! Honestly, if you havent been living under a rock for the last ten years, this book is a BIG waste of time and money!! 
 Ooh Dear Seth - what happened?  This book is an extension of purple cow, perhaps the bits he failed to add. Plain and simple it is anecdotal at best with no facts to back up his assertions and at worst it is simply another way of financing his vacations to Europe.  Seth's recent books are rapidly shrinking in size with less and less to say, if you are a Seth Fan (I used to be until he started churning out half-baked books without substance) pick up a second hand copy. Seth talks about holding off marketing slight improvements and waiting until a substantial customer driven Free prize emerges. Well Seth take some of your own medicine and bring us a new book with pages, content and a few facts to back up your ideas.  Disappointing...      
 I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype.  I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since "Running with Scissors".  I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art 
 This book is very basic and very very standard stuff it makes me wish I could go back and change my review of Paul Vunaks "Anatomy of a Streetfight" and give him a higher score because he puts alot more useful info in his book. I really wasn't impressed by this book you would be better off buying Paul Vunak's book or even Diallo Frazier's "Revelations of a Warrior 
 The title of this book is very intriguing and the subject of learning how to improve communication skills when things are rough is very compelling.  I was astonished and very dissapointed with the author's approach - so much so, that I was not able to make it past page 35.  I would not have made the expenditure had I known that the author created a platform for her philosophy of relationships.  Had that been my interest at the time, there are far more interesting treatises on the subject.  I rate this book as a 1 because there isn't a lower number 
 The book takes far too favourable a view of Extreme Programming [XP]. It ignores increasing results from industry about the brittleness of XP. You would benefit more by looking up "Extreme Programming Refactored: The Case Against XP" by Stephens and Rosenberg. It goes into gory details about actual XP attempts, including the famous initial one at Chrysler.   Which is not to say that Hunt's book is entirely wrong. Parts of it, like the need for unit testing, are not bad at all. It should be adopted in many projects. And the waterfall approach does have severe problems. But you can buy into agile programming without necessarily going to the extreme of XP 
 The script for this flick is great. So the flick has its moments. It could've been a real solid film.  What went wrong? First, casting. Eugene (Silverman) was spot-on for the role and he played the role perfectly. He should be commended for his performance. The father also, in a minor role, did the same. So congrats to them. Unfortunately you cannot ignore the rest. Feh... casting! Really what burns this movie is the poor performance of the Jewish mothers--both Aunt Blanche and Eugene's mom. They negate the comedic effect of the movie, which is just as important as Eugene's bit. The essence here behind all the drama is Eugene versus his mother but in a light way. A funny way. But the Jewish women are harsh Valkyires; they deliver their lines without a bit of the comedic chutzpah intended.  The last strike against it is that it wavers between being a converted theater (play) script and a regular Hollywood movie. What I mean by this is that quite a few scripts have been converted to a movie style, for example Biloxi Blues the sequel, David Mamet's films, and others. Then there are those films that seem scripted, as if we are watching a theater production--a conversion from the stage to the silver screen. This can work really well. Yet the screenwriters/directors did not make a decision whether to go toward one direction or the other.  It's all a shame. Eugene's monologues with the viewer (again, something we mostly see in theater drama not movies) are golden. The jokes are great. But the rest is just poorly adapted.   Should I recommend this movie? I want to because of the plot and Eugene's performance but at the same time there are so many problems it bothers me. So here's my rec... watch the movie Biloxi Blues, the next part in the series. Biloxi Blues is a better movie, better written, better acted, etc. Get a feel for the character. Then watch this one. If not, do not bother.  
 Too many characters.  Too vague.  Too bad.  I'm sure this could have really been a great book, however it failed miserably.  Each page I turned, I kept thinking "it's got to get better".  I just finished it.  Trust me.  It doesn't.  Skip this one over.  Pick up Wally Lamb instead 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 I bought this album because I heard one of its songs on the radio and really liked it.  I didn't expect to like any of the others but they weren't too bad 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 If you are looking for a very easy and quick to read book this is the one for you.  What to Expect When You're Expecting is written by a mother (Arlene Eisenberg) and her two daughters Heidi and Sandee.  These ladies have written several books in the series, they call "What to Expect When..."   There are a few positive aspects of this book; the author's give information on the month to month physical changes that occur during pregnancy, including physical discomforts and how the fetus changes throughout the nine months.  There is some basic information on medical conditions that may arise during pregnancy and basic breastfeeding information for the immediate postpartum period.    This is a good book to read for an overview of pregnancy, labor, birth and the early postpartum period.  I would recommend that you also read other more in-depth books such as: The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth written by Henci Goer, The Pregnancy Book, by Dr William Sears and his wife Martha Sears, RN, and Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, RN, Midwife.   
 In this book New York University Professor Richard Wolin digs up postmodernism in order to kill it yet again. Nicholas Fox demolished it in 1993, Paul Gross and Norman Levitt in 1994, and John O'Neill in 1995.   Now Wolin reprises that postmodernism reprised the counter-Enlightenment, concluding banally, "Postmodernism's hostility towards 'reason' and 'truth' is intellectually untenable and politically debilitating."   Postmodernism was just a version of the ancient idealist claim that objective knowledge is impossible. Idealism is a dangerous, reactionary philosophy, whether religious or post-whateverist, because it denies knowledge, reason and truth, and denigrates science, industry, technology, democracy and socialism. It prefers metaphor, myth and magic.  Wolin reminds us that Friedrich Nietzsche was a leading counter-Enlightenment writer, who preached, "The annihilation of the decaying races ... Dominion over the earth as a means of producing a higher type." Naturally, Nietzsche adored the Roman Empire, Alexander the Slayer and Cesare Borgia.   Later, Third Way theorists in the 1930s flirted with fascism. Martin Heidegger was an outright Nazi, and Carl Jung was a Nazi fellow-traveller. After the war, post-structuralists, like Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault, and postmodernists like Chantal Mouffe were briefly famous. All worshipped Nietzsche.   But why does Wolin bother with these discredited poseurs? They have no influence now - who reads Heidegger? Who, apart from his publisher Verso, has ever heard of Mouffe?  Wolin's attacks on German and French philosophy chime in with the US state's attacks on 'old Europe'. So Wolin plays up the German and French New Rights, just as Labour plays up the BNP. He obediently links Al Qa'ida with Iraq, and sneers at national liberation struggles, absurdly lumping Fidel Castro with Idi Amin, Mobutu and Duvalier.   Wolin reveals his hostility to democracy when he writes of "the regressive social psychological tendencies displayed by the masses." Finally, he praises the USA's "breathtaking social mobility ... in striking contrast with Derrida's tradition-bound, native Europe."   Recent research has proved that the USA has even less social mobility than Europe's nations, but Wolin, in a postmodernist kind of way, doesn't let mere facts get in the way of capitalist dogma!  
 A false dichotomy has been built in the non-scientific Creationist camp, and with it is implicit the assumption that if Evolution - though a Fact of Science - could, nonetheless, be disproved, then (by default) this proves the existence of an almighty, omniscient, benevolent Creator. "But wait...!!"  They shout, "Who are you to say that the THEORY of Evolution is a fact of science?"  This question stems from an unfortunate, common misunderstanding of the word "theory".  "Theory" merely refers to a framework by which processes can be explained.  Thus, we have the uncontested Theory of Gravity and the Theory of Plate Tectonics.  Now - we all know gravity exists, and we should all be aware, at this stage, that Evolution does too.  Creationists (now re-marketing themselves as the more scientific Intelligent Design advocates) are growing exasperated by the Scientific Community's growing refusal to let their misinformation stand unchallenged.  Creationist pseudo-science has been soundly beaten and the answers to all supposed "Questions Darwinist's Would Rather Avoid" are available to anybody honestly seeking the truth rather than a convenient belief that will compliment their religious convictions.  Perhaps it is for this reason that Marvin Olasky reaches into the past and attempts to breath honour and nobility into the ignorance that brought us the Scope's Trial.  Here he presents the Prosecution as both the majority view and the underdog, victimized by a Liberal Media.  No amount of spin though, can put a positive light on the absurdly simple William Jennings Bryan ("associated prosecuting council") who, under cross-examination from Clarence Darrow, made the mystifying claim that "If God had wanted a sponge to think, a sponge could think."  He also asserted that humans are not mammals.  Bryan further displayed his utter stupidity by expressing his belief that the world couldn't possibly be older than five thousand years.  This Literalist Biblical interpretation puts Scope's Trial creationists not only at odds with Biology, but with History, Geology, Common Sense and Decency as well.  How could the media, liberal or otherwise, do anything other than laugh at this flagrant buffoonery?  The title of the book, Monkey Business is, itself, a rather annoying reminder of red-faced rants I've heard in which an indignant Creationist will express his disgust in the idea that Man was born of Monkey.  It's worth mentioning that this isn't, nor has it ever been, the claim of Darwinism.  Darwin never asserted that Man was spawned from Monkey, but rather that both species evolved from a common ancestry.  The fossil record now clearly indicates that this is correct.  Creationists like to claim that there are inexplicable breaks in the fossil record.  They are behind the times.  The gaps have since been filled, proving Evolution (again).  What makes Evolution worth fighting for?  Simply: Our understanding of Evolution determines our future progress.  Viruses grown immune to antibiotic treatment can not be understood outside of an evolutionary context.  Genetic diseases must be understood in an evolutionary context.  As acclaimed geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky said, "Nothing in Biology makes sense, except in the light of Evolution."  We all stand to lose if Evolution is marginalized in American schools. There are those who like to try and turn the tables with the claim that Science itself is the dogmatic religion and that the Intelligent Design advocates are merely trying to promote "open-mindedness".  This implies a mis-understanding of what Science actually is.  Science isn't an arbitrarily chosen belief system, like a religion, based on bias, superstition, fear and ignorance.  Science is a system by which we test, observe and conclude based only on reproducible experiments that are then subject to rigorous peer-review and validation.  If a piece of the puzzle doesn't fit, Science will not distort it to make it fit or omit its presence to pretend it doesn't exist.  Individuals who do this will be found out - by Science.  The Blurb for this book makes the astonishing assertion that modern creationists have nothing to be ashamed of. Let us think on this.  If it is not the believers of creationism that should bear their shame who, then, should?  Perhaps it is the propagators of pseudo-science - who have led people to believe that there is some type of debate in the Scientific Community when there is not - that should be ashamed.  And as for this book, Olasky should be ashamed.  Ashamed of his poor hack-work, ashamed of his plain ignorance, and ashamed of his own un-evolved mind that has left him far behind; somewhere in the Dark Ages 
 Repetitious and disappointing for someone who bought all Santana records LP's CDs and DVDs 
 Contains nothing but very abstract mathematical concepts and formula derivations that would only be of interest to scientists.  This book offer NO examples or PRACTICAL insight on how fiber systems actually work.  Useless 
 When I bought "The Draco Tavern" by Larry Niven it was rated "4.5" or "5" on Amazon reviews.  I was disappointed; it seemed more like a "1" or "2".  Larry Niven has written great short stories in the past, but these stories aren't worthy of his name 
 To all Christians that see this CD in your local Christian store or in the Christian music section be fore warned this is not a Gospel CD.  It is R&B masquerading as Gospel.  No one in the R&B market would sign George Huff so he convinced Word Records that he really is a Gospel artist.  And an artist he is, let's look at the picture he paints:  Cd title "Miracles" (must be a Gospel artist). Song Titles "Real Love", "See what God can do", "Miracles", "A Brighter Day", "You Know Me" and my favorite "Feels like Heaven" (must be a Gospel artist).  And the last picture is just that, CD art image: praying hands, eyes closed look toward heaven and the Cross ring on his finger (must be a Gospel artist)  Do we blame Word Records for signing him? No they have signed other secular artist.  Do we blame the George Huff team? No any CD deal is better than no deal.  What about George do we blame him?  Yes!  George Huff is a gifted and talented singer and I enjoyed him on American Idol.  But he has allowed the people he has chosen to support and surround him, to pimp him and the Christian community.  A "Miracle" is a good R&B CD but, a very weak Gospel CD.  Other artists have tried to do the same thing, use the Christian committee as a spring board for their careers and have failed.  (If you run into Michelle Williams ask her about her sales numbers of her so called 2nd gospel CD). We love you George and want to support you, we just need you to come back home and you will have the whole body of Christ behind you.  Don't sell Christ short he never sold you short.  You have established a foundation under yourself, be it ever so weak, build on it and use what is not yours and build his Kingdom.  God Bless you Brother 
 About two years ago, Vanity Fair was not only the best magazine of the year, but maybe all time.  I would read it from cover to cover.  Now, sadly, it is a bunch of fluff.  The quality has really gone downhill.  I am going to let my subscription run out.  I really miss the old days 
 I have been reading James Patterson's books since the first Alex Cross came out. I thought the first 3 or 4 Cross books were brilliant but since then I feel the standard has dropped gradually to where we reach London Bridges.  This book has a solid storyline that needed fleshing out but I think the author was in too much of a rush to get the book on the shelves to worry about the story.  Let me get this right - Alex's family are taken hostage in the final few pages of the book, we get a couple of pages devoted to Cross' work and then the family is returned. There was no discussion on the anguish Alex was facing, nothing on the fear that the family was facing, nothing written about this at all! It would have been better to have taken them at the start of the book and have the book devoted to the fear that Alex was facing and his determination to catch the Wolf and get his family back.  If Alex was so dedicated to catching the Wolf, why was he taking so many time-outs throughout the book to visit little Alex, have dinner with his numerous friends etc?  Most disappointing, Mr Patterson 
 Eric Hobsbawm, dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of "scientific" Marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history, wields the critic's pen more like a butcher's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes, a la Don Quixote, he is thrusting. So it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as Hobsbawm's Sancho Panza. As such I appeal to you, Eric, not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian, for it is the most preposterous thing I have ever encountered. Perhaps you were intrigued with the Greeks' romantic, albeit "unscientific," appeal to the muse for inspiration? How else can we, your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth, justice and the human way in the study of history, explain this unhistorical incantation? Have courage, though! We know that your unwavering adherence to the "scientific" precepts of Marxism will excuse everything. In short, Eric, we know that you have been writing too much while watching Star Trek 
 I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD. 
 It is sad that this series celebrating 40 years of Star Trek did not reach our expectations of being a real contender.  The initial idea could have made this the greatest Star Trek series written to date.  The first in the series, Crucible McCoy was far and away the best though it tended to ramble and to over repeat already well known classic Star Trek TV episodes and films.   While longer than need be, the longest of the three in this series, it did give an interesting study of Leonard "Bones" McCoy.  I gave it five stars despite reservations over the overuse of well known  material.   Crucible Spock was far below the first in that it was repetitive of past outings by other writers and frankly rather boring.  Knowing how the second book of a triology can be less than the first I gave it four stars in charity.  The idea was that the third and last book would be a hum dinger.  That all the magic of classic Star Trek would be right there for us to enjoy.  Sadly this is not the case.  The author admits that it was a hard book to write and it is shorter.  You don't need to read the first two books, though you should the first if you haven't. David R. George III acts as though you haven't read them and repeats material from his first two. This final book in the series does not really resolve anything.   I consider myself a big Star Trek fan, have all the DVDs and a lot of memorabilia (including numerous books) in addition to knowing well several of the stars.  I have used Star Trek in my teaching and have written articles about what I consider one of the media giants of the 20th Century.  Had the author just combined these three books into one giant volume, only referred to past events in shows we have seen without detailing the plots of so many, and not repeated so much this would have been a great addition to any Star Trek library.  If the reader is as unsatisfied as I am about how the author ends the last days Kirk, Spock and McCoy, there are much better books.  I will only recommend one series here.   I refer to the series by William Shatner and company.  It is the far future of Picard, Janeway and Sisko, but the three we have known so well are especially there.  Kirk has survived thanks to alien outsiders, McCoy is very old and still going with the help of bionics and Spock is of course on hand.  Not married, though Kirk is for a while, and free booting about the Galaxy in a special ship again saving the universe.  Shatner, or whoever is doing that writing, gives us the real Star Trek we knew and loved.  Mr. George just doesn't undestand the Star Trek universe 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 If you take the time to write a biography of a person, isn't it part of one's research to interview their wife? Donya Fiorentino was married to or lived with David Fincher for 5 years and gave him a daughter. When they met, he was directing Pepsi commercials, and when they split up, he was an auteur. For some reason, Sharon Waxman made no effort to interview or contact Donya, and dismisses her in two sentences as an alcoholic and drug addict. In fact, Donya has been sober for 6 years, is a brilliant and creative photographer who has an edgy side to the Fincher story that has never been told. I know the truth; as Donya's physician I have heard her compelling story. Waxman also does not mention that after their divorce, she married Gary Oldman. This was written with my patient's permission, who was very hurt by this book's publication 
 I don't know what to say, other than that this confirms what a loser I am.   
 I wouldn't even bother writing this review with how bad this guide is, except there has to be an outcry at the crime this book is.  It delves too deeply into the classes which is about the only thing it delves into. Good information, but long winded and a good portion of it not useful. It seems to skim and skip over the whole game. Hinting and gesturing. It's worth 2 stars because it has some information and will help give you an idea of what to look at for building up your character, but nothing else. As if they were afraid to spoil anything. If I didn't want anything spoiled, I wouldn't buy the book. And now the only thing that's spoiled is my opinion of this game guide. It completely falls short of anything towards useful 
 There used to be a time when philologists had an intimate knowledge of world literature. For instance, if you read Erich Auerbach's classic "Mimesis" you enjoy the book of an grand old man of letters who like a souvereign displays his careful and passionate readings of the classics, and gives you thoughtful reasons why Homer could not survive. Compared to this grand old tradition Victor Hanson's book is thin-lipped and merely offers cheap polemics. One misses refinement and culture 
 This book is good as an overview to give you a starting point of what you can use as quantitative methods in managing projects. However the book contains mathematical errors, not typos but actual reasoning errors ... use with caution.    
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 If you need a guidebook that will help you plan an itinerary, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! This book, while chock-full of information, gives no practical tips whatsoever about how to arrange activities while touring. I read through it twice and came away with snippets of information but nothing that helped with actually planning how my family would spend each of our four days in the city. The index is incomplete and much of the information is sketchy at best. I would NOT recommend this as a resource, especially for first-time visitors 
 The product came in perfect condition, however, there was a piece missing from the container making the trick impossible to complete.  It is an unfortunate thing, but not the fault of the seller, just the manufacturer 
 I haven't tried all the recipes in this book, but I bought it because I was interested in techniques for making fondant and chocolate-covered candy.  However the techniques are not well described and simply wrong - for example the method for chocolate tempering leaves out several steps.  I only discovered this when I went to another cookbook to find out what I was doing wrong.  Now I use this book for ideas, but other methods for technique.  This book is not for novices.   Very disappointed 
 I checked out this machine at a local store.  It's little more than a basic drip coffee maker bundled with a basic espresso machine.  For that functionality it would be far cheaper to buy those two things separately.    Regarding this Delonghi machine, on the drip coffee side, metallic coffee filters are a royal pain to work with-- paper filters are far easier to use when disposing of coffee grounds.  On the espresso side, you have to grind the beans and tamp them into the strainer for each cup you make, and then empty the strainer when you're done.  The optional filter pods are a really expensive way to buy ground coffee. For only a bit more money ($500 or so) you can get a full automatic espresso/cappuccino maker. I bought a full-automatic several years ago and my family loves it! Full-automatics grind the beans for each cup, they make excellent American-style coffee as well (simply by increasing the amount of water pushed through the coffee), and you dispose of grounds once a week.  The only disadvantage of full-automatics is that like every espresso machine, they do only one or two cups at a time.  So if you want to make more than two cups of drip coffee at once, you'll need a plain old coffee maker like the right-hand side of the Delonghi 
 I didn't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out, and it does take standard garbage bags.    After a few months of use, the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off.  I assembled it back together, and within a few days, the spring broke in half.  I tried to get another spring by calling Safety First.  They only had the blue top without the spring.  The guy said I'd just have to buy another pail if I wanted a working pop top 
 Despite being a comedy show, this turned out to be a rather depressing experience. There were a few amusing bits here and there, mostly there, but the targets of the satire were very lame.  Most of the parodies are from pop culture in the 1990's, so they are extremely dated.  The "Information 411", "90210", and Yakmin Shirmnov sketches were particularly painful to watch, as bad as anything on SNL.  I only made it through the first 8 episodes, and skipped the last 5.  The commentary on episode 8 was more interesting (check out Garofalo screaming how she hated kissing a sock puppet because she hates "sexuality".  I still don't know what she meant by that) than the actual episode.  As we know, Ben Stiller became a star playing neurotic, clumsy nerds, Andy [...] has done a plethora of drugs and seems to be on the path of being the next Courtney Love (in terms of obnoxiousness and drug intake), Janeane does supporting roles in mostly forgettable (and sometimes wretched) films (even though she does have talent), and Bob Odenkirk did Mr. Show and recently (as of November 2006) directed the awful Let's Go to Prison.  The only sketches I remember in which I mildy laughed were the "B Minus Time Traveler" sketch.  Stick with Monty Python's Flying Circus, which is still unsurpassed in sketch comedy.       
 My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive.  Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel.  But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved "turn-a-round".  The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines.  Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey.  Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers.  "Last Call" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to "Gods 
  I would not recommend this book. I found this book a real disappointment.  I do not wish to spend an hour figuring out what the calories in every meal are.  There is a lot of information, but it is spread at random all over the book and the index is almost completely useless.  It also recommended calorie intake levels that I believe would be appropriate for a roofer or a dockworker, but for most people with sedentary jobs, she was very far off.  
 Seemed like a good start, however pages 25 - 57 were missing and I had to return it, Am waiting for you to send it to me and I will be happy to review it the 
 Robert Allen's previous book, Multiple Streams of Income, is EXCELLENT and I can't say enough good things about it.  This one was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT in comparison.  He talks about the same rehashed Internet marketing strategies that everyone else does.  Creating email lists, newsletters, blah, blah, blah...  The most disappointing thing about Robert Allen -- and I lost so much respect for him over this -- is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast.  What's stupid about the whole thing, and demonstrates that he's a snakeoil salesman scam artist, is that what he's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the Internet...so how do you make money on the Internet?  According to Robert Allen, by selling courses showing people how to make money on the Internet is the only way to make money on the Internet.  That's a scam!  How does he sleep at night?  Don't buy this book.  It's a waste of money 
 If you like nude guys wrestling each other for 1 whole hour then this is your movie there is no after  scene like in a hot steamy shower. Just nude guys wrestling I thought it was boring 
 This is a unique book. It gives a historical account of the environmental changes imposed in the Mediterranean area as a result of human activities. The author approaches his subject from a holistic point of view and provides well supported arguments, in most cases, for cause and effect relations. The first time I read this book was several years ago and was looking forward to a new printing to purchase my own copy. I did that about a month ago. The material is still the same. However, the quality of the figures, maps and photos (and there are many of them in this book) is far inferior compared (like photocopies) to earlier printings/editions. The quality of the photos (about 30 of them) is simply unacceptable. Considering that I paid $42 for a paperback, this gets even worse. In the past I thought that a publisher like CAMBRIDGE provides a guarantee for a quality publication. Not any more. So, this is excellent material in a very bad package. Get earlier printings if you can find them 
 Gosh, I'd hate to be a student in a Wong classroom. Wong's book is an endeavor in positivistic manipulation, a recipe guide aimed at reproducing good little consumers who never question the authority figures in the Foucauldian nightmare world Wong and his fellow behaviorists have conjured. What Wong does not seem to realize is the children he obviously sees as objects in need of control and manipulation are going to be adults with little capacity for critical thought and decision making after 13 years of suffocation in any school under the thrall of the Wong way. Add the fact that the "practical" tips in the book are completely useless in 99 percent of the public school classrooms, and the Wong book is not only a waste of money, but a real danger to students subject to teachers sucked in by Wong's platitudes 
 1) The screws that came in the box have no relation to the screws shown on the assembly diagram--nor do they fit in the various holes available to screw them into.   2) Even if the right screws came with it, the pieces are so mis-aligned that it would be impossible to assemble the unit. The screw holes just don't line up 
 This book is old news and is filled with predictions for 2005 & 2006 - most of which are inacurate.  His boom and subsequent bust theories are not materializing - and at this point even if they do will be of much smaller scale than his grand predictions (DOW over 40,000) presented in this book 
 It doesn't make discs worse.  And it doesn't fix every possible scratch.  Some people here think it'll fix severely damaged discs.  It is intended only for reasonable damage.  However, I spent $49 for the motorized version at Best Buy.  It worked and I'd give it about 9 out of 10 rating scale on fixing the library's badly scratched discs.  But a year later (maybe less!), it appears as if the internal gears are stripped.  Apparently the gears inside are plastic and don't last long.  Unfort., there's not much choice on CD scratch repair machines to choose from.  I am forced to have to buy the manual version now, or go back to what I was using before - a drill-powered buffing wheel and car finish buffing compound.  
 Gaultry is a young, beautiful, spirited huntress, who has been raised by her great-aunt, a hedge-witch, on the border of Tielmaran.  One day, the outer world cruelly ends her idyllic life, as a squadron of soldiers seeks to abduct her, and she finds herself a key figure in a prophecy that will bless or curse the entire realm.  Ms. Reimann creates, for the most part, a well-imagined world with some fresh touches.  However, the kindest thing I can say about her telling of the story is that, this being her first novel, she shows glimmers of potential.  To identify the major problems: First, the story begins, for the sake of excitement, as Gaultry and the prophecy are about to collide; consequently, the plot is over-burdened with flashbacks and info-dumps about the history of Tielmaran--information that could have been much more gracefully integrated via an earlier starting point.  Second, the magic 'system' involves drawing power from the realm's gods (yet spells are called spells, not prayers), and its workings are never defined well enough to bear the crushing burden of the book's climax, which also spins out of control from Ms. Reimann's inexperienced quill.  (An unfortunate example from p. 374: "There was a weird short-circuited merry-go-round through all the bodies in the circle, an unpleasantly long dance, before the Glamour-spirits were properly settled."  Note that neither circuits nor merry-go-rounds are otherwise known to exist in Tielmaran.)  Finally, several plot-threads are left dangling, presumably for the second and third installments.  Overall, this is worthy of a (cheap) used purchase or a library loan for undemanding fans of escapist fantasy.  (Books like Green Rider by Kristen Britain and The Sword by Deborah Chester came to mind as I read this one.)  However, I would certainly recommend above all of those, if one can tolerate more vivid descriptions of violence and sexual content, A Game of Thrones by George Martin; The Briar King by Greg Keyes; Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb; Rules of Ascension by David Coe; or anything by Guy Gavriel Kay (especially A Song for Arbonne and Tigana).  Two stars 
 This is the worst Methney album I have heard to date. Although it has some great guitar playing in parts most of the CD is totally ruined by monotonous hip-hop beats which,in my opinion, have no place in jazz. Where's the freedom and improvization which jazz is known for? In fact, I'm not even convinced the drummer was playing at all. For most of the set it sounds as if the drummer switched on the drum machine and went out for a smoke. There are a lot of good Methney albums out there, but this is not one of them. Save you money 
 Gee whiz, this is just a not so great book. The problems are much harder than the actual GRE and test abstruse stuff and your knowledge of specific equations. The review in the front I guess is sort of okay in that it lists a lot of differents equations that might be helpful. But the questions are terrible. 
 I agree with "music fan" about this CD. Eden is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't terrible, but it's not very good 
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 I bought these walkie-talkies for my daughter.  Neither the text nor the walkie-talkie part works.  Save yourself the aggravation 
 10 or 20 pages of nice graphs worth copying and keeping on your desk, otherwise really generic, should be kept for reading in the subwa 
 Overall sound quality is poor.  Product does not allow for recording music from cd to casette for Flintstones like me.  Controls are difficult to master.  Taught me a lesson that all stereo appliances should be purchased in store.  
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 This book contains much information I fear was included to justify a second edition, such as discussions of Thai and Islamic calendars, but fails to include a single photo of a rifle to illustrate where and how a marking might be found on a rifle. This is no book for a beginner looking for information on his rifle, but might assist a serious collector seeking marginal data 
 This book should have delivered so much more. I thought that I would get an insiders account of life at Graceland, but I was greatly mistaken...Devoid of real detail and amateurish in the writing...(Reading the entire book will take a maximum of 3hrs..)  
 If you are looking for a textbook you can use to learn statistical methods, this is not the one. The book is most useful for scientists experienced in applying the methods of statistics, who want to sharpen their mathematical apparatus to put their research on a firm foundation. The level of mathematical knowledge required to read the book is not very high but quite demanding as in many cases lots of intermediary calculations are left to the reader, so to properly read the book you have to have a pen and paper to follow the derivation of formulae 
 Reviewer Alianore's opinion "Rather too indulgent of its subject" is a very accurate portrayal of Weir's work. I will try to add something to that near perfect review. (Note: I listened to the unabridged audiobook of "Queen Isabella", 22 hrs on 18 CDs).  The first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. The last third is the worst: Weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of Queen Isabella to the role of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and late-redeemed Just Queen of England.  This book is really "subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization". I do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. It is rhetoric because of the endless "weasel words" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: "Some say", "It has been said", "Many believe", "Therefore we may assume", "It can be inferred" ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. These expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction with Wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved Isabella in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons.  Equally irksome is Weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. She is always 'declaring' for us the contents of Isabella's thoughts. Remarkable gift she has for this. Many times Weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. But then moments later she will portray Isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how Isabella must have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. This isn't historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious agenda.  I don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. The narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. But this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (Other egregious examples of such hagiography include Edmund Morris' "Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" and "Theodore Rex". I could not complete either of those since Morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. Yuck. Really.)  If prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. And much, much less editorial subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. The only way I could enjoy "Isabella" by Weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly, taking it with "several pounds of salt" as the above referenced reviewer advises.  2.5/5 
 I have to be honest.  I bought in to all the hype of mineral make-ups.  My sister uses the bare essentials and her skin looked flawless and she has uneven tones like I do.  I didn't want to pay the price or join the club so I tried Pur MInerals.  I still had to use a "cover-up" under my eyes and blemishes and had to put pur minerals on rather heavy to get the "flawless" look.  But then it looked too powdery.  I started using my regular cover-girl foundation and powder again as I felt it covered better and less heavy.  Just a note, my sister said she still uses a "Cover up stick" when using bare essentials too, but she looked beautiful in it 
 I read the other review about this book. I dont understand how reader enjoy the book. its boring, many twisted plots is unnessery, the end is little surpising but not convincing at all. I read the book 10 days and I just wait to see where the book will become interesting- its not happen. I never feel so boring in reading a book. This is my second book of deaver. I read the vanished man and I very enjoy but this book was inferior.  Maybe one thing in the book was enjoyable and this is the descriptions of Deaver- like the description of the childhood of  Hrubek and of Lis- this was touching and maybe this give me the fews moments of enjoy in the book 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this clown, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 FIVE STARS, NOT TWO....F.F. Bruce is well known and respected far and wide for his honesty as a Christian scholar and apologist. This slim volume, 123 pgs, is true to form despite that as a Christian Bruce has a pre-ordained agenda to defend. Consider his painful honesty in this statement: "indeed, it may be we know nothing certain about the teacher into whose mouth the narrative is put; the story of Jesus as it has come down to us may be myth or legend, but the teaching ascribed to him, whether he was actually responsible for it or not, has a value all its own." How unlike the rabid fundamentalists who insist ever word is inspired of God, error free. He touches on many problem areas, but unfortunately does not develop them as he could have. Some areas not touched are more developed in his contributions to the book "Hard Sayings of the Bible", but even there, some elementary obvious problems, such as the two differing birth accounts of Jesus in Matthew vs. Luke, or the differences in the passion week account of John vs. the synoptics are mentioned in passing, but not developed. "The N.T. documents;are they reliable" thus introduces one to the existence of such areas of controversy, but that is all. It does more to establish the historicity of the accounts as being in the general time period they claim, particularly via Luke, with no less than eighteen historic contemporaries to challenge the reader to test the account validity. He reviews traditional Christian arguments to establish the accounts reliability such as what caused Paul to take such a direct about face from intense persecution to being a foremost leader in Christianity, yet acknowledging in the same chapter that Paul, whose writings are prior to the gospels, is only mentioned in Luke/Acts. Thus while doing a good job to establish the historicity of the New Testament accounts, Bruce also does not hedge on the internal problems of consistency of theology and event accuracy in reporting. He also acknowledges Mark being almost entirely incorporated into Matthew & Luke, and the Q document. Very recommendable due to it's honesty, and a good book for those beginning the subject, but lacking in development in looking at some of the specific events mentioned.    
 i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash. 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 I received this book as a gift, ....after reading it I disposed of it.  I found it to be disrespectful of our Savior.  Lucado suggests that the reason Jesus went to the wedding at Cana was because He wanted to "twirl the bride around the dance floor".  This is the Son of God we're talking about, not some red-blooded human ordinary male.    He uses a lot of space to write short, incomplete sentences that are supposed to grip us, I guess.  It didn't grip me 
 While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as "special" or "crippled," I would never recommend it, because of the title,  which is bad as "The Nig**er Lamb" would be. Get it?  I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called "crippled" and terms like "special" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause  children to be perceived even more as "special" instead of different but equal 
 After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price).  
 It makes absolutely no sense to buy this weak cd because this is the same as the blue print 2 with the exception of 2 songs.In my opinion most of the songs are weak anyways.He made this cd to fool people into buying it and in order to give him more money.This guy does not care about his fans or no hood,so stop supporting him already and save your money.All he cares about is caviar,crystal,jewelry,rides and cash.DO NOT BUY THIS WEAK CD!! 
 One of the most fascinating aspects of salt is that it is hygroscopic.  That is due to its chemical nature, it is slightly cooler than "room temperature".  Consequently, water will form on the surface of salt from the atmosphere if it is even moderately humid (hence the reason why most of us put rice in our salt shakers - to absorb the water salt collects).  You do not have to be a brain surgeon to understand the process.  Imagine my surprise when I found in the very first chapter, Kurlansky waxing on whimsically about how he tried to "cook" all of the water out of his pet salt crystal so that water would not come out of it and dissolve the surface.  I figure that he knows that salt is made up of NaCl (although I now have my doubts) and there is not much room for water in its crystal structure (almost zero water in it).  Here is a guy that has written an entire book on the subject salt.  I presumed when I purchased the book that he would be somewhat of an authority on the subject.  To say the least, I have to question his abilities to write a book on salt based on the fact that he does not have the foggiest idea about one of the most interesting properties of his subject.  Wow.  This is a case of a good writer attempting to write on a subject he forgot to read about.  By the way, a casual search of salt properties on the internet would have given him the correct information.  
 This is probably the worst guide book I have ever owned, and I own a lot of guide books.  I received it as a gift, and I wish I had gotten Lonely Planet, Let's Go, or Rough Guide; even Frommer's would be better.  If all Moon Handbooks are this poor, I have no idea how they stay in business.  It is poorly written--it reads like a seventh grader wrote it.  The language is flowery rather than informative, and when the writers try to include cultural or historical information, they base it on hearsay or simply get bored with writing and leave the reader wondering what the real story is (their section on Garifuna history, for example, ends in 1832--surely the Garifuna have done something in the last 171 years).  Do yourself a favor and buy a different guidebook 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 I picked up "Rock Against Bush - Vol. I" and was really impressed by the quality of the music, the price, and the message.  NOT SO in this case!  More 'mainstream' artists (like No Doubt, and Dropkick Murphy's) but the quality is just not there.  Many songs sound like demo tester recordings that they just handed to Fat Mike to put this CD together.  But of course, many of these bands wouldn't just write/record something just for this comp!  So in that aspect I'm not surprised.  It's just a shame that it shares a name with the 1st edition of this compilation which is far more superior and coherent 
 In terms of being of value to the reader, I think the Iraq Report fails for multiple reasons.  To start with, there is the panel's decision to only look forward.  I felt the main value of the 9/11 report was the fact that it documented events leading to the attack on 9/11, and provided me with quite a bit of context which I would otherwise be unaware of.  I presume the panel's decision to not look backwards was based partly in Baker's desires to fulfill his duty to the public as well as maintain his loyalty to the Bush family.  If this is the case, I think he provided a disservice to both.  With this decision, the report focuses solving the problem going forward.  I think this renders the report irrelevant as: 1.  Few of the recommendations are being actively pursued, which makes their inclusion in the report a moot point. 2.  It may be based in my partial naivety of world politics, but it seems that many of the recommendations are not realistic.  For example, the report stresses the necessity of participation from Iran and Syria in order to secure success - yet my understanding of the situation leads me to expect that Iran has no desire to help.  In fact, the report itself expresses the fact that Iran has some interest in keeping our hands tied in Iraq.  Either way, with the exception of a brief discussion of the current state of affairs, the report does little to inform.  It does do a bit to explain how bleak the current situation is, but that is hardly a revelation.  The recommendations themselves don't appear helpful.  And as time goes on, they are quickly becoming irrelevant.  The only positive that seems to have come from this report is that it has sparked some discussion.  The report itself falls short 
 Worst of all time.  Flanigan and Zingale just defecated on my face with this pile of waste.  My life has been wasted, I feel raped and alone. Watch CNN during election time and gather everything you ever need to know about the material in this book 
 I read a book by Donald Goines about a raped woman and the whole time I was reading it, I was thinking "Why in the world would someone write a book like this?" As much as I love all of Flake's other books, that's the exact same thing I was thinking about this book. The book started off very interesting about how one brother deals with another brother's death, and it reminded me of a cousin which gave me good and bad memories. But then the book launched off into this twisted relationship between the living brother and his father. This book deeply disturbed me during the camping "results" and after that it just became so off-the-wall.  I started questioning my donations to homeless people and who really needs it.  I can't say the book was bad...it just wasn't for me...and definitely an extreme difference from the other books that I've read by Flake 
 A to Z has a big problem in my opinion. It is a very simple children's book with some very cute illustrations of animals (A to Z).  Each animal is engaged in an action that also begins with the first letter of it's name  (e.g. Kangaroos Kissing).  There are lots of made up animals, I'm assuming  to account for the rarity of animals beginning with "Q" and  "X" etc.  The part that I don't like is the fictitious  "Uglybirds" whose action is simply "Being Ugly".  The  illustration that goes along with this so-called ugliness is very  disturbing.  The "Uglybirds" have atypical bird features that  seem intentional.  They are green and purple, and have messed up feathers  and big bulging eyes and are very "Different" from the  "normal" birds in this and other books.  Upon reading this, my  wife and I agreed that we would never repeat this section while reading to  our daughter.  Although I do intend on teaching my daughter about ugliness  (Racism, Violence, contempt, etc.).  I think that it is a quality that  shouldn't be used to describe physical appearance.  When my daughter  encounters a person who is physically unusual, I hope that I have instilled  in her the values to disregard what others might find "Ugly".  I  know that some might think that I'm overanalyzing such an innocent entry in  a child's book, I think that parents need to be more careful about the  messages that they are sending about ugliness 
 As many of the other reviewers have said, Michael Baigent seems determined to make the most of his current Da Vinci Code-related notoriety. That particularly shows through in this book, which unfortunately is just a really lousy read. Baigent has showed previously (Holy Blood, Holy Grail) that he is actually capable of writing in at least a relatively compelling style, even if his contentions are fairly implausible. The Jesus Papers could definitely have done with some of this style - it gets so far off track in many places that its main contention (which is still basically the same as what he presented in Holy Blood, Holy Grail) is almost entirely forgotten by the reader. This is a pity - even though I don't believe for an instant that Jesus somehow survived the crucifixion, I was really interested to see how the story would be put together, and I was sadly disappointed by this effort.  Much of The Jesus Papers retreads some of the same ground covered by Holy Blood, Holy Grail, but without nearly enough detail presented. It then gets severely sidetracked via a brief history of Judaism in Egypt and a discussion of theurgy (where Baigent appears to think he's invented the entire concept that ancient religions purported to involve direct communication with the gods), to end up with a story of Baigent's cave-crawling adventures in Italy. Some of this stuff might have been moderately interesting in its own right, but a lot of it (particularly the bit in the caves) doesn't seem to connect to the main story in any logical manner. The other really frustrating thing is that every important document mentioned is either just tantalisingly out of reach, the subject of a government and/or Vatican conspiracy to hide it from view, in a language Baigent doesn't speak, or a combination of one or more of the above. The "Jesus Papers" themselves are mentioned only briefly, and of course the contents are untranslatable by the author, so they don't actually prove anything at all.  The other complaint I have - and a couple of other reviewers have mentioned this as well - is Baigent's tendency to entirely dismiss the validity of anything written in the Bible, unless it can be bent around to appear to support something he wants to say, in which case it is clearly a reliable primary source. Sorry, you can't have it both ways.  Either way, The Jesus Papers really isn't worth the time. If you want the full theory, read Holy Blood, Holy Grail instead. If you want well-written Biblical scholarship, pick a book at random and there's probably more in it for you than The Jesus Papers provides.  
 This book focuses way too much on disputing irrational self-defeating thoughts such as putting yourself down for not being able to stop drinking. The books answers your self-defeating thinking with such retorts as "prove it" over and over again. This book is also very ambiguous with confusing statements like this one all throughout the book.  QUOTE FROM BOOK... " If you only believe you don't want to be deprived of alcohol, would you then believe that life without it is awful? Usually not. If you believe, however, that you must not be deprived, you can easily think that abstinence is awful. If you only don't want discomfort, would you then believe that you can't stand it? Probably not. You may, however, think that you can't stand it when you believe that you must not have discomfort."  huh......?????? what?????  That's how this whole book is written. Also, there's too much emphasis put on how great a feeling alcohol is. That's dangerous thinking for someone looking to get away from it. For someone who has been drinking for many years, the feeling is not that great anymore. This book put ideas in my head that really weren't there before. It focuses way too much on assuming you put yourself down constantly for not being able to quit drinking. I never really thought like that. There are better books out there. This one just didn't work for me 
 this is an amazing book. buy it right now. however, i would not recommend the paperback edition. it is binded with very inferior glue; two days after i recieved it, the cover had fallen off, and as i read it (quite quickly i might add, as i could not put it down) the pages were literally falling out one by one. i'm not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the paperback, but i can assure you that you're going to want to have this book for a while, so just buy the hardcover 
 The tone of this book is pretty coversational but unorganized.  The information in this book is pretty much out of date.  For example, this book still talk a lot of banner ad which is almost out of the scope in today's ad on web, while talking little or nothing about PPC.  It brings out some good old metric but nothing new.  The technolgy foundation of this book is old and weak and can not reflect and keep up with the current trends.    This book is not efficient in pointing out things. It could be more condensed.  I don't think this is neccessary to tell the whole author's personal story and some other trivial things to explain things. YOu would just need to point out the definition, and how to apply it, and how to interepte it and etc.  This book just includes a lot of unncessary personal story and waste reader's time. If you need a book which is right to the point and nothing more, this book is not right for you 
 I think that this book is pretty boring because it is about a dude that has to use his left foot all the time and it just tells about his life which if you ask me I don't think that he has one 
 This is definitely NOT one of my favorite books about stocks.  The title of the book is a little deceiving, the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits.  Chapters 1-4 are about general info, such as you must buy and sell to make money, don't hold for a long time. You must research the stock before purchase, EPS must increase every year.  I didn't find anything in those chapters that I didn't already know.   Chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell. Once again, the author talks about the obvious; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip.    Chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques, the bull put spread.  This is not something that I use or will use in my trading.   Chapter 12 is the concluding chapter  
 You know the feeling...that feeling of "Oh my gosh, how did I ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end?"  Well, that's what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film.   Unfortunately, because of its all-star cast, although this wouldn't be the first time in movie history where an all-star cast is wasted.  Aside from an interesting peek into the world of Yale's secret Skull and Bones society, a delightful cameo by Joe Pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers, this movie has little or nothing to offer.  It doesn't keep one's attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on, you realize that you don't even care about the characters.  Matt Damon's skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry, especially with the beautiful Angelina Jolie, and he is laughably miscast as a father.  In fairness however, with the script he's been given, it's hard to see how Damon could have done much better.  The pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends.  A huge disappoinment especially since director DeNiro is such a talented actor.  Skip it 
 The author borrows from several world belief systems and tries to pass them off as ancient "toltec" wisdom.  It does contain sprinklings of common sense, but the common sense is offset by impractical application as well as impractical implications.  Furthermore, the author contradicts himself at times.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of Deepak Chopra you will probably like this book as it is in the same vein.  
 After reading The Kite Runner, a story about friendship, loyalty during the adverse times in Afghanistan during the Taliban, I was looking for another read centered on these harsh times in Afghanistan.  The Swallows of Kabul was endorsed as book for those that enjoyed The Kite Runner however, disappointly, other than being set in Afghanistan the books similarities end there.    I appreciated the descriptions about life during the Taliban rule.  The author painted a vivid image on what it would have been like to walk down the street during these times.  You felt sympathic towards the two couples, eventually their lives intertwined but not how you would have expected them.  I was disappointed in the outcome of the story and was left with a feeling that the book was incomplete. 
 It took me about 3 days to figure out the little box with the tiny book IS the book I bought! I thought it's a nice gift came with the item I payed... I guess I'm a Dummy!  I don't understand why so many folks wrote comments under this item while the comments are indeed for another product:-( 
 I must have interpreted the descriptive info wrong. I was expecting a novel, it wasnt. I would call this a ' film review ' Not what i was looking for 
 Bulworth is ostensibly Warren Beatty's brave political satire in which a conservative senator suddenly starts liberally voicing those opinions that the rest of us are supposed to be thinking but are afraid to say. He tells a black church congregation to, "Put away the malt liquor and fried chicken and stop supporting running backs that stab their wives." If that's what you were thinking, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, Bulworth is jaw droppingly bad. To take such a hight position as to attack Beatty for suggesting that black characters need a white powerbroking partriarch to come to his senses before their concerns can be publicly considered is to give Bulworth way more credit than it deserves. It's distinguished from movies that are simply "bad" through its inclusion on the short list of truly dangerous ones. Not content to be racism hiding in plain site, Bulworth's racism is disguised as its own solution. Drug dealers have their transactions justified as the only commercial avenue open to otherwise well-intended African-American youths. Nina (Halle Berry) articulates an informed point, and it's a joke because attractive young black women look funny when they talk smart, like high-grammar versions of Zip Coon. In so doing, Beatty reminds black Americans that no matter what they accomplish, we know who they really are. However limited the potential of the opening premise (Bulworth plans his own assassination for insurance purposes before inevitably changing his mind), the film never approaches the kind of Farley Brotheresque world that would have been its natural destination. The sincerity of the politician's catharsis is hidden from us, both because his new outlook is originally motivated only by the insurance scam and because once Beatty starts rapping his lines, he NEVER stops, making the actor (as opposed to the character) look uncomfortable for the duration. That this movie lured audiences and critics into its didactic spell is astonishing. The film's ambition to be more than a cute little movie while being exactly the opposite reminds this reviewer of Roberto Benigni's embarrassing "Life is Beautiful" from the year before. Both have to be seen to be believed 
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 I got this at Best Buy 4 months ago, its been serviced twice, has a replacement board and there is a 2 month + wait for 2 more replacement boards (digital and scaler).  The picture is lime green, especially on the left side.  The Tech keeps saying all of them (this model) have a green picture so repairs won't work ... so here I sit waiting for repair #3 - by the way, don't get it at Best Buy or use their warranty - its a big battle getting them to replace it or even fix it. FYI This Model wasn't made by Sharp, it was made by a far inferior manufacturer, and the picture shows it.  Anyway, it would be a great set if it wasn't like looking thru Lime Green Jello.    Perhaps the other Aquos models live up to their rep 
 What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! The author does not know the difference between white and albino! The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published! 
 Pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers, whose very existence and relevance is due to that king. What you will get from that kind of writing? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. Sound familiar? Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. Probably she does not care. Americans are lucky that they never had any king. Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS, Iran-Contra, welfare, deficits, funding mujahideens, cozy relationship with Saddam. Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler, happy citizens..."happily lived ever after". Basically, this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer.  Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don't know already. This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80's (which is nothing new in human civilizations). Secondly, she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans. But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan, except all the negative things, like Iran-Contra. In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings, characters of kings and the writings about them 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 James Glassman should apologize for his stupidity, his arrogance, and this book, which lured in a whole lot of amateur investors just as the stock market was about to go bust.  
 I was very disappointed, after having just read Life After Life, a book I found particularly uplifting.  Since I find mirror gazing, and crystal balls, on the same level as Ouija boards, I didn't find this book  especially awe inspiring.  As a matter of fact, I struggled to finish it 
 This book is all right for what it is though I'm not sure why it was written... its information exists elsewhere (notably online) for free, it seems to me, and listings of available Harry Potter merchandise seems a weak addition. I also find it highly suspect that the author gave himself a deluxe 5-star rating... what an odd bit of self-promotion 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 I loved this smoker the first two times I used it but after the third it stopped working as well and by the fifth it didn't work at all.  After examining all the parts, I noticed that the thermostat had burned up around the contact points.  It was under warranty so they sent me a new thermostat but I was forced to pay the shipping!  I used it once and examined the new thermostat and it had already started to burn around one contact point after just one use.  I think I'll go back to my charcoal grill 
 Way too thin for the experienced traveller or collector of offbeat destinations. Liked the old photo postcards but there were no photos of the places that were described.  So photos did not match text.  I think that people who are really into this kind of attraction are sort of graduate level tourists/travellers/pilgrims and this is kindergarten level 
 how many RPG's can this world make??  they're all the same.  open this container, take weapons and health kits from this dead body, use this spell.. KOTOR is no different, sadly.  the combat IMHO is just really boring.  when you see an enemy, the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make.  if that doesn't kill the enemy, your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves.  umm, how many times has this been done before?  if i wanted that, i could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're on now.  all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers.  it's the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack (look it up).  the good thing about games like everquest and world of warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it.  
 I'm sad to say that Suede has hit rock bottom with "New Morning."  There's just nothing here that moves me. No edge to the music or lyrics that I expect from this band that was so darn good in the early 90's and that desperately tried to carry the torch after Butler left. Brett Anderson's voice sounds pretty good. I just wish they had better songs to show it off. They had mixed success on Coming Up and Head Music but this just falls flat IMO.  If you are planning to sample Suede for the first time after reading or hearing about them I would recommend the Bernard Butler era albums "Suede" and "Dog Man Star". The double album B-sides "Sci Fi Lullabie" is fantastic too and lets you taste great tracks full of promise even after Bernard Butler split 
 Sandra Boynton writes songs like someone who has never heard a song before.  The pictures are adorable, sure.  But here's the thing--I don't just want adorable pictures.  Are there a lot of toddler books that *aren't* cute?  If you're going to write a book about the way you feel about your kid and put it in the form of a song, by God that song had better be cute as well.  I challenge anyone to sing the song in this book *AS WRITTEN, without changing the words.  It can't be done unless you're some kind of beat poet or Yoko Ono or something 
 My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., "People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them." That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo 
 This book is not only inaccurate but it contains virtually some of the same text originally published in "Alfa Romeo Spiders" by David Owen in 1982. The similarity of certain passages is just too similar to be coincidence 
 This book did not keep my son's interest at all. He is 2. I was quite disappointed at this book. 
 Clint Eastwood's work (Directed and Produced "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil") has always made an impression on me. Kevin Spacey has always delivered fine acting performances and John Cusack always entertains.   Kelso (John Cusack) gets assigned to cover a party of Williams (Kevin Spacey). The movie ambles along and eventually gets lost. Williams turns out to be gay and kills his lover, the subsequent movie ends up as trial for murder and the surrounding details. A transvestite (Lady Chablis) adds a humerous note to the movie that tries very hard to be stoic. A juju woman, Minerva also dogs the movie doing strange things and having midnight parties at a graveyard. I caught myself laughing several times and then stopped, wondering should I be laughing?   John Cusack was great in "Better off dead" or "High Fidelity". His characterization of Kelso is weak and I keep seeing the same qualities under the surface. His performance in MITGOGAE is unfortunate and poorly placed...it adds another strange layer to a movie that can't decide whether to laugh or cry.   This movie has too many threads loose and ends up being a nervous mess...although the plot and movie itself seem very simple on the surface. [... 
 Simply put, this movie shames the Dragonball Z genre.   This movie has a very poor plot, uninspiring music, lacks drama or emotion, and could be entertaining to only the youngest of children at best.  Avoid this film and, perhaps, send a message to funimation to stop putting out garbage.  
 If you want a book about the highlights (and only the highlights) of Martin Van Buren's public service career then buy this book.  This book had alot of gaps in it.  It kept saying that he was an up and coming star and that he was a political mastermind, but it never once said why he was a star and what manuevers he made to make him a mastermind.  I agree with the other reviewer about Bill Clinton.  This was supposed to be a book about the 8th president not the 42nd.  I found the constant refrences to Bill Clinton to be  out of place.  I guess that the author was drawing on his own experience with a president.  The only reason that I bought this book is that it is a short and concise biography of Van Buren.  I am trying to read a biography of each of the presidents and did not want to spend alot of time reading a 500-600+ page book on one of the lesser known presidents.  I think that the book could have been longer (say about 300 to 350 pages)in order to further detail the career of Van Buren 
 This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts 
 I paid for two tie racks. I received a large box with only only tie rack and a receipt for both. I figured that they would send the second later, but it never happened...  The one rack that I did receive looked fine 
 DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!  Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't).  Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan 
  Wanting something to read on vacation, I hurriedly grabbed the Vintage paperback edition from a dusty shelf in the back of my home office.  The book had belonged to my stepson many years ago. As I thumbed through the pages, it began to fall apart.   I do not recall having to read The Sound and the Fury in college, but I knew it was famous.  Other than that, I came to the book with an open mind but expecting excellence.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed, despite some fine passages, but even those often contained unclear elements.     From the start the story came across as gibberish.  Time jumped around, and characters appeared with little or no introduction.  Gradually a sense of story began to sink in, but by then, what might have been significant in the earlier pages was already lost to me.  I wondered what connection the title had to the story.  I struggled through the entire book, finding later sections to be more coherent, particularly the last, but I was unable to gain a full appreciation of the story.  And I wasn't about to reread the book repeatedly to obtain it.   There seems to be no effort at word economy, particularly in dialogue.  There are endless rambling paragraphs and only four "chapters" for the 400 pages of text.   Worst of all, there is inadequate exposition throughout the book.  There is no introduction telling the reader how the book is constructed, most notably, that it begins with an account by an idiot.  The idea of having a family's story related by several  members if fine, so is writing in stream of conscious, but adequate exposition is needed to orient the reader.     Frustrated during the reading, I thumbed through it and discovered the appendix which described the Compson family.  Most of this material should have been presented early in the book, but even that would not have provided adequate exposition.  After reading the book, I learned that the appendix was added some time after the first edition to help the reader.  That should be a big hint that the book is lacking in exposition.  I believe that good exposition is the responsibility of a writer.   This book is more of a puzzle than a story, and the latter is sacrificed for the former.  The author does not lead you through the story; he throws you into it.  For those who marvel at the literary value of this book, I say, "The emperor has no clothes. 
 I bought this tape for a friend of mine.  They played it once and it "unravelled" and couldn't be used again 
 I am a Rosicrucian and this book is not about Rosicrucians or their Doctrines. As far as I can make out this is from one of those "wantabes".  I found it to be totally useless. If you are truely interested in mystical knowledge, the school still exists and is very welcoming to seekers. ( google AMORC) If you are only seeking a book try The Wisdom of the Mystic Masters by Joseph J Weed.  This book gives a true overview of RC. The focus in on practical self development that can be used right here on the Earth Plane for your evolution.  Its a wonderful life, if you have the right atttiude and are willing to change! 
 Just the same old Warren Commission bashing, but this time illustrated. The author's logic seems to be if the investigators made mistakes (and he  is absolutely unforgiving about that) they must have been part of a  cover-up and therefore there must have been a conspiracy to assassinate  President Kennedy. But, hold the phone...he's not always totally accurate  himself. For example, he implies that the brain, tissue and other matter  from JFK's head did not explode mainly to the front, but the Zapruder film  clearly shows it did. Also, he's sure there was a conspiracy, but doesn't  seem to have a clue who was behind it....is that going to be in a sequel?  If so, maybe I can use this book to get a trade in 
 There are a gazillion poetry anthologies on the market, some better, some worse, some quite comprehensive, some eclectic with a discernible slant.  Billy Collins, a rather entertaining and usually smart poet (although often lacking in depth), has done himself and poetry a disservice here by hurling his name into the crowded field of anthology editors with this haphazard selection that's neither comprehensive nor eclectic -- it's just superficial.  This is one book money is wasted on; for poetry lovers, I would recommend any of the recent editions of the "Best American Poetry" series instead (especially those of 2000 and 2003), or the excellent collection "Poetry Daily: Poems from the World's Most Popular Poetry Website" 
 Very good book. It gives us a real idea of what was and is Latin America (since the enviroment is very much dinamic the last/last issues are not incorpoated in the book). Worth 
 Corny beyond words, only one good track "Fly With Me" the rest, I dislike very.   I'd reccomend Avril Lavigne Ashlee Simpson Or Even N'Sync But not this trash! 
 I agree with most reviewers.  This coffee maker is a piece of junk.  The few cups that I made were the worst tasting coffee ever 
 I bought the CD because I was looking for piano music and this one was highly recommended by reviewers. Well, it sure is one boring piece of work! I somehow missed reference on the music style. So, to you all who may be doing the same mistake: it is a blues music for bars. Nothing great nor special about it really. It has something specifically American about it that I find difficult to relate to: too common, too simple, too simpleminded, too shortcoming. Sorry, but using piano for instrument doesn't make the music special; the melodies could have been played on harmonic or accordion instead and sold as folk-music 
 i hate to sh*t on underground rap but funcrusher plus is the only good thing el ps ever done. his flow isnt catchy, i cant understand him, his beats are non melodic. someone will say im too dumb to appreciate him. whatever. there are plenty better mcs in the underground than this:mf doom, murs, c rayz walz, dilated, beatnuts, non phixion, necro and pretty much everyone makes better music than ginger boy. hes a geek with a ginger mustache and he sips ammoni 
 Lindsell appears to believe that true Christianity requires (regardless of its date or provenance) a belief in a modern doctrine of inerrancy. Perhaps of some limited use for those wondering how the biblical text could be taken in such a way (quite creative at times) but otherwise just grim stuff 
 THis book is so wack.  I should use it for toilet paper.  What a moron.  Survival of the fittest my a$$!  What an ignorant fool for writing such garbage.  Do not buy it 
 In order to tell the tale, a movie in the range of three hours would have been required. Instead, you are given about half of that (102 minutes). Instead of a solid bridge from start to finish, you are given stepping stones, some of which are covered in moss. To make matters worse, the actors seem over-rehearsed and uninspired. In some cases, the actors may have been miscast. The bottom line is this: READ THE BOOK. If you want to experience this story, there is no shortcut, you must read the book. I am confident you will find the written story a fine one indeed; worthy of reading 
 Harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals, and her bright friend's big plan is to set off a smoke bomb (incendiary) during a school assembly. Either one will get a kid expelled, arrested, and in the newspapers. Not amusing ! Then there's Golly telling her about the virtues of lying. If there is a lesson that could be drawn (which the movie misses), Harriet's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing, because she is showing the sort of behavior that (in a kid 2 years older) would be take as a possible symptoms for other bad things like self-mutilation or bulemia, as in the movie "Thirteen. 
 Although I read the book to the end, it was a struggle.  The characters were superficial, the background descriptions unsatisfying and the denouement not particularly gripping.  Having been spoilt by Lindsay Davis's wonderful Falco series, I was hoping for something more evocative of daily life in Ancient Egypt but I never got a real sense of anything in this story.  I won't be reading any more adventures of Lt Bak 
 The book was a total deception. Confusing spreads, and not so good interpret of the same spreads. The author complicates, intricate and elaborate too much all the spreads...beginning with something and ending up in something else. If you can answer something with 8 cards, why use 15 cards?  Past life's readings were not treated with the seriousness, mystic and reverence the theme requires.  I had designed better past life's spreads than hers. I have been reading and studying the tarot for 10 years, so I`m not a beginner. Sorry for Lewellyn, they should have taken more care in a book for past life's spreads. This is a very rich theme that can be treated in more creative and accesible ways.  The author is not a tarot specialist, she explores with spreads, with awful results. She is not convincing, and the book lets you with a salty taste,as you keep reading trying to find if it gets better at the end...but it fails to meet your expectations.  I bought the book because it was recommended by Mary Greer, but it was a total deception. It seems that Mary Greer writes the forwarding of tarot books to help in their selling's, but it is not a guarantee that the book is good. It is very SAD that this is happening...as I respect and admire Mary Greer, as an author. But from now on, I will not rely on her recomendations...as she recomends almost every tarot book from Lewellyn publications. 
 Oh did this one stink.  Convoluted and confusing, the buildup to the conclusion was positively endless.  I didn't laugh once 
 While the author provides a good, concise overview of NFP techniques, she makes some assertions that are not supported by scientific evidence.  For example: 1) Trying to conceive immediately after discontinuing the Pill often results in miscarriage...FALSE.  The main reason many gynos recommend waiting is so you can better determine when you are ovulating, as you may be anovulatory for a few cycles post-Pill. 2)Chapter on regulating cycles with light...references research back in the 70s.  If this truly had merit, I think the body of work would be greater. 3)Chapter on choosing the baby's sex - relies on the Shettles method, also from the 70s.  It has since been proven that his assertion that "X" sperm are slower moving and larger and "Y" sperm are faster moving and smaller is incorrect.  The only somewhat reliable sex selection techniques involve laboratory assistance.  There are better NFP books out there, namely: "Natural Birth Control Made Simple" Kass-Anesse/Danzer (still a little preachy) "The Fastest Way to Get Pregnant Naturally" Williams (if this is your goal, if you're looking for contraception, maybe not the best! 
 I am also a longtime subscriber, and I am quite outraged at the new changes that have been made with the magazine. I have written a letter to the editor containing my list of grievances, if you will (I would hope they would be redressed but they will probably ignore me). Anyway, please read:  I am a current subscriber, and was quite suprised by Discover's new look (to all reading this review on Amazon.com: Amazon.com does NOT display the updated version of what Discover currently looks like). I didn't quite care for it, but as long as the material stayed the same I was going to be allright with it. Unfortunately, the articles in Discover have degenerated into "Top 20 things you didn't know about..." lists, piles of trivia, some sexual humor and editorializing on recent news. Sure, reading about gay astronauts may be a little humorous. Is it appropriate for what Discover stood for or what I have expected from this magazine? I would disagree. Occasionally there is an intelligent article. The cover story still seems up to par with the stories from the Old Discover. I really did once enjoy this magazine and it was the most expected item to arrive in my mailbox. I've kept all my copies from the last five years in the best condition I possibly could because I truly did enjoy reading them, and still do. Maybe this new Discover is for a "new generation" or meant to lure in younger or less mature readers, but I think the change in articles has taken a turn for the worse. I think the ordinary person, the "lay man" if you will, would appreciate at least intelligent articles about new, interesting and groundbreaking discoveries in the scientific community. I remember the String Theory article (I forget which issue exactly) as one of the most well-written articles on that topic.It was very exciting, and most importantly it [i]got me interested in the science[/i]. I doubt I will ever see anything that good from Discover magazine again. I'd really hate to give up on this magazine: all I ask is for the old Discover back. 
  I was looking forward to this book for awhile because no one had really gone into special effects compositing specifically before. This book has nice full color photos, and that's the only truly appealing thing I can really say. There really aren't any tutorials in this book to follow. You recieve lots of advice, and some of it is helpful but there are no example files for you try what he suggests. There are all these full color photos for you to see what happened to an image, but without the image you cannot try to replicate it. I had to resort to finding images off the net that were as close as I could come, and of course the differences were enough that it wasn't very helpful. The whole chapter dealing with fire basically tells you that you can't do good realistic fire in AE so look so go make your own or look somewhere else, kind of a waste. Very dissapointed, I learn by doing and yet there is no real practicle application in this book for me to learn by. 
 This is my first Amazon.com review. I was compelled to do so because of Denis Johnson's short novel. It is a quick read, one-sitting. This is my first introduction to the writer. While I enjoyed the underlying structure: expansion and collapse of the narrative I found the story itself very frustrating. We read of academic life and its random structural changes - money for some projects, not others. Very little interaction between professor and students. There is an elusive sprite who (surprise?) makes money as a caterer, art class model, stripper, artist, who is also part of a pseudo-new-age religon for the singing? The main character's introversion is severe throughout, but then turns to direct observation with the reader, as if we are the character's confident - it doesn't work. Ultimately, I feel like this work was an exercise by the writer that got him to another, better place - based on some passages I'd recommend the writing - avoid this example 
 If you are prepared to invest a lot of time into your guidebook, there is a lot of information contained within Insight's Rome City Guide. It has detailed essays and beautiful photographs of 15 main areas within Rome. That's it for the positive.  Overall, I found the book boring and difficult to use. The key problems are: 1. The good information is buried. It is not the sort of book you can pick up, jump to a section, and get good information. It will take you a while to find what you are looking for, and then you have to read a lot of words.   2. The writing style is very dry - similar to a textbook. All too often when reading this guidebook I drifted off and would lose my place on the page.  3. The maps are difficult to use and hard to read. I never got my bearing of Rome until I bought another book.  I gave up on this book after a while and went and got the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide to Rome. The maps are better and it's easier to read. In fact, the DK guides are an absolute pleasure to read. 
 In spite of the hard work that has evidently gone into the writing of this book, the results are variable.  Too much irrelevant material gets a look in, and too much tedious commentary about Mrs Bee's after-life.  I feel somehow that Ms Hughes wanted to write something more meaningful, but was stumped by lack of firsthand evidence 
 Although this book helped me comprhend the symbolism of Animal Farm, i often found that it gave away future parts of the book.  For example, i would read the comentary of chapter three, and it would give away a critical event that comes on much later in the book.  In addition, i did not think that it interpereted all the symbolism that Orwell used.  My advise if you are going to read Animal Farm, is to try a different source of notes 
 i would have liked a more real story in this dvd 
 This work performs the useful function of paying some attention to Mrs. Yeats and Yeats' domestic life, but is essentially a mediocre and sloppy piece of work, full of hasty, half-baked judgment, and occassional smarmy  irreverence. Roy Foster's biography, though long, is infinitely to be  preferred 
 My daughters ages 4 and 9 own this dvd and don't like it.  They also own the billy blanks tae bo for kids and love it.  My 9 yr. old especially likes the tae bo better.  I bought this thinking that it would give them another kind of workout, but they don't want to do this one at all.  I thought they would, and I'm sure as the other reviews have stated, love it but they didn't.  I guess it just depends on the child 
 I have known Tina for many years and lived with her even, her music is all the same and never seems to progress in any other direction other than , neo-folk, high register, she is better off staying in coffee houses 
 This book represents literally the worst scholarship I have ever seen.  It makes no pretense of careful, thorough, or new research into its subject, but relies almost exclusively on two secondary sources--both in English, both still in print.  Its dependence on Jack Beeching's book on the same subject is so thorough that it renders this book completely superfluous.   I feel like my time and money were wasted on this when I could have skipped it entirely and headed directly to the source.  In addition to its total lack of new insight into the subject, the book seems not have benefitted from editorial oversight prior to publication.  In one chapter, the same quotation is used in two different contexts, citing two different sources, with no attempt at explanation.  Indeed, I was surprised to find several ungrammatical sentences scattered throughout, as if an early draft had somehow made it to the presses.  If this was a term paper, it would have been handed back for a rewrite.   There is no excuse for something of such poor quality sitting on bookstore shelves.  It is insulting to the reader that this book was ever allowed to the see the light of day.  The authors ought to have their academic credentials revoked 
 You have this camera case listed under accessories for the Panasonic DMC FA20PP Lumix Camera. The camera does not come close to fitting in this case. The camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 It [wasn't good]. It's about a man walking on a roof fell off a roof. this man ate a piece of pie in a dream he had after he died and turned nto a ghoast. After that the pie came out of his dream,woke him up in real life,attacked him,and then killed him. Then his dead spirit which makes know sense because he's already dead sinks into the ground. Then the pie shoots it's self 
 I have taken yoga classes for years and it is nice to see the medical doctor values such a art to help back pain suffers.This book is okay for someone new to yoga and has back pain but it is over 10 years old. needs to be updated. I recommend other up to date books on the market today that shows the reader all forms of exercies to use to over come back pain 
 This book is very scientific and precise, but it is not easy to read. 
 We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and  inability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her view of women isn't much better in that they are supposedly the poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a  distasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is the  aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing  victim to only get children and love in return.If she can't see the pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers. Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why some people bother to read such books because it's a waste of  trees,paper and time! Another problem is she makes it sound as though women who  like intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as though she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse. She tries to make very subjective material sound like it's  supposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!! Very dangerous book 
 Had the printer for just over a year with light use.  I started getting numerous error messages, then the printer would stop printing in the middle of a page or I couldn't get it to print at all.  Spent over two hours in a hp chat session that made little sense - (was told to push buttons my printer doesn't have, and when I told the rep that nothing happened after a procedure to re-set the printer, she replied "great, that means it worked.")  Was then offered the option of getting the printer serviced for $290, the same price I paid for it a year ago, or upgrading to a C6180 for $300, which is $20 more than the current price on Amazon.  This product has been a waste of time, money and energy 
 This is a reprint of a previous book.  While the text is fairly good, it makes references to many illustrations which are not in the reprinted edition.  Therefore, I would not recommend it 
 I just bought and began reading "Portrait of Johnny" by Gene Lees, and I am furious.  What a lazy book.  Page seven:  "Whether Lerner set the words to Loewe's music or Loewe set the music to Lerner's words I don't know."  HOW HARD CAN THAT BE TO FIND OUT?  Page eleven:  "And to this day I do not know if Johnny Mercer knew that Patton was his distant cousin."  WELL, DID HE EVER MENTION IT TO HIS DAUGHTER OR ANYONE ELSE YOU INTERVIEWED?  Page fourteen:  "...Mercer grew up...at the intersection of Lincoln and Gwuinnett Streets.  Street names in Savannah predate the Civil War: the Lincoln in question is not Abraham, and Button Gwuinnett was Georgia's delegate to the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence."  AND FOR WHOM IS LINCOLN STREET NAMED?  I read a positive review of this book and was looking forward to reading it. I am ready to throw it out the window, and I want my money back.  Kathy Moor 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son.  The nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails.  I use my own Revlon clipper especially since I am comfortable with the feel of it already.  The thermometer is sooo... slow, I get make an educated guess faster.  The case is cute and I am sure the medicine droppers are ok...haven't needed those yet.  But all in all, I threw half of this kit in the garbage 
 Unable to get a message to Amazon any other way.  The last two cds are bad, can't play them on my cd player.  I have sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure, but no one has contacted me.  Very disappointed in the Customer relations of this cd compan 
 Its quite simple, Ive been aDJ for 25 years and have listen to thousands of people and their reactions to anything but the originals............They notice and they talk about it. Especially when they are classic party songs....It would be like hearing a classic Elvis song....They would say "Thats not Elvis" by then its too late......a lasting impression.  www.DJetc.com / Nashvill 
 I found this book to be quite interesting and insightful. However, I was turned off initially by the assumption by the author that the readers of her book were "European American", which I am not.  Throughout  the book she wrote about how European American women might relate to and  view Kwan-Yin, seeming to forget that other non-European women are both  literate and spiritual and may have an interest in and reverence for Kwan  Yin 
 ...because after this album their careers are over. Don't get me wrong, I never thought of Good Charlotte as a great band. To me they were always a fun band and I'll always go to 2002's The Young And The Hopeless whenever I feel like listening to some fun music. Good Morning Revival simply misses the mark everywhere. After listening to this album I can't help but think that they spent the last few years having their manhood shredded by woman after woman. Each song is a complete and total whinefest that in the end gets really old. How redundant can a band be with any one theme?   Not only does the album cry sissy but they even ripped off Coldplay on two of the decent tracks. Don't believe me? Listen to "Where Would We Be Now" and tell me that they did not rip off Coldplay's "Speed Of Sound." Also, take a listen to "Beautiful Place" and notice how they blatantly ripped off Coldplay's "Clocks." The funniest part of this whole album is the last track "Face The Strange." In this track they acknowledge that they need to grow up and embrace change but it is evident nowhere in this album.   Good Charlotte needs to get down on their hands and knees and pray that the teenagers and pre-teens of America keep album sales strong enough to get a shot at another album. Quite frankly, after such a long layoff and such a poor "revival" I'm betting that we'll never hear from these guys again. 
 I am a HUGE Samiam fan.  Last of all my friends to pay any attention to this band in years.  Thought Astray was just so-so, with a few great songs and a lot of filler. Had a feeling that that was going to be their final record, and that it would probably be a smart move to quit while ahead.  This new record is horrible.  Recording is rough too.  Jason's voice is long gone.  Save yourself the money and buy any older record.  They are all amazing 
 This is a solid case, but after some months of use, I have 2 complaints.  One is that the stylus falls out because of the way the case is designed.  The other is that while the soft interior is protective, it has begun to deteriorate, leaving "dust" on the Ipaq.  There are few hard cases out there, however, so I would purchase this again if I needed one 
 Superficially this books appears to be a treatise on the subject. But a more careful look reveals a lack of motivation, justification, or proof for any idea presented. Indeed there are no direct references to other authorities so as to allow the reader to either confirm a purported fact or take a deeper look at a particular point. What results, instead, is a compilation of alleged "facts" (none are proved and all are stated without proof) in cook book style. Even more, some of the formulas are not verifiable by spice simulation, and even conflict with other formulas bearing on the same issue. The overall impression of this book is that it is a hodge podge of ideas drawn from other sources, without any coherent theme. In the end Johnson performs a disservice to his readers by promoting the idea that the subject is nothing more than "black magic." It is not, and there are many other books and application notes stretching back decades which bear testimony to this fact. The very essence of the subject is a study of the effects of parasitic elements which become dominant in the presence of high edge rate signals. In this regard high speed digital design draws more heavily upon analog design, with a particular emphasis on rf design techniques. By leaving out all derivations, the reader is never truly educated on this subject and is thereby left in the dark 
 Worst map/purchase ever made, never again.  Look like Mexico City is totally incomplete & I know Mexico City.  This was purchased for a friend who is traveling to the city of Mexico 
 I read this book in about half an hour and was not impressed.  It is all just everyday common sense, no "unleashing of power" here.  The "Keys" described in this book are normal things that most people do who are good at what they do and take pride in their work and their life.  If you don't already do these things naturally I seriously doubt this book would change your behavior.  No "life-changing ideas" here. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for this book. Save your money. 
 The Tenant is a film that wastes time and loses viewers.  Long stretches of time where nothing happens, something quickly happens, then we are back to the monotonous pace - excruciating to watch.  Never have I checked and checked to see how much of a film was left.    The story sounds really good and gripping - tenant moves into the apartment of a woman who committed suicide.  He feels something is going on with the building, the manager, and the other tenants.  Slowly, he begins to identify with the dead girl.  But the pace is so slow.  The main character, played by Roman Polanski, is so boring and unsympathetic that you wish he would just jump out of the window and get it over with.  He has a beautiful girl interested in him - why?    The end - which I won't reveal - is absurd instead of unsettling, mainly because of the duration of time it took to get to that point 
 The only good thing about this book is that it was short. Even in writing about a great man with incredible contributions to our country, Gary Hart repeats himself over and over and over and over again. OK, the Monroe Doctrine is important, I GET IT!  I read about 2 or 3 presidential biographies per month and I cannot remember a book as bad as this. If you want a quick view of James Monroe, you can read the first chapter and skip the rest but this book is not good for more than that 
 As a volunteer at an animal shelter, this was the book to read for our book club.  I was sorely disappointed.  Although I know Mr. Foster's heart is in the right place, the start of the book begins with his observations of dogs that he didn't help - which was quite disturbing.  Additionally, I found his writing skills poor.  His lack of explanation as to why, for example, his dog was vomiting blood, left you hanging.  The book just ends, no real ending to the story.  As I said, I was very disppointed 
 This is the first movie review I have ever written.  I wish I could have been doing something more pleasurable than watching this epic...like poking myself in the eye with an ice pick or lighting myself on fire.  Wait, it gets worse...I actually bought this piece of camel dung..  ..  I am going to loan it to a prick at work that I hate!  No, I'll give it to him and refuse to take it back...  Hurry, go see it! 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 (2.5 Stars) When I first began reading WH, I was turned around a bit on the chracters as well some language styles, so I decided to cheat and check out the list of characters that was in the back. I soon realized how unhelpful it was and very disappointed by its lack of contributing nothing more than the obvious. What I mean is, instead of helping me deciphor who was who and in relation to one antoher, in which a geneology would have been better, they merely gave very short snippets of description that was actually in the text itself. I got through all the relations by my friend who supplied me with a genology chart.  There were also endnotes that state the obvious as well and it was very tedious to have to keep flipping back to see if they would clarify anything. One character speaks in special Englilsh dialect that was difficult to read and understand. The author suggests that you just need to read it aloud and you'll understand it. Granted, that's true, but a translation in the endnotes would have been nice too.   There is a timeline at the beginning, which is nice but I'm not sure what the point of it was and it seemed randomly placed. At the back again, there is a short discussion on the motifs/themes of the book. It was somewhat enlightening but they point out things the reader would have picked up anyway. But, one thing that was really interesting was that there was a short essay on how the book was received from Bronte's time as well into modern times. The short bio at the beginning was done well though.  The overall language of the book was modernized while still keeping certain dialec and stylistic elements of Bronte that didn't really work well. It was very awkward at times but nevertheless, very readable.   Someone who wants a less intimidating introduction to Bronte or any classical works will find this book helpful (& others in this series). But for those of you who are used to a more strict classical interpretation with a more academic flavor, this is NOT the book for you. You will find it somewhat dull, unchallenging and tedious. The language is not very sophisticated nor reminiscent of the linguistic era (which I enjoy, you may not, so...)  The STORY of WH was fascinating. I both hated it and loved it. There were times when I just wanted to chuck the book across the room because I found it SO vile, the charcters so enraged and violent, selfish and horrible. I haven't feld that way since I read Ann Rice's 'Memnoch the Devil'. I've never read a more passionate and fierceer book; and while I read, I was both dreading it yet couldn't wait to see what happened.   I read this several days ago and I'm still buzzing from it. The confusion of the names is a very interesting device, clever and sly. Bronte was ahead of her time, fusing both the gothic novel with supernatural, dramatic and tragic styles. The evolution of 3 generations was so complex yet the progression of each was so vivid and stand out on their own. I haven't decided if I hate or love Heathcliff and Catherine, if even I can forgive them for their nature. And the wonderful way that Bronte wrote was not just the language of words but in the way she used the wilderness of the moors as a description of their wild selves.  
 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
 Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice 
 I want a complete and diverse needlecraft library and I was pleased to see this book listed.  But the reviews and book descriptions led me to believe it would be innovative and new.  It's not.  The layout of the book, the photos and the illustrations are excellent.  The patterns are mundane. I don't use novelty yarns, at all - so I knew I would be adapting the patterns using merinos, silks and wool blends.  The problem with that plan is the book is all about the novelty yarns.  Once you take away the novelty there is nothing left but basic plain crocheted vests, ponchos, shells and a few accessories.  I like easy, I like fast, but I also like style.  I was looking for a new take on the square, a way to put crocheted squares together in a new and exciting way.  I did not find it with this book.  I will gift this book to someone who appreciates novelty yarns in all their glory - because it is a beautiful book and deserves a good home where it will be used and appreciated 
 The rhythms in this music are so monotonous, songs go on and on and on, with no direction, as if the songwriter didn't know how to end the song.  Very disappointed in this because an intelligent person recommended this album and I expected much much better.     Just a bunch of over-drugged and over-sexed punks, no role models here!    I don't recomend you buy this one.   
 If you love "A Prairie Home Companion," it is fun to watch top stars perform with Garrison, and I admired how subtly he wove Lake Wobegon stories into the dialogue. However, if you expect movies to have plots, this flick isn't for you. No discernable rising action or climax, and the resolution was limp, as if Garrison ran out of ideas to tie up the direction he took the material. I wish GK had instead presented his annual joke show. Don't let the movie fool you if you've never heard "A Prairie Home Companion." It is a 100% entertaining radio show. The songs in the movie are well-performed and I was impressed with the peformances. Woody Harrelson, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin can sing 
 There are many reviews of this book that are on target.  I will keep mine short.  The author of the book is hostile to Christianity and hides behind supposed scholarship.  The book is largely biased opinions.  If one strains, one can find some useful information.  For anyone who wants to see the author's bias most clearly, get a copy of the book and look at the last page of the last chapter.  There, the author puts forth such an absurd anti-Christian, anti-Bible, and anti-American vision that the rest of the book is put clearly into the context from which the author writes.  I read the whole book, looking for a few nuggets, but finding few.  My recommendation is that this book is not worth reading and certainly not worth buying 
 It appears as if Ian has gone out of his way to make this book boring.The material in the book is superb but its presentation is rather poor 
 As a purchasing professional, I turned to this book to gain insight to new or advanced purchasing practices that might help me in my work and I was very enthusiastic about the book when I began reading it.  Instead of new knowledge, I found repetitive stories about the mass production environments in the automotive and related industries.  Although some new thoughts or ideas were presented, I did not feel as if this book taught me anything novel or cutting edge.  It is simply a repeat of purchasing concepts that can be found in many other operations or supply chain books flavored with managerial buzz words and the self-glorifying personal success stories of the authors and the companies they work for.  If you work in a job shop environment or for a small to medium size business, this book is virtually useless.  If you are in a huge mass production environment with a large budget, it might be of some value, but my guess is that you would already be familiar with the concepts presented 
 An official Library Weekly book review.  EXCERPT: If you are like most people, you are struggling, without much success, to get the yield back into your savings. The places to which you are turning are not producing much relief.  RATING:  2 of 5  REVIEW: The 16% Solution is supposed to be a guide on how to invest in tax liens; however, as you turn the pages, you find that it seems to cut back and forth with fictional characters and then law-based jargon. There is an attempt by the author to deliver a point, which is commendable, but there are many parts of the book that needs editing.  While this is an acceptable guide to investing in tax lien certificates, it would not be a first pick.  OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. The Beginner's Guide to Real Estate Tax Lien and Tax Deed Auctions [ISBN 0978834607]  2. Profit by Investing in Real Estate Tax Liens [ISBN 0793195179 
 I was tremendously disappointed in this book.  The cost of $35-50 is definitely a complete rip-off for what you get from the author.  All you need to do is refer to pages 227-246.  Those are the pages that represent the bibliography.  I actually was so pissed off after reading this book that I counted them.  In total the author referenced the words and work of 488 author people.  There are only 223 pages of text and 6 chapters in the book.  I am certain you can do the math but I'll do it for you.   There are on average more than 2 references per page and over 80 per chapter.  It's as though the author has never had an original thought of his own.  If I wanted to hire somebody to go out and look up the work of other people I would have done that.  I was expecting the author to use his own first-hand knowledge and experience in order to help educate and inform others such as myself about the process.  Instead, what I got was something a high school student would do while trying to complete a report for homework.  My only question is who is less ethical:  the author or the publishing company that let this slide through the screening process.  For all of those that gave this book 5 stars I can only guess that you don't enjoy actually reading 
 I must confess I did not read the entire book word for word because it struck me as being pure common sense. I would not recommend the book unless you are just starting out in life and do not have much experience dealing with people 
 I'm pretty new in the trading world also but I have to go with the crowd and say that this was the absolute worst book ever on day trading. Whatever you do, don't buy this one! Get a toni turner book or something, but NOT this one. Alot has changed since 1999 so it's understood how some techniques can't be used anymore, but this was garbage even back then.   He repeats everything hundreds of times throughout the book, "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread"  "you are the middleman" "you are the middleman"  In a bookstore read the first page of the foreword, it says that he was signed the book deal(1st one) even before he wrote it as a 23 year old. Proof enough that it's hot garbage 
 Parts of this book were fairly interesting, but the first chapter was awful.  It took a while to get used to her writing style which is very disjointed and rambling.  I found myself asking questions about her and her garden which were never addressed in the book.  Allen Lacy is a much better gardener/philosopher/writer 
 Lured into purchasing the book by its phenomenal popularity in the US (I studied theology in Europe), I regret the money I spent on it. I found the author's portrayal of events not outright aggressive. Rather, he subtly undermines certain aspects of honest history and integral faith applying a modernist type of historical-critical method. Buy the Teuchle Bihlmeyer History, St. Eusebius, or Crocker's Triumph instead 
 I just bought this book for my son, only to find out that the entire book is based on the J2SE 1.3 SDK which was end-of-lifed in December 2006 (for Windows and Linux) and is no longer available, so the book is USELESS (unless you happen to have a Solaris 8 box sitting around)!  AMAZON - STOP SELLING THIS BOOK!  OH - SORRY - you can get the 1.3 SDK for HP-UX if you have one of those 
 After completing my first year of law school, I really wonder why so many professors use this textbook.  More than half the people I spoke with in my class thought the casebook's usability was poor or worse.   Property is not a difficult class, aside from future estates and related issues (Rule Against Perpetuities).  The hardest thing about property is knowing the jurisdictional views on various aspects of property law, and this casebook does only an OK job highlighting that.  It is basically a lot of memorization and the learning of that material could have been substantially aided by organizing the book differently.  Additionally, many of its cases are not sufficiently edited, thereby necessitating that one read through too much irrelevant information to get to the legal issue.  My other case books are much more balanced on this issue.    As a last note, the production quality is lower than what I would expect for its price.  The paper chosen and the fair reproduction of what photos exist in the book contrast strongly with its price.    I suppose this sounds like a laundry list of complaints, but the book compares poorly to my other casebooks, simply stated 
 It is necessary to note that this book is required for CADC licensure in some certification programs.  As such, it is so poorly written and organized, I am finding it difficult to get through it. I am disappointed to have paid significant money for what is assumably quality research and information about substance use and abuse, presented in a manner that is careless and disorganized.  There are innumerable grammatical errors and the author lacks focus and consistancy within paragraphs.  It is inexcusable to read a "textbook," where basic sentence structure and writing is neglected.  While the information contained is assumably valid and of great value, its presentation is lacking at best.  I hope that future additions are more cost effective and adhere to a higher standard of professional educational writing. 
 It is small and light weight, probably perfect for hikers. I think the battery is supposed to last 5-8hrs away from the car. The software is pretty versatile and it lets you do a lot. My biggest complaint is that it is very slow. I'll be typing in a name to help filter my destination choices, and if it is more than 5-10 miles away, it takes forever for it to show up. I end up not knowing if the destination (say McDonalds) doesn't exist nearby, or if I just spelled it wrong. Additionally when I pass up a turn I don't want to make, it goes into "Recalculating...". Then it finishes in time to tell me to turn right just as I'm driving through the intersection...."Recalculating..." again. I think she does it on purpose. This product would probably be fine for anyone who drives at half the speed limit 
 This more like a high school paper gone wrong than a serious book for adults. Typical of the nonsense circulating around lately regarding Hydrogen as an alternate fuel.  Poor science, terrible reading......  Does not factually deal with the real issues such as cost of distribution, storage and gasification.  An insult to any reader with a brain 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 In this book, Robert Kaplan makes a case for a revival of Fascism. As in the 1930s, the world is to turn its back on normal morality in favor of the ends justify any means and to adopt National Darwinism. The book idolizes the strongman leader and the arbitrary use of military force unconstrained by a civil society.  He laughs at Jewish and Christian concepts of morality. They are for fools and children. The ethos he reaches for calling it "Pagan" is in truth not that at all. Rather than presenting anything about leadership, he presents domination. Morality is for idiots and all true leaders are supposed to recognize that life (and government) is nothing more than a struggle between men for greatness and survival. To be moral is to be a fool that will be crushed by the real leaders of the world.  Kaplan would have been right at home in Imperial Japan, Fascist Italy or up on the platform with Franco. The book isn't worth reading and I would not recommend it to anyone 
 ANANSI BOYS by Neil Gaiman Review by Nickolas Cook  	For those familiar with Gaiman's past work, like me, you've probably come to appreciate his intelligent humor, story telling ï¿½lan, and philosophical bent on the human condition.  With "Anansi Boys" he again proves all of those qualities and more. 'Fat' Charlie Nancy is the disgruntled son of the forgotten African god, Anansi (we met him in Gaiman's masterpiece to date, "American Gods"), a mischievous spider deity, who stole all of the stories of creation from Tiger, the dark and violent god of blood and death.  'Fat' Charlie receives news that his father has passed away and rushes from England to Florida to find his father was no mere human.  And as if that's not bad enough to ruin his day, he also discovers he's got a lost brother called Spider.  Given the incantation to draw his brother to him by a trio of old hags, much like MacBeth's cackling witches, he gets more than he bargained for when his impishly suave brother appears and begins to steal his life, his career, and his fiancï¿½ right out from under him. Gaiman does mythology like no other author, dragging us from one world to the next in search of honor and love, making the cosmic drama of gods more human.  But what he does even better is examine familial love and commitment to a calling higher than one's self.  For 'Fat' Charlie soon finds that he can't ignore his heritage anymore than he can his brother.  He is part of the pantheon, whether he fancies it or not, and, after a bargain made in angry frustration, must battle to save his bloodline from eternal death. Gaiman's prose is top notch, fast paced, edited to the essentials, with enough descriptive passages to make the story blossom in full, but not enough to stifle the pace.  There are some rather out of place scenes with the spirit of a murdered woman that tend to dishevel the almost perfect fairytale quality of the story, but given that all's well that end's well, it can be forgiven. "Anansi Boys" doesn't have anywhere near the broad canvas feel of "American Gods" and the extraordinary "Neverwhere", but fits nicely along side his "Stardust".  It's a fun read, full of humor and great characters, but his fans may miss that mythical cosmic sense provided by  some of his other fiction.  --Nickolas Cook 
 This book is a bit of a disappointment. Although the second half of the book is a photographic section of launch vehicles and has some illustrative value, the first part, which should have been a technical description with illustrations/drawings is incomplete as many launch vehicles are not covered (focus is on U.S. manned launch vehicles mainly- and the shuttle is not described). I guess there is too much information that needs to be included but not enough space in a 100-page booklet. A Launch Vehicles space guide should have come in a two-set package or in a larger book 
 This would have been a great disc, but all the trailers are ruined by the presence of "SWV" in the bottom-right in blockly letters.  My eyes hurt after watching the entire thing in one sitting, then I broke the disc and gouged my eyes out with it. I've got a few other Something Weird discs that include some trailers and other neat stuff, but those too are ruined in the same way.  The main movies on the discs are presented clean, but I still can't support a company that does this.  Broadcast TV has become unwatchable in the same way, do we really want to tell home video companies that this practice is acceptable? Shame on Image for agreeing to distribute material that is desecrated in this manner 
 I don't know about this book!  I wouldn't recommend i 
 This book was very disappointing.  Aside from the fact that the elements would be very expensive to produce, the designs lacked any strength.  Each project seemed to be more about the designer's ego than about the client.  Additionally, the book's  "icon" layout was cumbersome and meant having to refer to the legend much too often. Granted, some books are more useful than others, but I have never purchased a book that hasn't given me some bit of inspiration, no matter how small... until now.   I found the book and its designs to be much too self-indulgent to be useful.  This is the first book I have ever returned 
 Granted, I haven't read Ethan Mordden's series of books on musical theatre...and they have been well-reviewed on this site.  I chose this book primarily because I wanted a book that examines the last 25 years of Broadway musicals and is fairly recent.  This book surveys the period from 1978 - 2003 on Broadway (and off).  Although I did agree with many of Mr. Mordden's views on various musical projects throughout the last 25 years, I have several misgivings about recommending this book.  1).  Mr. Mordden tries too hard to be witty and many of his jokes (witticisms) push too hard to be funny.  Some are downright tasteless...example: when he refers to a musical based on "Our Town" that, due to Mary Martin's fatal cancer the project was "killed".    2).  Mr. Mordden regularly insults his readers and Broadway audiences, regaling them for their "stupidity" while making numerous factual mistakes of his own in research.  He refers to only "four original songs" from the movie Footloose that transferred to the stage version.  Wrong!  A couple of times, he also assigns roles to the wrong actor in his synopsis of the shows.  3).  Mr. Mordden, in attempting to be witty and funny, is quite often just downright mean and bitchy.  4).  His pretentiousness is on full display in the use of numerous references to Broadway as "The Street".  I've never heard it called this...is this his own invention to try to coin a term and be hip and trendy?  Several times, he also get tied up in the syntax of his sentence structure and the overuse of his thesaurus in order to impress.  Thus, his meaning becomes muddled and difficult to understand.  5).  Mr. Mordden decides that, in writing this book, he has good reason to throw in right-wing political propoganda here and there.  I'm not sure why, but he does it regularly which weakens his arguments as he analyzes the shows.  He rips "Ragtime" for glorifying terrorism...not only is this analysis ridiculous, but totally out of context for a musical set in the early 20th century.  Although Mr. Mordden is quite astute and dead on in many instances...his insistence on writing in the manner and style he does makes reading the book a disappointing experience in the long run 
 I would have left this book in the airline seat back on my way to the exit.  I anticipated the follow-up to the first Frankenstein novel and wasn't disapointed by the intensity or unique spin on an old story.  But, and maybe this happens with novelists who write so many stories, I couldn't help thinking that a lot of this I had seen before. For example:  1) Plucky girl cop and wisecracking boy cop sidekick. Didn't we see this in Dragon Tears?  2) Endless knocks on contemporary American society. OK Mr. Koontz, we get it, the modern world is bad. We're sorry. We promise to try harder. We saw all of this most recently in The Face and the Odd Thomas series.  3) Angelic autistic child (or child with some other disability). The Seize the Night series, From the Corner of his Eye, and a lot of other books I can't seem to remember.  4) Tortured priest who struggles with an end times calamity and the changes that are happening to his body and psyche.  But wait, there is at least a bonus! No thinking super dogs that can save the universe if we all just hugged them more.  Koontz tends to go over the top when he talks about contemporary times. Really Mr. Koontz, we're not that bad. This moralizing detracts from the pacing and quality of his work and I wish he would stop.   The third Frankenstein book is probably going to be the last Koontz book I will read. While I like most of the characters he's created, and think many of his story lines are interesting, I am tired of being preached at and lectured to.  Reader tip: I've noticed on long driving trips that Koontz novels sound better in audio than they do when read 
 This is a terrible product:  1.  The binoculars are very heavy and awkward to use.  2.  The pictures are extremely poor.  3. The company offers poor service and packaged instructions are very brief and insufficient.  W 
 because this book is so bad that it'll take your mind away from it.   Sacre bleu! Someone reported all my previous 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be.   I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like me negatively reviewing  Silva. Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.  OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time.   I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I can say that I don't like the book, can't I? I will not be buying any more of his books. 
 I jused used this razor for the first time and was quite dissapointed.  After many attempts, I still has stubble this razor cannot seem to get.  Luckily I work in a factory so it doesn't matter.  I'll give it another shot after I get some electric shave or something like that.  For the price and the other comments, very dissapointed.  Stick with the razor 
 If you are afraid that sociopaths are learning effective ways to kill ,then this book will put your fears to rest. One of Minnery's suggestions is to find out what hotel room your target is staying in. Then rent two  hospital X-ray machines and position them in the two rooms adjacent to the  target's room. Aim them through the walls at his bed and crank them on. The  target will die of leukemia. The only practical method in his entire How To  Kill series was Hatchet To The Medulla. If these books were required  reading for every would-be killer in America the homicide rate would drop  considerably 
 I wasn't going to watch this period, but tonight on the ABC Family Channel this was on, so I'm like o.k. let's see why I wasn't up to watching this. I got my answer rather quickly. Mind you it was a clever attempt to show that it wasn't all cartoon pie in the sky. It starts with the Mystery Machine group Velma, Fred, Shaggy, Daphnie, and Scooby all going thier separate ways as a t.v. show wanting to be cancelled. It also showed that the five all had thier personal isssues with each other, and decide it's for the best to just go thier own ways. They are all brought back together by an anonymous person to solve the mystery on Spooky Island. I found Spooky Island to be a pathetc cross between Adventureland, and Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World. This is where the clever attempt starts to unravel as you see the group trying to solve the mystery, and along the way they pick up Scrappy Doo, and depending on your sense of humor this may be funny as Daphnie gets upset with Scrappy Doo because he peed on her, but to me the line Fred uses about Scrappy marking his territory on Daphnie was without a doubt a feeble attempt to rescue this movie from absolute ruin. The special effects were also out of place here for this being a cartoon for kids up to 8-9 years old to have special effects that are more geared at an older audience was improper. I think I know as to why the group Sugar Ray ended up killing thier careers as they performed in this movie, and then the group ends up turning into monsters. It would go even further to where Fred, Velma, and Daphnie all turn into monsters as well. I couldn't go further as the movie was just that bad. I found the fact that Shaggy actually fell in love with a girl as the closest thing positive that I could find about this movie, but I feel that he should date Velma though because she's more about sense, and would be the close friend that Shaggy needs that doesn't walk on all fours. You got me I watched it, and now that I have I can say without a shadow of a doubt "IT SUCKS". 
  I didn't get this order, did you credit my credit card if so email me with the conf. number and when the credit was given.   
 This book is irresponsible, and I equate selling this book to teens with selling them drugs.  Each could drive a troubled kid over the edge to suicide.  The premise of the first chapter is that for a teen to tell their troubles to a friend or anyone else is the same as "barfing on your friends".  As crisis center and peer counselors know, many teens hold their most disturbing thoughts and emotions to themselves, and in all too many that leads to suicide attempts or successful suicides.  Any useful ideas the author may have expressed in the rest of the book is more than negated by this irresponsible, lunatic advice.  Please Amazon.com, withdraw this item from sale to impressionable teenagers looking for advice in their troubled lives 
 Unlike most of the reviewers I found this book on the boring side. I think it could have been half the length, too. A lot of it was unnecessary and should have been edited better. I enjoyed The House Of Scorpion, but not this one. This book was average, nothing special and written with a lot of passive voice.  It wasn't unique. It read like many other similar books. 
 Nothing new here.  Same ideas presented in a very uninteresting fashion.  This book neither motivated me, nor did it teach me a thing about fat loss.   Jim should read some of the other books that have been published since.  The "3 Hour-Diet" by Jorge Cruise and "Five Factor Fitness" by Harley Pasternak are significantly better 
 Most of Ballard's books are large, well illustrated, and to the point. This one however spends most of the page count on his thoughts about the veterans aboard Ballard's research vessel, the battle itself, and WW2. I wouldn't mind reading about his thoughts in another book as he is usually very insightful but it wasn't what I bought this particular book for.  After Ballard's commentaries and the history sections we see only very little relating to the Yorktown and underwater archeology which is rather disappointing 
 Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb."  When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast."  But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).   It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man 
 I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration 
 Trust me. I went through many Exchange server books and I am an experienced system admin and Exchange admin. This book is the worst book for technical people. The concept in the book is for readers who are most likely a non-technical managers who want to have an overall knowledge about Exchange. If you touch Exchange server, do not read this book and waste your time. Go with Exchange 24/7 which is much better 
 im a huge fan of writer Sean Mcginly, his classics include Venomous starring Treat williams and Sonic Impact with Ice-T.  Mcginly's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world, he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film Two Days.  i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast (which included hacks like Paul Rudd) was not in the same league as superstars Traci Bingham and Ice-T who have graced some of his previous work.  Please Sean, stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff, leave that to idiots like Capra, Wenders, Scorcese etc.  They are not in your league. 
 This is an interpretive book, written and presented by Gary Gagliardi, loosely based on Sun Tzu's classic material.   Mr. Gagliardi attempts to apply the lessons of Sun Tzu's The Art of War to business practice and corporate thought, based on his understanding of the work, as well as his background in sales, marketing and management theory.   The book contains what the author asserts is the most accurate translation of Sun Tzu's work ever attempted. This description of the text is highly debateable, based on the merits of the text itself. Mr. Gagliardi achieved his translation using an internet encarta program, in which you can do a simplified character search in Chinese, and see some of the interpretive meanings of each pictogram. Based on Mr. Gagliardi's word choices, the author appears to have selectively chosen what he believes to be the correct English terms, and these results are often wrong. Since he has no formal training or background in reading / translating Chinese, this comes as no suprise.  This is certainly not a definitive work.  
 The first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other, and, as such, is unavoidably boring.  The second third of the movie features a game of charades, which is embarrassing.  The final third of the movie, though often self-indulgently mediocre, does possess some tension and drama, though it's largely derived from people's being mean to each other.  Not my idea of a good time 
  I dunno, I'm kind of skeptical about taking fatherly advice from a guy who thinks that incest is just a sign of a repressed society, and who's gone on record saying that date rape used to be just a good time. Hm, a good time for whom, one wonders?     Farrell likes to leave out certain facts. Like, for example, his complaints about how men die sooner and work more dangerous jobs. The former is proof of what, exactly?   The latter is disingenuous---men work more dangerous jobs from wihch women are excluded because these jobs tend to pay better. Then the danger is used as an excuse to keep women out of those jobs because the little ladies need protection, for which men of the Farrell type expect gratitude.  Farrell mentions at some point that almost no women died in the Viet Nam war. This is becuase women weren't allowed to FIGHT in the Viet Nam war at all.  And so forth and so on.      
 The documentary is one of the few that Fidel Castro will allow to show on the communist Cuban television. It shows the negative side of the balseros immigrants. Completely pessimist and intentional depressing and some times it make fun about Cubans. No a good example. The director picked a very poor town were everybody is black and unlettered. The other ninety percent of the rafter or Balseros, not showed on this documentary of course, are mostly white, blue collar worker, professionals, and artists. I see then all the time. Why this documentary doesn't show to the world that Cuban is the minority more represented on the highest levels of the united stated government. Balseros that came here to work hard, learn the language, make money without selling drugs. It is the type of material that makes happy those that use to ware Che Gevara tee-shirt. I am sorry about my English, I am just a Balsero that came here eight years ago and now I am American citizen, own a hause,  have my own insurance business and most at all, I am free and proud to be a cuban balsero 
 Tony Brown's book isn't backed up by any facts, just "conspiracies" he's heard. I'm convinced Mr. Brown is a Lyndon Larouche supporter who is a paraniod schizophrenic. Though some parts where interesting to read, which is why I gave it two stars, I found it hard to follow one-accusation to another. I didn't believe anything he wrote. 
 As with the reviewer above, I purchased this fan from another store and it worked well at first.  The remote was a nice touch and the fan speeds and settings worked well.  However within 4 months of owning it, when we tried to have it rotate, it turns slightly, gets stuck, and proceeds to just make a clicking sound until you stop it from rotating.  Needless to say it no longer rotates, so it is now just a stationary fan.  I even tried taking it apart to unjam it, but came to discover that the rotating gear was already worn down and that was the problem, so without new parts it could not be fixed.  Buy another fan if you want it to last, I know I am.  
 Lasted less than a year. 
 Despite the fact that Art News, december 1999, included Cindy Sherman in a list of the ten top living artists, that's irrelevant from my viewpoint. Such considerations can only be of interest to those who view art works as some sort of groceries at their disposal in the supermarket down the road. The "untitled film stills" are just a collection of "portraits" of Ms Sherman in disguise as a second rate steriotyped character removed from some movie. The introduction itself, written by Ms Sherman herself, is nothing but a bunch of trivialities and a good example of the fact that most artists are unable to talk about their own work in an articulate and intelligent way. Technically the pictures are poor and, naturally, one is led to wonder whether at the time Ms Sherman could dominate all the pratical sides of Photography. Moreover some are not even taken by her but by  people who apparently had no particular qualifications. It's hardly surprising that some of the stills look very much like the pictures one finds in family albums. Not wanting to be entirely negative, I would single out still #21 as interesting but I cannot bring myself to say more than that. The principal interest I found in this book was the confirmation that the art world is full of "masterpieces" of which the future is uncertain, to say the least. 
 What is the use of a USB port if it won't play the Ipod.  Also, the speaker wires aren't long enough 
 Amos Oz, is in my judgment, one of the greatest contemporary writers. His memoir " A Tale of Love and Darkness" is a  literary classic of tremendous power. However Oz is also a 'political prophet'. And often holds forth in a way as if to suggest he feels himself taking upon himself the mantle of his Biblical namesake. Here he should perhaps have been a bit more cautious and remembered the Jewish teaching that in our time 'prophecy' is given to 'children' and ' fools'. In this small gathering of small works Oz reiterates his well- known analysis of the Israeli- Arab conflict. It is as he understands it a 'dispute over land' between two peoples each of whom has a legitimate claim. The fanatics on one side( A fanatic in Oz's term is one for whom every means even the most bloody justifies the end) are those who say ' all is mine, and nothing is the others'. The reasonable people of which Oz is as he understands it preeminently one( though he makes it clear he too was raised as a little fanatic in pre- Jewish state 'Palestine') understand that there has to be a painful, reasonable compromise. The end of fanaticism is as he understands it the end of the Arab- Israeli conflict. A divided Holy Land, two states, one predominantly Jewish, and one Arab.  This analysis is of course not simply Oz's but has been the analysis of the moderate left in Israel, a good share of Western European Governments, and successive U.S. administrations.It now is the 'dream' of the vast majority of Israelis. It is on the basis of this analysis that US diplomatic initiatives in the Middle East has been conducted for more than half - a - century.  The problem however is that the analysis is drawn along too broad, too symmetrical and at the same time too limited lines. It is not right to say that the conflict is 'primarily' about land. Such a position was more credible three decades ago, but today given the rise of a worldwide pan-Islamic movement , it  misses the mark.  The truth is that what Oz calls 'fanatics' are the great majority on the Islamic Palestinian side. ( He denies this, but the recent 'Hamas' victory in the Palestinian elections suggests he is once again ' sweeting' Palestinian positions) . The fact is that there is no symmetry between the ' fanaticism' of the Islamic world and the alleged 'fanaticism' of the Jews even those Oz calls ' settlers'. There is no Jewish Literature no settler Literature calling for the extermination of Palestinians, as there is daily Palestinian and Arab propaganda calling for the murder and elimination of Jews.There has never been deliberate Israeli effort at murdering Palestinian civilians, while murdering of Israeli civilians is a generally accepted Palestinian tactic.  Oz misleads and presents a false picture in harping on an alleged an unreal symmetry between Israelis and Palestinians. One question of course is why he would want to do this? One answer is very simply that the kind of answer he gives makes a reasonable solution possible. Another answer is that it of course puts him above , makes him the good guy with the Europeans the Americans the Nobel Prize Committee , everyone else who would like to see the conflict resolved in this way.  Perhaps what I have just said is unfair, though Oz's tendency to preach his own views becomes increasingly irritating as they diverge with the years from the 'reality on the ground'. Had Oz' had a bit more honesty he would have given up certain familiar 'socialist egalitarian 'mantras of his  youth- and understood that there is a tremendous assymetry between the Jewish Israeli position and the Islamic Palestinian one. He would have had the honesty to understand that one very vast civilization, the Islamic, has a set of problems , which are endangering other human beings throughout the world. One such leader of that civilization , a leader who considers himself the great protector of the Palestinians, Mohammed Ahmadinejad has been continually threatening to wipe 'Israel ' from the map.  Perhaps Oz's analysis on ' fanaticism' would have been more convincing had it focused on  Mr.Ahmadinejad and his ilk.  i.e. Willy- nilly whether it likes it or not , Oz's country Israel is involved in the conflict of those who champion freedom and democracy against those Totalitarian- Terrorist- Islamic Regimes which would make the 'Koran' our sole bed-time reading.    
 Do not buy this product.  I got this product as a cheap solution to play my Ipod in my car.  I didn't want to spend $50-$80 on a Fm Transmitter, so I bought this instead.  Worked fine for a few weeks.  Ended up completely screwing up my cassette player.  It would always click and pop out.  Eventually my radio started not working as a result.  This thing ended up shorting out my radio and nothing is functionable.  Don't get this product for a cheap solution, you are much better off getting a docking FM transmitter that plugs through the cigarette lighter and charges your Ipod.  Make sure you actually spend the money on a good FM Transmitter instead of going cheap and buying one of these things 
 I don't understand the purpose of this book. The six authors all had their story told in Black Hawk Down already. These stories sound like the boring extended scene versions, whereas Bowden only used the highlights of their actions to better convey the intensity of what happened.   Only one author, Dan Schilling, rose above the cliches and bland writing of the others to write a great story. Interestingly, his chapter is the last one in the book as if the editor knew to save the best for last. His story is the only one with depth and feeling.  I respect these guys as soldiers, but as authors they have a long way to go 
 After reading this book and writing this review, I considered reporting it to the U.S Consumer Product Safety Commision, because this book is dangerously boring! I found no new information relevent to anything important. In addition, I believed that certain parts were extremely repetitive, and the topics were dull. The AP teachers may find this book interesting, however, they obviously do not care how their students will react to reading such a dry group of essays. I would highly not recommend this book to anyone, and if you do have to read it for AP World History, good luck. 
 Where's the screenplay to this? Dad goes over some pretty annoying eye candy of giants midgets and a huge fish without any real alligorical content and that about it folks, trashy staff. The big promise of some sort of father son relationship forming is again apparently absent.  Thumbs down of jessica lange, a great actress I ve see on stage a couple of times who goes completely wasted here (i don't think she mutters anything in excess of a couple of lines frankly) as a cartoon wife character.  Tim's aiming to be the next ed wood possibly with this one, but, and I never thought I d say this, ed wood at least had some workable screenplay.   Just plain trash 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 For the most part, I really do like Shakespeare's plays. But this one play I consider an utter flop. It would seem any time romance is involved, people tend to make the material more than it is. Sometimes it works, but sometimes it fails miserably. The most annoying thing about this play is that except for Iago, all of the characters are major simpletons. And while this may work in comedy (like it does in Shakespeare's "The Comedy of Errors") it does NOT work here. The sotry revolves around Othello who marries Desdemona to the disapproval of many parties, including Roderigo who wanted Desdemona for himself. Basically Iago (the so called villain) is willing to help destroy Othello supposedly to aid Roderigo. While Iago is supposedly a villain, the truth is any reasonable person in Iago's shoes would have been angered. (1) He was turned down for promotion in favor of Cassio, and everything from the play indicates that Cassio is Iago's inferior. (2) He has reason to believe that his wife has been messing around with Othello AND Cassio.) While some people have tried to write this off as another lie, this isn't too sound seeing that Iago expresses these reasons in a soliloquy where this no point whatsoever in being dishonest. One of the major annoying things about this play is that everyone keeps saying how nobel Othello is, but nothing in the play really justifies this. And as term 'noble' keeps repeating, it ends up sounding increasingly sarcastic. (Not unlike the way Antony destroys Brutus by the repeated term of 'honorable'.) Anyway, it doesn't take long for Othello to show his hypocrisy. He claims to love Desdemona, but the truth is it would seem more that he is just sexually attracted to her. (Most of you saw the "Titanic." And Rose's fiance Calvin SEEMED nice at first. But he didn't love Rose. He was only attracted to her and saw her as a piece of property. Later, he didn't have any problem with slapping her or firing gunshots in her direction. Jack LOVED Rose, and he sacrificed his life so she could live!) I think "Romeo and Juliet" is overrated, but AT LEAST Romeo LOVES Juliet, and he kills himself because he thinks she is dead. If Othello loves Desdemona, why is he so ready to jump on the issue of adultery? Iago manipulates Othello so much it is laughable. And here the devil would have such a great time confronting Othello with his own hypocrisy. (1. Iago has reason to believe that Othello has been messing around with his wife. 'Shame to him, whose cruel striking, kills for faults of his own liking!' (2) Even in "Dante's Inferno," crimes of passion and adultery are the most lightly punished ones in hell.) Iago continues to walk Othello through his degeneration until Othello becomes guilty of the unforgivable murder of someone he CLAIMED to love for something she didn't even do. Othello proves himself to be the most repulsive and unsympathetic protagonist in any of Shakespeare's writings. By the way in "Excalibur" King Arthur SAW his wife sleeping with Lance A Lot and he could NOT bring himself to kill them! In "King Lear," Albany's wife Goneril is plotting his death AND messing around with Edmund. And he remains calm and just doesn't kill his wife! In "The Scarlet Letter" Roger KNEW Hester was cheating on him, and he remained more respectable: "Even if I imagine a scheme of vengeance, what could I do better for my object than to let thee live...Live therefore and bear about thy doom with thee in the eyes of men and women in the eyes of him who thou didst call thy husband." I find it most fitting to conclude with a quote to Othello from Slayer: "Hell Awaits." 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I wasnt forced to read this book.  My chances of enjoying it werent previously tarnished by an outside force.  I am an avid reader.  I live in San Diego, so my experience with the immigration issue is just as valid as the authors(possibly more after reading this).  That being said, this book is absolutely terrible.  The idea that this author, who is so obviously clueless to the Southern California immigration issues, would actually live IN Southern California boggles my mind.  T.C. Boyle deals pompously in tired cliches and melodrama, plain and simple.  Every conflict in this book is so painfully exaggerated that in the end you have a hard time believing that these characters could actually ever exist outside of Boyle's own self-satisifed mind.  These are cardboard caricatures of real people, forced to reinforce stereotype after stereotype by a merciless author.    Problems with the source material aside, I have a hard time believing that Boyle actually has a shred of talent.  All of his analogies are heavy handed and amateur at best, he suffers from serious point of view issues that should have been resolved after a first draft, his dialogue is painfully wooden and pathetic, and his characters don't even have the slightest amount of personality or realism.    But anyway, The Tortilla Curtain follows the lives of two couples, American "liberals"(apparently to Boyle being a liberal means you recycle and don't want your children to eat junk food) Delaney and Kyra, and Hispanic illegals Candido and America(oooh see what he did there?  He named the female AMERICA! IT'S SYMBOLISM! OH MY HOW AMAZINGLY ORIGINAL IS THAT?).  In the beginning of the story, Denaley accidentaly hits Candido with his car, and the rest of the story is split up in an unimaginative chapter to chapter narrative switcher-oo to detail the different lives led by the different couples.  So there you have it.  You have Candido and America constantly being put down by "the man", and Kyra and Denaley in a constant state of war with "the man" whole Denaley struggles with his budding senses of prejudice against the illegals(because according to Boyle, every Mexican you come across has a knife and is ready to jump you or steal your car).    Eveyerthing about this novel is so self aware and pompous.  After Denaley hits Candido with his car, upon asking if he is alright and Candido responds in some wicked foreign tongue, we're treated to this simply laughable exerpt: "It wasn't French he was speaking, that was for sure.  And it wasn't Norwegian.  The US didn't share a two-thousand mile border with france--or with Norway either.  The man was Mexican, Hispanic, that's what he was, and he was speaking Spanish."  After reading this, i simply had to put the book down and step away for a while.  The fact that a man living in Los Angeles could mistake a Hispanic man for a French or Norwegian man, or mistake Spanish for French of Norwegian, EVEN FOR A SPLIT SECOND, is just too much for me to handle.  And Boyle feeling the needed to italicise every Spanish word throughout the book(even ones like "burrito") just adds a whole new level of white-boy filth to this already dirty piece of trash.  This kind of ridiculous bile is what you'll be treated to for 355 painful pages if you chose to put yourself through this excercise in stereotypical slop.  I hope you'll stay away from this Tortilla 
 "Classic" sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking, (and now "spinning"?)  I hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans, leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor. Dangerous for working out, and certainly not "classic!"  
 Not since the writing of Karl Marx has there been such garbage 
 This is an awful book.  It purports to be some kind of sociological analysis of the cultural forces shaping the Sopranos.  It is, instead, a slanted political diatribe, essentially blaming all our ills on a loss of collective social sensibility and retreat from political liberalism.  That's rank B.S.  I consider myself a liberal (believe it or not) but do not blame the forces of social disintegration solely on a recent shift in our political winds.  I don't know that I even agree with one of the author's key assumptions:  that we care less about one another now.  Some communities and neighborhoods are more tightly knit together than ever before.  We move steadily toward a more orderly, efficient and respectful society, despite our mistaken retreat from social liberalism 
 I eagerly awaited my copy of this guide book only to be very disappointed  with the actual book. The author does not go into any great depth about any  of the rides, attractions, or shows. The maps, what few of them there were,  are small and cramped.  The restaurant and food places did not contain  menus as I expected, but, rather, short blurbs on the general kinds of food  served. A better choice for the reader would be Kelly Monaghan's  "Universal Studios Escape. The Ultimate Guide to the Ultimate Theme  Park Adventure," or the sections on Universal Studios in Rita Aero's  "Disny World. The Essential Guide to Amazing Vacations.&quot 
 Please stop calling Espers a folk band. This album hurts my head. Not shimmering, not psychedelic, nor any other gushing praise. Its bad rock music guising as folk. Just tune a guitar into DADGAD and play something better yourself 
 After a brief email correspondence with Bryant, it's easy to see why this was such a boring, poorly written book. I'm glad I was given the book and didn't actually waste any money on it. The book jumps from one newspaper article to another, and never really tells me, an avid baseball fan anything I didn't already suspect about players taking steroids and other performance enhancers. I mean really, it's been going on for ages in all sports. Bryant's obsessive fascination with race and racism really comes through when he spends an entire chapter on Barry and Bobby Bonds and race relations between writers and players. His never really backs up any of his racial assertions with any more then anecdotes and opinions. He blames Bobby's alcoholism on the way he was treated by the baseball world and blames Barry's problems on everyone but Barry. He claims that white writers make life troublesome for difficult black players but treat difficult white players with kit gloves. Tell that one to Steve Carlton, Howard. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste even five bucks on a used copy of this. Your time would be wasted to even get a copy from the library. Mine went in my recycle bin 
 A really quite awful book from a once-quite good author (witness 'Oranges  are not the Only Fruit', an inspiring and insightful novel later turned  into an equally good television programme). Layers of pretentious prose  tumble over each other whilst blindingly fatuous 'points' are made with all  the subtlety of, well, any of Jeanette Winterson's other, later works. As  Emerson, Lake and Palmer once found out, basing a work around an epic  subject does not make the work epic. It merely throws the paucity of ideas  into relief 
 I bought this gun thinking it looked like a cool and fun gun. I go through 1 freakin war with it and the thing wont cock any more and pieces are falling off it. I know how to treat guns but this is ridiculous, and for the record im not a kid im just to lazy to sign up 
 DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. this book promotes eating disorders, plain and simple. i'm a dancer, and i have always been thin, but the "suggestions" this book gives are absurd. dancers are very conscious of their bodies, compare themselves to other dancers and hold themselves up to high standards. this book pretty much says that a dancer who is 5'3" should be 94 pounds. this is so messed up. the book suggests a diet of 1200 calories a day. look at the titles: "why a dancer should diet: you can't hide anything in tights" and "the chain around the refrigerator." it shows a dancer ready to "feast" on garden products. besides that, this book was written in 1984. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 this was a stupid book hence the name stupid book a boy named cloyd is staying with walter and a new friendship formed it was dumb if you have to do a report that is due in 3 days and you have to choose between a 7,998,654,123 page book on taxes and the 90 page book called bearstone for goodness sake choose the tax book. All the book talks about is an indian sitting there on his butt making kissing faces. 
 as a student i was addicted to Jackie Collins while i normally cant stand trash. why are her books different? her characters are so bitchy is one reason. although set in hollywood she is always writing about jewish north london just as simenon's paris is really liege. gina germaine psychopath and nymphomaniac will always represent my ultimate heartthrob. i wondered whether she reappears in the recent sequel 
 This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep 
 This book is more like a theoretical exploration of what promotes addictive behavior, and will be of no real help to you if you are trying to help (or are yourself) an addict. There is no exploration into what treatments will work or not work, and some of what he says doesn't really seem to make sense in a real-life situation. Overall, it's useless unless you are curious about what might (theoretically) cause addictive behavior 
 I returned this book to Amazon, because there were no color pictures of any of the myriad hot peppers discussed therein.  There is no real way to identify a particular type of pepper with only a black and white drawing/photo.  As someone who taught school from elementary to university level, I can say that learners, especially me, would greatly benefit by viewing color photos of the various hot peppers discussed in this publication 
 This poorly-written superficial book reveals more about the art of disinformation than it does about 9/11/01.  It trots out all the standard hoaxes -- like pod-planes and no-jetliner theories.  But it has some good parts thanks to its plagiarising 911Research.  For example, Revealed's description of NIST's investigation is copied almost verbatim from 911Research, which it doesn't credit anywhere. Compare these excerpts from the book to excerpts from 911Research's NIST page in late 2004, which you can verify using the web archive:  [9/11Revealed] FEMA eventually allocated a mere $600,000  to fund the only investigation of the building collapses that functioned before the site had been mopped up.  [911Research] This contrasts with the $600,000 allocated by FEMA  to fund the only investigation of the building collapses that functioned before the site had been mopped up.   [9/11Revealed] Although it was funded with a budget of $30 million it worked on the premise of the official story, namely, that the collapses of the Twin Towers and WTC 7 resulted from the impacts of scheduled airliners.  [911Research] NIST's investigation ... was funded with a budget of $30 million. ... its investigation is being conducted strictly within the confines of the official story -- that the collapses of the Twin Towers and Building 7 resulted from the jetliner impacts.   [9/11Revealed] In its 7 May 2003 news release on the progress of its investigation, it seemed clear  that the agency had been hampered in its investigation by a lack of access to evidence.  [911Research] In its May 7, 2003 News Release on the progress of its investigation, there is clear evidence  that the agency has been hampered in its investigation by a lack of access to evidence.   Of course Revealed avoids what 911Research is most known for: its overwhealming case for the controlled demolition of the Towers 
 The 1983 thatrical release tells the true but much abridged story of Billy Mills, the Oglala Sioux who came from obscurity to win the 10,000 meter race in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The core of the movie focuses on Mills's stint as a student and runner at the University of Kansas,facing the overt racism of his teammates and the white community, and his personal conflict with his coach, played by Pat Hingle, over Mills's racing style. The racing scenes are some of the best on film (if you overlook the out of place football field at the Olympics), and "Running Brave" rises above the level of the other sports hero genre and other racing films.    I have given this DVD a 1-star rating because it is NOT the theatrical release, but the version that was re-edited for broadcast TV. (The movie was released as PG. This version, as noted on the DVD box, is rated G.) Several key scenes have been deleted, watering-down or eliminating much of the conflict. This DVD uses a 4:3 (TV) aspect ration, not the theatrical widescreen presentation. Quality of the video transfer is very poor.  
 The other two reviewers got it mostly right.  But let me make it clear: this lightly moistened wipes can indeed remove fingerprints and dust -- and even prevent dust build-up for a few days.  The problem is, when the cleaning liquid dries, it leaves ugly fog-like marks on your LCD screen.  I've found out that after it dries, using a lint-free soft cloth to lightly polish the screen helps clean up the screen completely.  But then, I could have just used the cloth to remove cust and fingerprints.  I think these wipes can be helpful when you have serious fingerprints or dirt (not just dust) on your LCD screen.  Otherwise, for most people, this is just a waste of money and can actually make you frustrated 
 this book is interesting, don't get me wrong... but the author really went overboard with the length... it's too long... it's divided into two parts: power and pleasure. Power is interesting, but i was looking forward to the second part. I thought it would concentrate on the social aspects that make Bombay the city that it is... religion, food, tradition, etc. All I got was 200 more pages that centered on several characters who are not special at all...It ended up bothering me, how he dedicates such a long part of the book to this dancer that he calls "Monalisa", when there is nothing extraordinary or remotely interesting about her... complete waste of time...I don't understand his infatuation with her.  The endless stories about his experiences in Bollywood are boring as well. Very disappointed...  It would have been a good book had it been only 200 pages long.  Sorry Suketu! 
 well if your smart then you will wipe your bummie with the hole roal!!! but you cant flusch that and it makes wayste and you have to thro it in the bathtub and it wheel EXPLOHDE!!!!!!!!! i wiped with it and i couldnt flusch it and i tryed and my hause explohded!!!!!!!!!! the inchuranse companee was angrie at meee.DONT Buy it if you need safe paper.buy cotonele. 
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing else The explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculous The art work of the robots was good Will Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon. I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters.  The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity.  None of this appeared in the movie 
 I agree with Susan Taylor's review.  I have read other books by this author and was excited that he wrote a book for young men about growing up... luckily I read it before giving it to my son because I threw it in the trash when I was finished.  I thought it was an excellent book until I got to the sexual experimentation... Although I still think that Michael's books are great resources, he lost a bit of credibility in my opinion.   
 One would think that a publisher/author would invest in an editor to review the work before releasing it to the public.  This book is a pig's breakfast.  Consider:  p. 48.  Step 10:  Go to the Styles Palette and click on the water drop style icon [the one you made in a previous example] . . ..  What icon?  What previous example?  What is an example?  I thumbed through the pages and could not find one 'example.'  Boys and girls, it goes on and on.  Use your money to go see a movie and use what's left over for a trip to Hong Kong.  This book was a lot of money for rubbish.  Positive point?  The paper seems to be of good quality 
 I finally gave up reading this joke around page 200. Doss is an amateur writer who breaks all the conventions of good writing, not for effect but out of incompetence. He is melodramatic and has dialogue that is absolutely unnatural and unconvincing. Doss has accomplished one thing with his writing--he has made it possible to feel pain while reading. Who else can describe two men eating animal crackers as: "...when the animal cookies had been decimated by the pair of voracious carnivores"? Please 
 The book made a huge impression on me 35 years ago. I fell in love with the story and was envious of Sam's year in the wilderness.  Last night, I found the movie for sale at a local book/music/DVD store. I vaguely remembered that My Side of the Mountain had also been a movie way back when, but I had forgotten all about it. I bought the movie and my wife and I watched it.  Ugh. This movie was a waste of time. It was poorly written, abysmally acted, and strayed so far from the book that it was virtually unrecognizable to anyone who read and loved the book.  My wife and I got the impression that the movie was adapted by someone who doesn't like hunting or killing of animals. Reference after reference was made in the movie to guns and hunters being bad, killing animals being bad and even Frightful was killed by a hunter apparently out shooting for sport. So Sam never got his deerskin outfit (as he did in the book). Instead, he bought leather gloves and wore some kind of yellow rain slicker during the winter.  At one point near the end, when Bando returned to visit, there were so many people in Sam's hollowed out tree that I could have sworn it was a magic tree, much like the magic tents in the latest Harry Potter movie. Small from the outside. But huge on the inside.  What an awful movie. Even the cinematography was horrid. If I had to watch Frightful fly around for minutes on end one more time I might have shot her myself.  Avoid this movie at all costs!  But please, do, read the book. It's one of the best children's' novels ever published 
 In all this hype and whining over Williams, we forget that he was executed for a reason!  Why do we remember the life of this brutal killer who founded a gang that is still killing people to this day, yet probably noone reading this can name the innocent people he killed.  The fact that Tookie Williams simultaneous inconsistent claims of innocene and redemption were even considered is a sad commentary on American culture.  My sympathies lie with the people who deserve it; his victims.  Their names were Albert Owens, Yen Il Yang, Tsai Shai, and Ye Chin Lin.  Remember that out of everyone in this mess, Tookie was the only one with a choice.  As for those dumb dummies who think he's innocent, he had 24 years of appeals after he was convicted by a Jury of his peers( there was a black man on that jury and a Latino man so no crying racism).  Hopefully his execution proved that we value human life in this country so much that the only appropriate punishment for the most brutal murderers is that they pay with their lives.  
 I love these whacky kind of comedys, and when I heard about this one I tried to track it down for about 2 years. Finally after it's release here for under $5 aus. I was highly disapointed by waiting in anticipation for what I was sure was going to be histerical 'cause of what other reviewers wrote about it..  It was a complete bore for about 30 minutes. I didnt think what they where doing was funny at all. The only funny bits where a couple of the sketches Chevy Chase was in and an amusing puppet. But the 4 or 5 laughs I had during this movie didnt save it.  I'd recomend you watch Kentucky Fried Movie instead of this snore fest. Even it's attempt a stoner humour failed. Beleive me, i love these kind of movies, but this is by far one of the biggest piles of $#!% I have ever seen that so many have said is a classic. It doesnt compete with goof satire movies like... - Kentucky Fried Movie  - Airplane / Flying High 1 & 2  - Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3  - Repossessed  - Silence Of The Hams  - Spaceballs  - HotShots 1 & 2  - Loaded Weopen - Scary Movie  - History Of The World - Young Frankinstein - Anything by Monty Python  check out one of those instead 
 Shoulda just said NO. Sentimental pap blown up to ludicrously Tragic proportions with a musty Big Theme wheezed out in a 19th Century Romantic style that doesn't convince for a second for all the calculated  emotionalism. Trite and unreal. Nice attempt to create a real film from  this project, but the score just amplifies the problems. Tries to be  everything it is not. The simplified Mahleriana approach may appeal to some  listeners and public radio programmers 
 Both of these items were shipped to the wtrong address.  I called and received no support.  Dissapointed with Amazon.  ( they went to my son in Iraq who as a Navy pilot does not have any interest in the Nanny Diaries! 
 Do not buy this book.. The information was very repetetive and worthless. The main advice in this book was to get a group of manufacturing, marketing, and patenting "experts" that would guide you through the whole process of product development ..!! The whole book keeps referring to these "experts" numerous times in almost all the chapters. I also didn't like the side quotes found on each page. They were distracting and offered no real useful information 
 We actually paid money to see this movie in a theater. We sat through the entire thing waiting for it to have some socially redeeming value. We left not only disappointed, but angry. Outraged.   Yes, I know what it was about. Of course, I didn't know that going in, that would have been nice. And I couldn't believe the arrogance and the audacity of celebrating a culture of elitism that thrives upon decadence and depravity. Why are we watching this? And WHY ARE WE PAYING FOR IT?  It is even more obvious, a handful of years later, that Tom Cruise is "not OK." That Nicole Kidman has her own brand of dark drama going on, a drama that is not that far removed from Britney Spears and Anna Nicole Smith. It's larger than life and darker than insanity. We should do something about it. I wish I knew what. But I don't want it with my popcorn 
 VERY DISSAPPOINTING,HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE KICKBOXING SAGA,A PRODUCTION THE COULD OF DONE WITHOUT,DAVID SLOAN DIES.........LOL.COMMON REALLY EVEN I COULDNT BELIEVE IT,SEE THE MOVIE FOR A GOOD LAUGH,NOTHING ELSE 
 The book does give great interviews and words of Vonnegut, but there is no substantial whole.  It is poorly laid out, and makes no concrete assertions or comments on Vonnegut's words 
 Hi,  This book is a good pictorial representation of some of the concepts of some of the Chinese Martial arts.  Not necessarily Kung Fu - Least Shaolin Kung Fu.  It is refreshing and entertaining to read the material with accompanying pictures as a fictional novel.  But as far as the knowledge on Kung Fu or Martial Arts is concerned it has very very little to offer in that area.  The book is written in good and simple English.  However it lacks the scientific approach, the thoroughness and completeness required for any Martial Arts or Kung Fu reference book.  In fact the book does not have even 1 % knowlege on the traditional Shaolin Kung Fu !  The book tries to demonstrate a lot of techniques as Kung Fu techniques but their overall applicability from this book is only fictional (not real).  For a serious martial arts student or a Shaolin Kung Fu seeker the book is of a very little value 
 I'm not sure what I expected, but I vaguely remember James Frey, author of "A Million Little Pieces" saying this was one of his top five reads; I couldn't believe it!  I must confess that my mother and I (she's a young 83, I'm 48) have created our own little "Book Club" that is bi-coastal - it gives us one more thing to talk about when we chat on the phone.  At least she finished it; disappointed!  Every time I picked it up it seemed to wander aimlesslesly from one subject to the other, without much regard to the pace.  I felt I was constantly on siesta!  From now on we're sticking to the classics - this felt utterly pointless 
 I read "The Scar" as my first taste of Mieville's work, and was blown away.  I have to say that this work is not up to the level of his later work, but still evokes interest and images.    While dark, it did not grab me by the throat the way his other work did.  And I felt very little association or empathy for the characters.  This is a good book, but worth reading more as a glimpse of where the author started from than as a work itself 
 Pardon me if I also wish to review anonymously. I now can come forward with my negative experience with the Seiko Black Monster too after seeing a handful of other ex-owners post theirs. I had my Seiko Black Monster SKX779K1 for about three weeks when it also did a freeze of all its movements and sounds. No sweep motion, no tick-tock of any sort. But unlike someone else's experience, mine never sprang to life anymore. AFter I shook it gently sideways to wind it up, its second hand moved for only about 10-12 seconds then stopped again. I did this "Watch CPR" several times but still always failed to resucitate it. My watch also was forming a light miss on the inside of its crystal a day after I used in while doing the dishes of all things. This is a divers watch? I already packed it up last Thursday for return and dropped it off at my local USPS, and Im still thinking whether to give it a chance and get another Black Monster or to get an entirely different model or brand. I must day that I am DISAPPOINTED BIG TIME in this watch! I loved the way it looked and it really made me felt bad to return it. But to me a watch is an instrument first, an accessory only second. 
 Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'  I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.   The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot 
 The plot for this movie is actually quite good, a microbiochemical weapon accidently created and released on the world is captured and is being brought back from Russia, but the Russians are trying to recapture it and release it on the major cities of the world and it is up to our "hero" to stop them before it happens. What ruins this great movie is the very bad acting. When asked if he knew about Agent Red, Dolph's character said it best, "Sounds like a bad action movie," and it is. From LT. Christian being seriously out of uniform to the underlying "love story", this movie just reeks. The only good thing I saw in this movie was Randolph Mantooth. His small part made up for the movie in my opinion. So unless you're a big Mantooth fan, this movie is a waste of money 
 I ordered this book online, and just received it.  A quick scan through and my first impression was...pictures?  Where are they?  It's a cookbook about cupcakes.  I'm probably going to decide which ones I want to make based on how good they look.  That may sound simplistic, but when's the last time a recipe grabbed you without a picture to go from?  Especially when you *paid* for the book.  I already had "Hey There, Cupcake! 35 Yummy Fun Cupcake Recipes for All Occasions" but there was no recipe in there to make the kind of frosting that piles up sky-high, which is why I bought this book (I have recently developed a love for cupcakes).  I don't see any kind of frosting recipe like that in here.  Literally, I don't *see* a recipe for that frosting.  I doubt I'll use this book at all 
 This charger does not seem to charge the batteries fully. I thought that my rechargable batteries were "out of life", but discovered that it was just a case of this charger failing to recharge them fully. My Daughter brought home a cheap Sakar overnight charger when visiting. I popped in a set of batteries I thought were done for, and found them to be just fine using her Sakar charger. What happens on my charger is that the lights (indicating that the batteries have been fully charged) all go off, and the batteries are "cool to the touch" (indicating that they have been fully recharged). Nope! Only about half way recharged 
 This is a well written easy to understand book.  But if you're interested in designing loudspeakers, this book is lacking.    This book is clearly and concisely written with good supporting graphics.  Mr. Murphy does a great job of qualitatively explaining speaker design but leaves out two of the most important quantitative design topics:  1.  How to design an enclosure.  2.  How to size inductors and capacitors in cross over networks.  It seams like these topics could have been covered more deeply, and other more advanced topics deferred.  For example, Mr. Murphy commits several pages to warning about summing errors with electronic crossovers (which is a real concern), but there are no pages committed to how to design a Butterworth or Linkwitz-Riley filter he discusses in the book.  I rate this book low because I was expecting more design detail. This book may be of value to you if you're thinking about speaker and just what to know what's involved.  Also, if you're shopping for loudspeakers, this book will certainly make you a savvier consumer. 
 I was expecting a fun CD that I could pop in when I'm getting ready for a girls night out, but was extremely disappointed.  There was only one song that made it worth buying and that is the cover of Fly.  
 This book is shallow and terrible. I would not recommend it. It covers a wide area but does not go into sufficient details. Mile wide inch deep 
 This is surely one of the nastiest little films ever made.  It is a waste of a handsome young actor, John Shepherd, who plays a very troubled and closeted construction worker, David.  He is secretly in love with his best friend, Theo, and his covert problems multiply when Theo moves in with a girlfriend.  David can't handle the competition for Theo's affection, and goes overboard in trying to undermine their relationship.  He decides to come out to his parents, and tell Theo of his love, on a national TV-show!  This unfortunate plan, needless to say, backfires.  David's ghastly father pronounces him sick and summarily kicks him out of the house.  His now ex-friend Theo is angry at being manipulated, and shows David just how much so by beating him with a lead pipe!  It turns out that he and his girlfriend were a perfect match afterall:  they are equally unpleasant.  They walk off into the sunset together, but not before they look back at poor, bleeding David with a mixture of pity and loathing.  The perfect ending for a mean-spirited film that TLA should be ashamed to have produced 
 My main dispute with this Cinderella romance between young sisters and the conveniently available rich bachelor's from far away America -- it's rated R.  Why did the director feel it necessary to tell what is essentially a chocolate-chomping girl's heartbreak with nudity and graphic groping?  Teens love their romance, boy-girl breakups, and crush's.  This media world of overt-sexuality and easy porn - come on --- let the kids have their childhood.   Oh, how many young sis' have coveted their older sister's boyfriends.  All of them! And that sexual awakening thing is happening at breakneck speed, but in 60 percent of American girls - the actual event begins with marriage. In this film marriage is not portrayed as something folks do for love: the sisters want to marry up at any cost.  Is that a good lesson for teen gals?   Perhaps I'm not being fair on the philosophical side, but how about a believable story we can care about?  You won't find it in I Capture the Castle.  You'll instead discover your first yawn developing about ten minutes into the production as the eccentric wife does her nude scene, the eccentric writer does his prison scene, the girls do their not enough to eat in this romantic castle scene, and suddenly the guys show up like Price Charmings out of nowhere like we haven't seen that one before.  I'm sorry.  I think I'll take a nap. 
 This book is very confusing to read. When and where in history did something like this take place? Who is she talking about? I know it is a book of fiction, but is there any historical fact in it? One of the reviews  inside the book says "The beauty and complexity that existed 6000  years ago", and "Mackey joins the company of Jean Auel and  Elizabeth Marshall Thomas"!!! Unlike Mrs. Mackey, Auel and Thomas  research their books and set them in a real time in history. That is what  good Historical Fiction is all about 
 A flattering cover photo on a pricey double-disc set that includes nothing over previous "Best Of" releases from Kenny Loggins. How many times MUST he re-package "the hits"? And one can't help but wonder: why are tracks like Vahevala and Angry Eyes, taken from the first and second Loggins and Messina records, played off here as strictly Loggins' material? Just because he was the principle writer on those tracks? Jim Messina wrote and produced some of the best moments that duo ever recorded, yet the only face on this compilation is that of Loggins. Smacks of smug profiteering. I'd much rather listen to a re-mastered retrospective of L&M than ever again hear a note of Don't Fight It.  
 I bought this DVD not having listened to Amon Amarth, but from the reviews I read and from checking it out it seemed like just what I was looking for and a good amount of content for the price.  Just watched the first disc and boy was I disappointed! I don't know what kind of music this is, but it is NOT death metal and it is not brutal in any way shape or form. All of the songs sound pretty much the same, and the music is this happy sounding tripe which is totally predictable, banal shifting between two chords or at most four. Nothing evil, unique or interesting sounding. Whenever the guitarists sound like they are doing something a bit more, it's always the same kind of patterns using open strings. The guitarists really just aren't good musicians, or songwriters.  The singer is what makes it sound heavy to people, but that gets old after a while with lousy boring music. The drummer is pretty tight, but he can't get past the guitarists' lack of talent.  Sorry I really tried to like this, but I think the reviews here need a dose of realism 
 quindlen's advice here is certainly pretty sensible stuff, though i think any reasonably intelligent person could have come up with something just as good.  my real beef is with the price of the book in comparison to what you get.  the book is only 64 pages long and half of those pages are pictures with no text anywhere on the page.  so, being charged $12.95 for a 32 page book, and a pretty small one at that, strikes me as beyond ludicrous, even if the content is pretty good.  i'm just glad i checked it out from the library instead of buying it 
 There comes a point in every conversation about terrorism with liberals when they announce, with the all of the smug assurance of the possessor of a great and secret knowledge, "America is the greatest terrorist state in history". I've never quite believed in this theory and have always felt that it was so obviously untrue that it didn't require refutation. As real terrorism increases and this mantra is no longer being chanted solely by the dim but earnest but has even penetrated to the sub-plankton of the intellectual food-chain, I feel that the lie that will not die deserves its day in court.   Perhaps the foremost proponent of the theory of America as a terrorist state is William Blum, author of "Rogue State" a book recommended by no less a personage than that great modern master of terror, Osama bin-Laden. I'm using mainly this work as evidence for the prosecution. As evidence for the defence I will be calling on history, logic and common sense.  I'm not claiming that Blum's book is factually incorrect; in fact Blum is an impressive collector of facts and statistics, it's just that Blum never seems to have learned the meaning of a little thing called "context". As the poet Blake said, "A truth that's told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent". In this instance Blum's ignorance of context involves amnesia about a violent internationalist ideology that still blights the lives of millions of Cubans, Chinese and Koreans. If you are thinking "Communism" give yourself a nice big gold five-pointed star. In almost every one of the conflicts described by Blum America was intervening to prevent the spread of Communism. In this respect America has been the victim of its own success. America did prevent the spread of Communism and because of this we never get to see how most of these countries would have turned out under the governance of the various ragbag of revolutionary movements that were suppressed. Fortunately, or unfortunately as the case may be, we have both living examples and historical evidence to take into consideration and I'm guessing that in most cases we can lean towards Pol Pot rather than Fidel Castro. Behind every one of Blum's carefully quantified death tolls falls a shadow; the shadow of a vastly greater narrowly averted Communist death toll   Doing a quick calculation based on "Rogue State" I can find no more than five million victims of "American terrorism". The soviets managed to kill ten million people in the Ukraine alone. That's twice as many victims in one single communist atrocity than occurred throughout the entire period of post-WWII American hegemony. Mao Tse Tung killed sixty million people without even going to war. For a more up to date example, let's consider the Marxist president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe. Since his ascent to power Mugabe has presided over an economic collapse spectacular even by African standards. This has mainly been caused by his racist assault on his nation's White minority and attempted genocide of his rival tribe. The Communist miracle has transformed Zimbabwe from a peaceful and prosperous nation into a country of rape camps and drains blocked by murdered infants and aborted foetuses. Still, he really stuck it to Whitey, so I suppose in Blum's eyes that makes the misery of millions of Black Zimbabweans acceptable.   Did I mention Fidel Castro? Blum claims that America's hostility to Cuba was based on the fact that, "Cuba had carried out The Unforgivable Revolution, a very serious threat of setting a "good example in Latin America". So it had nothing to do with Cuba's collaboration with a hostile enemy power and its willingness to be used as an offshore nuclear missile base then?  According to Blum, "The saddest part of this is that the world will never know what kind of society Cuba could have produced if left alone, if not constantly under the gun and the threat of invasion, if allowed to relax its control at home. The idealism, the vision, the talent were all there. But we'll never know". Yes indeed! We'll never know. I'd suggest that Blum uses some of the royalties from his book to take a vacation in North Korea. A short period of starvation might stimulate his imagination. Blum might even want to consider how Cuba might have turned out if its threadbare economy hadn't been propped up by Russia and China for half a century.  Post WWII America was confronted by a superpower whose sworn objective was America's destruction. To achieve this end the Communists fomented and funded revolutionary coups throughout the world. To suppress Communism the US sometimes supported people who did very bad things. Blum doesn't care to expound upon the equally bad thing done by their opponents. Call me old fashioned but I call that bias. Blum is also wrong in his allegation that the US is solely responsible for the atrocities committed in places like Nicaragua. Yes, America did train Para-military forces but, unless Blum can show me the manuals, I refuse to believe that it trained them to rape and torture civilians. Skinning civilian faces was something that the natives invented all by themselves. It seems that because the Communists ultimately failed they are also absolved, in Blum's mind, of all guilt. If the Communists had succeeded in their forced conversion of Africa and Latin America it is possible, perhaps even probable, that the end of the last century may have witnessed the collapse of Capitalism and not of Communism. Some persistent left-liberals will argue that this would have been a good thing. None of these liberals choose to live in one of the worlds remaining Communist states. Now isn't that funny? 
 Este libro es un conjunto del Cristianismo, Catolicismo y el Espiritismo.  El Capítulo 12 habla sobre las maneras de contactar "guias espirituales" por medio de las tablas de escritura espiritista, las Ouijas, Mesas que ladean, etc.   No debemos dejarnos engañar.  Por este medio se invitan espíritus de Satanas, no espíritus celestiales.  Se trata de engañar al lector haciendo le ver que se hace un contacto celestial por estos medios, cuando en realidad por este medio se invitan espíritus de Satanas, demonios y angeles de las tinieblas. Satanas conoce muy bien las escrituras y las usa para confundir al pueblo de Dios.  Tenemos que tener mucho cuidado a el contenido de los llamados "libros espiruales" 
 Ok, i REALLY thought this ball would be GREAT considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the NBA.  NOT SO!  This ball feels very similar to the cheap $20 balls you can get at your local department stores!    Feels similar to the Wilson NCAA solution game ball, but slightly less tacky, but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber.  I personally do not like that.  This ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box, without a break in period.  Well, i hope it gets to feeling better over time, but since it supposedly has not break in period, i am very skeptical.  I honestly do not feel the "crosstraxxion" design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball.  If you like the feel of leather, this is NOT for you.  I am NOT impressed!  Search for reviews for this ball before purchasing!  The only thing you can do with this ball that you can't do with others, is say "Well at least this is the Official Game Ball the pros use!"  
 This was a somewhat enjoyable book until about 2/3 of the way through it. It became an excrutiatingly slow read. However, if you want to read up on HIV and it's symptoms/emotions, you might enjoy it 
 Hardly any detail in the examples and missing too many important and common techniques 
 The book should be renamed to "How to Clean".  The current title sounds like it would give tips on making housework quicker and easier--boy that was way off!  The book gives basic details on cleaning a house as any person might already be aware of and there were no shortcuts mentioned.  If  you're looking for timesaving techniques, it's not here 
 The book gave insight to the more conservative Amish lifestyles but her explanations for their hard life leaves one to wonder if her husband isn't just a free loader.  She is definitely the worker in that family 
 I could see more artificiality from staring at the surface of a stucco wall.  This book presents planetary images taken by the NASA probes over the years.  Some speculate that there are some extraterrestrial intelligent activities present, not.  I see anomalies of light and shadow and just plain old geological activities 
 The book reads like a series of very shallow popular magazine articles. I felt like I was wasting my time, and just skimmed most of it after the first few chapeters 
 For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable.   One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with.   Just FYI.   
 as always, the dutchman comes through with quality mixxing talent. unfortunately for me, i felt there was a lack for outstanding musical selection.  i didnt feel like there were any outstanding tracks... nothing with a unique and outstanding rhythm. i like progressive mixes, but i have to say this mix didn't progress to anything outstanding.   
 This book arrived expediently but was extemely bent and the cover was severely torn; it had been crammed into an envelope that was way too small.  It was listed as being in very good condition 
 This system is way too complex and takes far too much work for me.  To set up and learn to use this system would take hours for me.    And I am a visual person; out of sight out of mind.  I was looking for helpful suggestions and really didn't find anything that was beneficial.  I am disappointed in this book 
 If you are looking for special cake recipes for special occasions, I would not recommend this book.  All of the recipes in one way or another rely on a variety of mixes. I was very disappointed! There are other cake books  which are much more worthy 
 I'm confused.  Must not be in sync with most readers.  And Lee Child (he gave it a glowing review), and I've read every one of his books and loved them.  I found myself wondering why there was so much repetition of the "facts" and skimmed through to the end to see if it justified the means.  Didn't get it.    I guess there was a kind of closure, but it was the kind where the narrative was so certain, you thought it had to be a red herring but then it turned out not to be.  Perhaps I haven't read enough true crime -- just "Belly of the Beast," and "In Cold Blood," come to mind -- to develop the sensibility to appreciate writing like this?  I don't know, you tell me 
 I'm usually a sucker for just about any kooky theories backed up by barely-there evidence. Even trying very hard to be generous (hey, I'm a Christian and I think it would be fabulous if the stuff in this book were true), I think I could poke a hole in every page. And that's after perhaps 12 months of formal Mandarin study and a similar amount of Cantonese.  Don't buy it. It's embarrassing to Christians that this sort of thing gets passed around as scholarship. If they'd wrapped it up with a plot around it, it'd make a great work of fiction 
 George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.  Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.'   But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.  
 all her other books are interesting, but not this one. lowdnes.com is a sales pitch site. no valuable info there other than ordering new copies of her books. 
 I found this book wholly disappointing. It was an extremely narrow and one sided view of not only the Lubavitch community but also Judaism itself. Like the author, I too am Jewish, however, I found the references to common day Jewish practices (such as donning tefillin) offensive, as this was seen as alien whereas in Judaism this is commonplace. Anyone who has had any contact with the Lubavitch community will find them nothing short of extremely hospitable, charitable and welcoming. With regard to their suspicion of the secular world: I think this book is proof, if it were required, that this type of suspicion is justifiable. In defence of the Postville community specifically, I'm amazed that there is little mention of the employment capabilities which the factories bring and the significant number of non-Jews employed by the family. I'm saddened that a Jew insecure as he must be with his own faith, feels it necessary to write a book like this. The book is at best badly written anti-Semitism and at worst a very dangerous attack on a religion to which Mr Bloom claims to belong, as is shown by some of the sadly anti-Semitic comments posted here. At this time in our history, Jews should be rallying to support each other instead of factionalising openly 
 Too many pages on equipment that is way out of date:  Coax cable w/ BNC connectors? ISA Slots? Tuning a Windows 95/98 or Millenium Edition Server?   Plus the writing is extremely corny.. 
 This is another wooden, easily solved Krentz book.  What has happened to the author who wrote such classics as Absolutely, Positively or Trust Me?  These last few years have been nothing but one formulaic, clunky novel after another, with tiresome characters and easily-predicted plotlines.  I want the excitement and energy of her ealier novels, not some rehashed pulp with her name attached to boost sales.  I hate to say it, but I think I'm about ready to stop reading Krentz and look elsewhere for my romance jollies.  Don't waste your time with this book--go back and read some of her stuff from the nineties & see what a really well-written, exciting, and romantic novel can be like when it's done as well as Ms. Krentz can do 
 I will be succint:  This book is absolutley worthless.  Do not buy it unless you want to feel as ripped-off as I do 
 Romantic story of how Jo hesitates to get into a relationship with a steamy young woman whose feelings for her are more than Jo can manage. I found the story a little slow and "going around in circles": repetitions of how Jo was hurt by her ex Nancy, how she is lonely, has very few friends, and keeps rejecting a persistent Kelly. Not the best lesbian love story out there. 
 The size 52 is like 38 or 36. I had to send it back 
 I got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these.  Unless the bottom of your feet are tough I would not get these 
 A rehash of old info - neither interesting nor compelling. Many other books on building your woodshop are considerably better 
 ..all over the neighbourhood.  now we're getting divorced and it's all YOUR FAULT Male Power Sheer Bong Thong!  i hate you 
 This is by far the most trendy progressive/trance album i have bought in a while. The fact that he is #2 on DJ magazine's prestigious top 100 dj list makes me think that progressive/trance is heading in a bad direction. He should be nowhere near Paul Van Dyke. I own ALOT of progressive/trance albums including one of his earlier releases (and the best in my opinion) In Motion. I also own ASOT 2005 and 2006, and with each one of those releases he sounds more and more cheezy. This whole cd sounds like it could be the soundtrack to the newest "Dance Dance Revolution" for playstation 3. If you like real progressive/trance, and not techno that sounds like it could be heard at chucky cheeses, dont look here. Try Markus Schulz, Paul Van Dyk, ferry corsten, above and beyond, sasha, and digweed just to name a few. The only thing that makes me give this 2 stars and not 1 is the fact that it has a few of his older tracks that are not so bad. 
 Five beginnings in two pages - she lost me.  Too bad because the opening was terrific - a letter in broken English about the dysfunction that led to the adoptions in the first place.  She changed voices, times, places; should have stuck with letter and taken it from there 
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 Some times you pick a great movie, a lot of times you pick a good movie and sometimes you pick a movie that turns your stomach and makes you determined never to do something again (in this time go to the hospital for a routine procedure).   On the back of this DVD box is a quote "Reminiscent of a really great Twilight Zone". Now I love The Twilight Zone and there were many great ones...this doesn't even come close, nor should it be counted in the same ballpark, it is an insult to Rod Serling. I politely suggest that Pete Hammond of Maxim go back and watch some Twilight Zones...  This movie starts on in a somewhat mundane fashion...the main character wakes up just before hitting the ground in a falling dream. It is his 40th birthday and we are told by his loving wife that the procedure the next day is routine and he shouldn't worry. They allude to this dreaded procedure several times before we learn it is a colonoscopy.   He has the procedure, but when he wakes up we are lost trying to figure out what has happened and is happening to poor George Grieves...This movie is not for those with a weak stomach (I finally left the room and told my husband I had had enough). I did come back for the end. While I am now terrified of having a routine procedure done in the hospital (in spite of 5 surgeries in the last 13 years that went well), this movie is best forgotten in my humble opinion.   I put it out here for two reasons though:   1. Just in case your curiosity is peaked and you want to know what grosses me out.  2. In case you were thinking about renting it, buying it, watching it and are now grateful that you know enough to stay the heck away;)  
 I highly suggest anyone who wishes to believe the information in this book examine her sources of evidence, statistical studies, clinical trials,  and objective studies.  As with most critics of stimulant therapy in ADD patients, evidence is secondary concern 
 I must admit I had no idea what they were, but my daughter wanted them.  I was disappointed that all you do is basically rub the pins together to get another color. This color did not last long so you had to keep doing that little process to get the colors to blend.  My daughter who is 7 lost interest quickly.  She uses them like regular markers.  I could have paid 5 dollars for a new pack of markers. As for the material to use them on, she used them all in a couple of hours.  
 the vocals on here are horrible, sounds like a cheap danzig impression. the music is ok but the lyrics are just as bad as the vocals, stupid lyrics like i wish i could make out with her. amy sue is a terrible song. this album would be alot better with a different vocalist and with different lyrics. dont waste your money on this. 
 Buy the other, the All The Pretty Horses alone, with reader Muller (sp?) Frank. Brad Pitt does a very poor job, and I was amazed how poor. He hardly seems like a trained actor. He badly mispronounces Spanish (pronounces 'jefe' as 'jeffy')and his reading is like something a grade-school child would produce. He carries the question tone over to the 'he said' in interrogative sentences and does not change voice tone from one speaker to another. He sounds like a slacker who has been forced to read a high-school composition. This guy is an actor?    And the abridgement ruins the stories in all three novels.  Now I have to go back and buy the other because I love ATPH very much and want to hear it read by someone who has had voice training and a good voice 
 There are certainly a number of interesting story lines in this book but it is written in a breezy lightweight style and follows no discernable pattern or outline. Really this is a collection of short stories around a vague central theme of the efforts of "most" Frenchmen to protect their famous wine collections from the Germans. While certainly the stories from Alsace, Burgundy, Champagne and Bordeaux are decidedly different, there are many connected themes, such as the conflict between passive resistance and active collaboration, that remain unexplored. Further, the actual brutality at the doorsteps of many of these people is glossed over in favor of repeated stories about doctored wines with grand cru labels. This could have been a much better, richer book 
 The author freely reinterprets scripture to suit his agenda, without any convincing logic to support his assumptions.  I was unable to endure much of this book in spite of my desire to really understand an apposing view.  In my opinion, it's just another attempt to invent a social gospel rather than to accept the gospel of salvation 
 I dislike writing negative reviews but I'll make another exception here. My wife showed me this book one lazy Saturday afternoon in a local bookstore. "I want you to look at this. It was such a good idea but he messed it up so badly."  This book should have developed real conjecture on the emotional lives of farm animals. It could have been a serious discussion of what we understand about animal emotions both positive and negative. It would have demonstrated how the natural farming movement has the potential to revolutionize animal husbandry and improve farm animal living conditions. Should have, could have, would have ... it didn't.  He apparantly intuits emotions from these creatures who at the very least do not speak his language and at the most are experiencing very different emotions than the ones he describes. Doubtless he is gifted with superhuman intuitive ability from his years of analytic training; us mere mortals would be unable to consistantly reproduce his observations.  (As a brief example look at the emphasis on eye expressions despite a lack of evidence for any real facial expression translatability across species lines. Urban readers cannot readily observe farm animals to verify this so I'd suggest a trip to the local zoo to test my counter assertion. There, the most casual observer can see that a broad, friendly human smile will send an entire cagefull of monkeys into conniptions. Why? Because many species of simians translate 'smile' as 'teeth-baring dominence display'.)  Nevertheless I rated this book 2 stars instead of one, as there were a few interesting anectdotes interspersed amongst the verbage.  (Edited to add a note about trembling cows.) Cows tremble when they are annoyed by flies. Having no hands their first line of defence is their tail, but flies often land on shoulders and other body parts out of its limited reach. They tremble, shaking their skin to dislodge the pests. They shake their heads, sometimes violently. Their eyes roll and they sometimes look like they're going to fall over. I suppose it is convenient for the writer of this book that flies congregate where cows are penned together but more so that people have forgotten the 2000 year old story of Io, Hera and Zeus. 
 This film is evidence that the Discovery Channel is concerned primarily with entertaining, rather than informing, the public.  It's impossible to have a film that is both scientific documentary and science fiction, because the second any fictional element is incorporated, it is no longer scientific.  The blurring of the lines between science and science fiction on a Discovery Channel program encourages a very non-scientific mindset.  To watch "scientists" in interviews eagerly spouting unsupported speculations makes me sick.    I would have no problem with this film if it aired on the Sci-Fi channel.  Sure, it's entertaining, and it's fun to imagine, but it's irresponsible of the Discovery Channel to show a program like this.  It's completely out of place, considering the rest of its shows are meant to be educational.  For myself personally, it has ruined the credibility of the entire channel 
 This reminded me of a Nancy Drew story in which Nancy gets laid, more than once.  If this seems vulgar, then prepare yourself for a big surprise if you read this book.  Contrived "in the nick of time" encounters hobble the already weak suspense, and stereotypes abound. You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke 
 This version of the Bhagavad Gita is an illegal printing of Kessington Press stolen from Vedanta Press. The Vedanta Press edition is available from Amazon at a MUCH lower price.  Please do not buy the Kessington edition 
 This could have been one of the most important books of the year. Scott Ritter provides important, but tangential, information related to Israel's influence over U.S. foreign policy, the history of the IAEA in Iran, and the theory of regime change as the real reason for U.S. "concern" over Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure.  Unfortunately, Mr. Ritter misses on two counts. First, he offers little direct insight into the Bush administration's policy-making process. And second, someone forgot to edit the book. We are talking about gross grammatical errors, periods in the middle of a sentence, and even a sentence that is punctuated with both a question mark and a period. It is painful to read some of the paragraphs because they are so poorly constructed (at first, I thought my eyes were tired).  At least this book attempts to offer something better than the pablum provided by major media and NPR. It does provide some real insights into the workings of the IAEA, Israeli intelligence and exiled leaders-in-waiting who often lead U.S. policy astray.  Mr. Ritter is at his best when he stays close to his area of expertise - weapons inspections. This topic requires far more than that 
 Talentless people and garbage music  torture you in this turkey-in no time flat,you'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming "MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" out into the yard.Do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense 
  I usually trust Amazon reviewers on movie reviews, but this time ....NO WAY!   This silly, totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment, hoping the movie would liven up.  Sadly, it didn't. To those who rave about the film...you must be in another dimension or something.  Thumbs DOWN. 
 This movie will not start without giong to the scene starter.  Grandchildren cannot start the movi

 I admit that the cup sizes and the reservoir are great.  But the coffee tastes like plastic.  This is not good.  I took this back the next day.  
 The issue of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is a complicated and dramatic part of the history. From both sides, thousands of people died, milions became refugees as a result of the conflict. 20 % of Azerbaijanian lands were occupied by armenians. Fair enough, Azerbaijan blocked it's energy supply to Armenia.   The book fails to present these important facts, rather trying to concentrate reader's attention on the facts protecting armenian side only.  
  While "appauling" says it all, I guess I should elaborate. It's the least I can do, as Cronenberg & Company choose not to.   Jennefir Jason Leigh is awful, as usual, but you can't really blame her or anyone else in the movie. Except of course for having been duped into participating. Ian Holm for Godsakes was awful. All I could think of, was "Bilbo! How did you get mixed up in this?".  But I am quite aware that the characters were not in effect professional actors in ExistenZ as much as they were amuteur actors playing roles within an interactive game. So everyone, apart from JJL gets a free pass.    The movie itself, has been applauded as a work of technogolical philosophy, but it was always and inescapably immersed in Cronenbergs immature fascination with bloody fleshy goofiness and misplaced eroticism. It's as if he's still a six year old boy on the playground, trying to impress the six year old girl on the playground by eating a bug or poking a dead squirrel with a stick. Enough already.    I watched this in a film class so I couldn't turn it off or walk out. I was dreaming of going home and playing with my kids or immersing myself in some competent movie or philosophy but I was stuck.   There is a twist at the end, that may get you or not, but like a long-winded joke, the last minute of intrigue can't hope to justify the other 96 minutes of low brow schlock.  I am also aware that incomprehensibility was planned, and a part of Cronen's art, but the philosophical, metaphysical and technological ideas raised have all been dealt with competently and more effectively in 30 seconds of any decent Simpson's episode.   Mr. Cronenberg, please go back to the school yard. Little girls are waiting to be impressed!  
 you don't really understand how big this thing is until you see the finished product. Which by the way -- there are no finsihed pictures. I actually saw the finished oven on ebay. When it towers over the 6' privacy fence  - you began to rethink making it

 Ok... I get where the other review authors are coming from here, giving this DVD, particularly Troll 2 five stars and a MUST BUY status... irony and sarcasm, and I do understand their views. I thought I'd keep it real though.   Ok, so I bought this double feature DVD for the sole purpose of finally ridding myself of the crappy VHS copy of Troll (1) standing in my shelf beside all the other DVDs. I was surprised that there actually was a sequel to this movie, which, in my book is an 80s classic. Little did I know the horrible truth that was about to unravel before me on the screen. For Troll 2 has to be, THE crappiest movie AND the crappiest sequel EVER made! I don't even know where to start explaining, so that you good people who read this will realize the Supreme suck factor of Troll 2.  All the usual clichees like "low budget" and "bad acting" simply don't suffice! Low budget, for one, is not even synonymous to bad movies. Troll 2 is almost beyond MST3K material. I don't know how else to explain it. Instead I can only ramble on. It's almost like you SHOULD watch this movie if not only for the purpose of study. A study of the precision with which they have managed avoid everything...ANYTHING that makes a good movie. My only comfort is that Troll 2 doesn't relate to the original Troll in any way. Another thing that saves this DVD is that it's cheap, and Troll (1) is actually worth the price. I just wish that Troll 1 would be available on a DVD of its own. The sequel is a damned insult 
 My 2 1/2 year old son loves this book and I think most children familiar with the movie will because it presents familiar characters and situations.  But it feels *so* incredibly tossed off!  The writing is slapdash, lackluster and just pathetically bad.  Good storytelling is more than just hitting the high notes of a film -- if you're going to bother making a book, it should read well *as a book*.  This book lacks the heart and soul that actually "animates" the movie 
 My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive.  Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel.  But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved "turn-a-round".  The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines.  Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey.  Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers.  "Last Call" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to "Gods 
 I must be missing something--but this just isn't in the same league as Electric Outlet or Still Warm or Blue Matter.  I thought track #2 had some moments but for the most part he just noodles over one or two chords 
 This book had potential, but the terrible character developement and choppy flow of the book blew it.  The end leaves you with more questions than the LEFT BEHIND SERIES books do!! 
 Two moderately decent-looking white people who apparently aren't very good at sex go at it in this movie. If that's your thing, why not just rent a bad softcore porn film and be done with it? At least then you won't have to listen to the cornball pseudo-artistic dialogue in this film. What a crock. They could at least have cast a fine young sista like Rosario Dawson or Gabrielle Union to make this movie moan and squeal! This movie makes sex seem boring 
 I did finally get to the end of this book, but it was just out of stubborness. Not worth the effort. A book review of about 10 pages would have been a better way to learn a little about this subject, 
 But apparently Troy Gentry thinks that's perfectly all right. He bought a tame bear named Cubby, locked it in a pen and then shot arrows at it, all in the name of fun.  That behavoir is sickening, and I sincerely hope he gets jail time for it. Please do not support the lifestyle of an animal abuser--this was NOT hunting. THis was torture, plain and simple 
 Homely Estefan is a weak vocalist with no talent to speak of. She can't dance, she can't sing well, and she's nothing to look at. She and J-Lo are the worst examples of modern "superstars". They both get by on the flimsiest of talent. In J-Lo's case, it's her artifically pumped up rear end. Anyway, here we have a bunch of vacuous non-songs, even worse than the first volume. At least that had one decent tune, "Words Get in the Way". This doesn't even have that many good songs. And what's this retread of "Conga" doing here? Yuck! It was bad enough in the original version. My true rating: ZERO STARS 
 I hate the casualties(they are the definition of poser)and this cd really proves they suck the only thing good about this cd is they're not obsessed with PUNX OI OI OI PUNX,they need to give up alread 
 "I've Always Meant To Tell You" was one of the 10 Worst Books I have ever read.  The idea behind this anthology was wonderful, but the end result was less than desirable.  The book is a collection of letters written by women authors to their mothers, some who are deceased and others that are still alive.  Many of the letters seemed to have a "personal" meaning to them that only the mother/daughter would understand; not the reader of the book.  I gave this book a "2 star rating" instead of a "1" because there was great detail about each letter's author and her mother, many including pictures of the two together.  That was the only "positive" attribute in this book.There were only two letters out of the entire book that even began to peak my interest.  This book had a great concept, but was a failure.  (This was the hard back version of the book 
 I'm expecting my first child, and my mother gave me this book because she knows I like animals (especially the cute babies!)  After reading the book, though, I was downright depressed to the point of tears about becoming a mother.  It basically tells you your children will be horrible terrors and not ever appreciate a thing you do, and that your husband will be even worse!  The writing is bitter and twisted compared to the pictures.  I do give a couple stars, because the pictures are cute if you don't read the text 
 This gal is taking Weight Watchers to court.  I wouldn't suggest anyone waste a penny buying this dribble whe writes 
 I cannot believe this book was written by a woman.  Each page is insult after insult.  This author greatly offends me.  I am a stay at home mother and wife. But I am in no mean subservient to my husband, or any man. I am glad this woman could speak her mind and ramble with insanity.  But she is stuck in an era that has long since past.  She needs to get over it and move on. If this is what a "conservative" women sounds like, I just turned liberal real quick 
 I purchased this book with the hope of getting some interesting stories and activities that I could use with my reluctant readers. I was disappointed that the stories, with few exceptions, were bland and uninviting. I was also disappointed with the activities accompanying the stories. All activities encouraged students to imagine a scenario like the one in the story and, using a litery device, write their own narratives. There are no sample essays, narratives, or stories for the students to look at as they begin their own writing. In fact, there are no student activities beyond the writing prompts. Overall, I was disappointed in the lack of innovation and variation in both the stories and the accompanying activities 
 On balance, this book provides a good overview of the subject and of recent academic studies.  However, it is often theoretical and "ivory-towerish."  There is relatively little that really instructs the reader about transactions are actually done.  A great deal of time is devoted to discussing why they occur, but little practical insight is provided as to the challenges and issues that must be resolved.  This book may be suitable for someone who is curious and interested in reading about M&A but provides little guidance for those interested in learning how to undertake transactions 
 I was disapointed when I downloaded it and got 8 pages. As a customer, I expected to have the digital version of the full book and not a summary. I thought that the price difference was due to the absence of paper, printing, handling, shipping, etc. The hardcover version is more than 300 pages; if you take the price per page of the digital version, the hardcover version should cost then ten times more!!! All the examples are referred to that version and nowhere I was said that I was paying 5 dollars for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT.  I honestly believed that I was buying the full book. I will think better before ebuying again... 
 I ordered two of these cots for twin 4-year-old grandsons to use when staying at my home. I expected the cots to be fairly sturdy, perhaps along the line of a porta-crib. Instead, the frame doesn't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily. The twins tried them out -- after being cautioned not to jump on them; the cots didn't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them. I returned the cots to Target

 I enjoy books on skepticism and I was looking forward to reading this one.  Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish it because it is very boring.  Don't bother 
 Like almost everything else from Noontide press, this book is pro-Nazi propaganda, anti-semitic drivel. Unless you're a member of Aryan Nation or Combat 18, this and all their other volumes should be avoided like the intellectual plague that they are 
 I used to be a VCA fan. I even stuck with the books after Neiderman started writing them, and helped run the biggest (at the time) internet fan club for her. I grew out of her books somewhere after the Melody series, and since then haven't read her books that often. However, this book caught my eye. "Dares to break all the rules"! That's what the cover said! So I picked it up, and hey- April is short, sensitive, and overweight. Well, that does indeed sound different, I think to myself. How nice it'll be to read a book with a chubby protagonist, I wondered how the issue of her size would be dealt with.   Well, let me say this: poorly. Very, very poorly. Throughout the entire book April does not once ever think anything nice about herself or her body. She's criticized constantly for her size, and she refuses to stand up for herself. It's not at all an exaggeration to say that at least once every five pages there is some mention of her being "overweight", "obese", "20 pounds too much" or some other phrase that points a negative view on herself. There's huge focus on her dieting and on her sister and father being angry with her for doing things like - oh my god - eating a meal! To say that I was disappointed in this book is an understatement. In a world where there are so many young girls with eating disorders and self esteem and self image issues, this book only goes to further perpetuate it all. It's funny, because I always laughed at the typical moaning of VCA's characters over their "bony collarbones", but at least those characters appreciated their bodies for what they were, in spite of their flaws.   There are other issues in this book - yes, there's a homosexual theme. Yes, it's predictable. There are so many stereotypes floating around in this book that it's ridiculous. Brenda, the jock lesbian. Peter, the Native American whose sole purpose in the story is to tell April about native lore and to "follow the wheel." Of course, there's the chubby April, who's fat because she's lazy and eats too much.   I would say that the one and ONLY positive part of this book is in the way that it deals with Brenda and Celia's relationship - very straightforward and without a lot of explaining. Their relationship just is what it is, and there's not a lot of controversy around it. (You may insert your own controversy if you wish.. 
 Michael Reagan wants your sympathy...he wants you to know that even heartless right wing radio personalities have it tough.  As if anyone was particulary interested, Michael writes a rather flat biography with some fabricated drama thrown in for good measure.  It is not particularly enganging.  Had the book revealed more insight into Ronald Reagan, the man, this might have been an interesting read.  As it stands, does anyone really care what hardships Ronald Reagan's adopted son from his movie star marriage had to endure? From other resources, I have come to find out Michael was not even a big part of Ronnies life during his presidency.  You would not know it by listening to Michaels radio show, however, as he milks his relationship with Ronnie for all it is worth.  This book, as well as his newer "Twice Adopted", are straight-to-Dollar Tree material at best.  I must say, I did have an inkling of sympathy when Michael covers child abuse, as I believe child abusers to be the lowest scum on earth.  But, as right-wing ignorant radio hosts are somewhere on that list, not all that far up, the sympathy quickly fades.  I do feel bad for what happened to him, and admire him for having for having overcome his deamons.  But, I still find the rest of the book to be the ramblings of a miniscule figure in history, who tries to make his association with a former president to be more than it really was.  If you are a fan, by all means dive in 
 This book is taken almost word for word in the intro from the movie "Patton" based on Ladislas' book.  It contains typos such as 'D Day' and also does not give any insight into the man.  Connecting Patton to  Deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two  men.  Patton did not consider war 'great', per se', and should not be  idolized.  He enjoyed it and was excellent at it, however he agonized over  the men he lost.  Perhaps that is the analogy that businessmen should make  today 
 i really like the look of the toaster, and it does a nice job; on one side. the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other - will be trying to get it repaired, or likely, will have to get a new one. 
 On the plus side, this book was cheap and a quick read. However, I found very little tangible, useful information in it. Seemed to be mostly common sense stuff. 
 Don't get me wrong. I'm a raging hippie, who's completely anti-war. And the lyrics on this album are great, and I love the cover of "Imagine" by John Lennon. But it seems that the actual desire to make good *music* fell to the back burner on this one. It's not that the songs are bad per se, but they're all fillers. It's an entire album of fillers, with no really great songs to bring them up. Overall, a disappointment, which is unfortunate, since the wonderful message is lost by the lack of lustre in the music.   If you're new to A Perfect Circle, pick one of the other albums. If you're a veteran, sure, pick it up. But I'd suggest listening to it on random with your other A Perfect Circle and Tool cd's 
 Author is extremely creative photographer, and book is well written.  Great for the amateur photographer who wants more from their photos 
 I am a Navy Wife of four years facing my first deployment as a wife and I found this book to be the corniest thing I've ever read. EVER.  The "comical" stories everyone seems to be gushing over sound like they were pulled right out of a dusty old Reader's Digest. I didn't find the book to be informative and I found the definition section of the book to be incredibly trite and boring.   Example: Term Active Duty, Military Speak: Actively serving and deployable. Spouse Speak: This means your address is written in pencil in address books.  Dear God. How incredibly lame. Military members move. Yes. It's true. We ALL know that. Civilians know this. EVERYONE knows this. This poor attempt at humor is dull and over-used.  I didn't learn ANYTHING from this book and would NOT recommend this to anyone  SERIOUSLY looking for information or advice about military life or deployments. You can get USEFUL information by going to your local Fleet and Family Support Center or attending a pre-deployment brief. 
 Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.  In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.  Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.  When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.  Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.  Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.  Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . . . He's so damned beautiful! And so cruel!" Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest." When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good."  Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . . . they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." "I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.  Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least.  Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it 
 Although the "Everything Dog Book" has some helpful advice about selecting a dog & introducing it to your home, the training methods that it advocates are outdated, unnecessary, inefficient and inhumane.  The reliance on choke chains and forcing behavior are likely to lead to behavioral issues and can have a very negative affect on the relationship between dog and person.  There are far better ways to train a dog to obey that make learning enjoyable and easy for both dog and human.  Better options are: "Dog Training for Dummies", "The Dog Whisperer", and "For the Life of Your Dog: A Complete Guide to Having a Dog From Adoption and Birth Through Sickness and Health". The last two choices in particular are great choices as they offer a wealth of practical information that will apply through the life of your dog. For your dog's sake and your own, try a book that relies on training through positive reinforcement 
 I couldn't tell if I liked the book while I was reading it, so I decided to finish it. I'm still not sure. I think the only reason I liked it at all, was because I wanted to. It's a topic I like, but it didn't really  deliver.  With all the books out there, and only so much time to live, I am  -sure- there are better to choose from 
 This latest translation of the Chinese Taoist Classic is a dry and lifeless specimen, not surprising from a man whose translation of the I Ching was praised for "having no truck with 'timeless wisdom.'" (back cover blurb).  This volume's claim to fame, beyond its slim and attractive appearance, is the complete translation of Wang Bi, a 23 year old commentator from 3rd century CE China.  To determine whether this translation is for you, you should know that Wang Bi had a strong inclination toward political interpretation, a proclivity probably due to the "high official status and prestige" of his family and their role in government and politics [p. 9], a trend furthered by his great-uncle's "Treatise on Keeping One's Person Safe"-which begins by making government secure [p. 10].  (Now there's a Chinese virtue, eh?)  Consider also Wang Bi's answer as to why Confucius never spoke of nothingness while Lao Tzu spoke of it incessantly (as the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things etc.):  "The Sage [Confucius] embodied nothingness so he also knew that it could not be explained in words....Master Lao...constantly discussed nothingness...for what he said about it always fell short [p. 12]."   Now if you believe that someone who could say that actually knew anything firsthand about the Tao, then this book is for you.  And if you are interested in Wang Bi, see Ellen Chen's superb translation/commentary which puts it in perspective.  Otherwise, this is a book on Te-social virtue-where the scholarship is impeccable and the feeling is weak.  And that's the Way it is 
 It was very disappointing to see major actors, cinematographers, and editors doing a good job with decidedly sub-rate material. The film looks much, much better than its story. One begins to have doubts when this family of "geniuses" reveal little intellectual heft in conversation and interaction. The Paltrow character is a virtual cipher whose only talent seems to be finding stashes for her cigarettes, despite her promotion as a "prodigy". The purported love triangle has no apparent basis, in other words, the audience is told to accept the premise without evidence. The problem is that this film was written by people who are not professional, creative writers. Characters must be shown to be "interesting", "conflicted", "in-love", "suicidal", etc. by their words and actions, not simply because we are told they are. This can only be accomplished by subtle and clever writing, which is wholly absent here 
 I bought this unit and noticed the low volume "motorboat" noise almost immediately. E-mailed tech suppport and was told to phone the tech support department to arrange for a replacement. Called the tech support department and was told to return it to the store where I bought it.  Second unit was worse than the first and I'll be returning it for a refund tomorrow.  Nice looking unit but with the mediocre quality and the non-existent tech support its pretty much worthless.  Delphi refuses to aknowledge the problems that have been well documented in many other forums.   
 As some of the other reviewers have said, this book is very watered down.  The names of various utilities and how to install them from the command line & the graphical interface are mentioned, and in some cases a small amount of detail is provided.  This book provided a good starting point for most linux networking utilities but that is about it 
 Having read and enjoyed Kaaterskills Falls by Goodman, I eagerly looked forward to reading this.  However, I found the book a let down. This story gave me the sense that Goodman had written parts of this as short stories and tried pasting them all together.  There were two characters introduced midway through the book for several chapters who were then never heard from again. The first and second halves of the book don't seem to coherently fit together.  I was left feeling like I got introduced to a bunch of different characters, but didn't really get to know any of them very well 
 I can't find anything good to say about this book.  I agree that it's tedious, boring and a waste of money.  I put it down and picked it up and then asked myself 'why', closed it up and put it up.  I was going to sell it here but everyone else who tried to read it beat me to it.  It's not even worth the $.01. 
 Advice on the level of "avoid grizzly bears" and "tigers are dangerous predators"-(actual quotes more or less).  If this is the level of advice you need, this book is for you.  Also recommends catching  and eating tuna and marlin when in a jam. Thanks for the info 
 If you want a book that's all name-dropping with nothing of value to say, then buy this book NOW 
 I rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school.  This video made its rounds in the public schools.  The songs are catchy and the film quality is good.    But make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children.  I will not be showing it to my kids.  Despite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys.    Case in point:  Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father's horse).  She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time.  Juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of "ladies first."  The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron.  The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal.  Our "hosts", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting.  There should be a law against using Mel Brooks' voice for a baby.  Apparently, I repressed memories of these creatures, but seeing them again brought back the horror.  Needless to say, I fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry.  Overall, this DVD is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children 
 The music does not play well.  It takes many, many cranks for it to start and then it is very faint 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 We were led to believe that this book was geared for children because of the trading cards included.  However, the subject matter is crude and offensive on many pages.  I would definitely not recommend this book for children.  I also think that the contents reflect the downward spiral in our culture and therefore, would not recommend it for adults either 
 Terrible and boring! He leaves info out that was later all addressed and dismissed in court. He tries to report after only six months on the case.An opportunist 
 I opted for a less expensive heart waffle iron based on the Cuisinart name.  Yuck.  Although the redlight/greenlight is a nice feature the waffles were paper thin and quite frankly weren't worth the effort.  I had ordered one for me and one for a gift.  Phew...was I glad I tested it first and then returned the one I planned to give as a gift.  I guess I just have to spring for the big bucks if I want waffles that are easy to make.....AND taste like waffles 
 1. It didn't teach me anything I hadn't already read in other books or learned on my own.  2. Stressed the importance of medication and ignored the plight of those (like me) who have tried pretty much every med on the market and experienced no relief from symptoms.  3. I was personally offended by the brief discussion of antidepressant side effects which, when mentioning sexual dysfunction, focused solely on MALE sexual dysfunction and completely ignored the fact that most females on antidepressants cease to experience orgasms. Apparently I'm a filthy whore who shouldn't be concerned with my sexual enjoyment 
 The Gods of War is the end of the Emperor books and written kind of like a soap opera. This book really wasn't that good nor did I really enjoy reading parts of it. I very much felt that the ending was rushed(the ending is when Caesar goes to Rome from Egypt). Caesar was Dictator For Life for about a year and did some things, which are all hastely described. Another big issue is Brutus. He just decides to go along with the members of the Senate to destroy Caesar with only this reason: "Caesar never honors me and I'm sickened by his glory". This is not reason enough to go and kill someone well, at least not to me. Not only do I have a problem with Brutus, Servilla loses all of her charm in this book. All she does is sit around, thinking about the past. The plot to destroy Caesar is never really described and seems very passive, although it most certainly was not. Iggulden also uses the line "And you too, Brutus?", although in real life, Caesar said "And you too, my boy?" and he said it in Greek. More altered history. The only really good things about this book is when Caesar is fighting Pompey and when he is in Egypt. Speaking of Egypt, Iggulden seems to forget what he wrote in Book 2. When Caesar's son is being born, Brutus asks were you like this when Julia was being born and Caesar says I don't think so. Caesar didn't even know his wife was carrying his child when he left and he was kidnapped by pirates while Julia was being born. Also, in the book, Caesar names his son Ptolemy Caesarion while in real life, his son's name was Pothinus Caesar. Even in the Historical Note, Mr.Iggulden says this, why did he write otherwise? With all it's MAJOR flaws, this book really isn't a good way to end the Emperor series.    
 I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment 
 * Numerous times, we hear about the preparation to some activity, then cut to months later, and it's already happened. * Certain subtle actions are, for no good reason, not explained to the reader, who really has to know who's doing what and why.  * Poorly edited -- more than once, I was like, "What?" and read a paragraph aloud to try and figure out what it meant, but was still stymied. * I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Numerous times I found myself skimming, trying to get to something interesting.  * Gave up halfway through.   All in all, pointless. Winegardner gives it a good try, but he doesn't have the feel for the mob or the people that Puzo had. I don't believe it's purely the publisher trying to reanimate a dead corpse, but it's pretty close. 
 How can you write a book about the Battle of the Bulge and have no maps. I knew when he said oral history there would be no detailed analysis of the battle 
 My family thinks that this is the best toilet paper available.  
 Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!! 
 What we have here is yet another Beatles fan trying to show off what he knows about their songs, and attempting to "explain" it all.  If more accurate histories are to be trusted, the Beatles themselves, particularly their prime movers, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, didn't have a great deal in mind when they wrote these songs.  Nevertheless, far too many authors, including this one, have churned out volumes of "explanation and interpretation" of Beatles songs, what they really mean, how they reflect the 1960s social and political scene, and so on.  The last thing we needed was another one, particularly by an author who, despite his credentials as a classical music writer, is strictly another amateur Beatlemaniac posing as an authority.

 This book is a feeble attempt to slam a politician. There's nothing constructive here, just liberal whinning. 
 I'm not sure how accurate this test is.  I gave it to my 8 year old daughter who finished it in about 20 minutes vs. the 45 minutes that they are allowed.  She scored 80/100 which doesn't register until age 11.  At age 11 an 80/100 is equivalent to an IQ of 163 -- a genius???  She is incredibly bright and is in the gifted program at school, however a "genius" I'm not too sure of.    I hardly know anything about IQ testing for this age bracket, however I do know that the types of questions on this test are taught to the students in our school district early in the First and Second Grades.  I find it hard to believe that a 12-14 year old taking this test would score anything less than 100% or at the "genius" level.    So, I gave it two stars because it doesn't hurt anything to have your child take the test.  However keep in mind that this test probably shouldn't be taken too seriously.  If your child's IQ is a big concern for you, having a psychologist provide the testing would be a more accurate option. 
 Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. 1 Ladies...series.  No comparison.  The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book.  I just don't understand the rest of this book.  Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face.  The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book?  I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read 
 Not that the author has not been scholastically thorough in his presentation of what he deems "facts", but there is with this book more than meets the eye.  As a Philadelphian and as a member of The Nation of Islam, I know and grew up observing many of Mr. Griffin's principal subjects and, quite frankly, it isn't as simple as he makes it seem.    Yes, there was corruption and crime in Black Philadelphia in the 1970's, and some of it was clearly the work of those who dubiously identified themselves as Nation members.  However, to use the terms "Black Muslims" (Nation of Islam) and "Black Mafia" interchangably would be a gross error for too many reasons to cite in this space.  Suffice it to say that some of the men that Mr. Griffin would paint with the broad brush of suspicion have been either penitant for their crimes, vindicated by the legacy of their extraordinary children, or both...  In short, this treatise and its oddly coincidental release date (concurrent with the widely reported trial of a Muslim cleric in Philadelphia) could also stand to come under some "investigation". Wise readers will take all of the above and more into account when reading this, all the while remembering that the "Black Mafia" is no more, but the glorious history of Islam in Black Philadelphia continues to flourish today, in spite of the best efforts of its detractors 
 Like others have mentioned this is not the sturdiest of toys.  You MUST place it on a solid level surface, otherwise it wobbles and pieces disconnect/fall apart.  From a parents perspective, I am greatly disappointed with the overall quality.  This was obviously not well thought out.  It was designed to be easily broken down for storage.  Unfortunately... too easily, and playing with it is sometimes troublesome, especially when little hands are trying to deal with the small space that the scale of Polly Pocket toys demand.  That being said, my daughter loves it and has not stopped playing with it for two days now.  For a child that gets bored with a single toy quite easily, that is a ringing endorsement that can not be put fully into words.  Best recommendation... if you are going to buy this, wait for a sale 
 An extremely informative series (Biology of plants versions) well written and in depth.  They ruined it with the 7th edition however, by putting two chapters( the ones on ecology) on the internet.  So the book, even though it says it's 800 and some pages, actually is thinner than the old 6th version.  Our teacher couldn't believe they had done this, as this was part of the curriculum.  So, not only would we have to pay about $120 for this book, but also have to print about 100 pages.... That's a sick way to make more money out of books, i'm tired of book companies screwing students just to make some more money.  I returned the 7th edition and got the 6th edition, which has basically the same information and ALL the chapters included in the book!  I don't like being this harsh, because i absolutely love the information this book has.  Reading it has added another dimension to my understanding of plants.  The Ecology chapters missing in the 7th edition are awesome reads, however and probably contain the best real world information that students should have.  As such, i have to praise the 6th edition for it has changed my life for the better!!! : 
       I hated this book!  Or maybe I was just rooting for C.J. to get his stuff together in the third book and have Joe Pickett ready to fly for another twenty years.  It's what I expected anyhow.  Didn't happen.   	    The first Joe Pickett story seemed a little tall and convoluted, but the yarn was spun tightly and with dexterity and wit.  I couldn't put it down.  You knew that C.J. Box and Joe Pickett would be around for a long while.  The second book had me looking forward to more Joe Pickett yarns in spite of exploding cows.  An audience was building.  Word was getting around that C.J. Box could keep you interested.  It was time for Pickett to settle down a bit, ease off the fantastics, and start a long career.  Then he fell off the mountain.       WINTERKILL opens with a humiliating and extremely unlikely scene of a Forest Supervisor's "nervous breakdown" that contributes nothing substantial to the story.  From there, it traverses a litany of extremes.  Our humble, heroic game warden in remote Wyoming is forced down a gauntlet of sociopathology, psychopathology, political aberrations, weather extremes, bureaucratic obstruction and cover-up, and the killing of a carefully developed sympathetic character.  Then, incredibly, staight-arrow Joe Picket becomes complicit in a felony that will never be discovered.  	    C.J. Box is a clever, compelling writer, but I don't see how Joe Pickett will ever recover from this dark detour.    
 This book is written in an engaging fashion for younger readers, so that's why I gave it 2 stars. But I found the attitudes conveyed towards slavery, Native Americans, and Democrats unsettling. I think there are some political motives behind this book. I think the author is trying to indoctrinate youngsters into ultra-conservative Southern Republican political ideas, and a brand of Christianity that makes people outside the church (you know, the OTHER people God loves) think Christ-followers are hateful and crazy.   For example, on p36 it states, "Although it is true that Native Americans were often treated badly by European settlers, they treated one another worse" and "We cannot feel so much pity for the Native Americans when we think of all this." Did they have it coming? They faught and killed each other like every other group of humans on the planet, so we shouldn't feel bad about the injustices perpetrated by white European settlers that the Natives have never recovered from?  And on the two pages that deal with slavery, it is mentioned that the slave trade was profitable for the traders, but "hard on the slaves" who were shipped to the colonies "under difficult conditions." A bit of an understatement.   And, on the subject of the Civil War, "Many people in the south did not own slaves, but they knew how quickly the Southern economy and standard of living would be damaged if the Northern politicians forced Southern farmers to immediately free their slaves." Yikes, what about the slaves' standard of living? No where is it mentioned or even alluded to that slavery in the US was BAD and WRONG. It's not okay to own another human being and treat him or her like an animal (or WORSE).   The reason the North abolished slavery? They had MACHINES to do the work of slaves, so slaves became obsolete. And I quote, "...why slavery was done away with in the Northern states. The reason is primarily that Northern businessmen did not need slave labor to operate their stores and factories because they made much greater use of the new machines that cut down on the amount of hand labor that was necessary to complete a job." No mention of how compassionate Christians (and others) were vehemently opposed to the way slave owners viewed, kept and treated their slaves, or what they did to abolish slavery.  Finally, the treatment of Democrats and Republicans is really unbalanced. The only things mentioned about Carter? How horrible he was for establishing relations with China, that he messed up with the Panama Canal, and his debaucling of the Iran hostage situation. "In short, our country had sunk to new lows during the Carter years." Clinton's claims to fame are creating a huge government against the Constitution and the will of the people (who promptly reelected him), meddling in Bosnia and other war-torn nations, promoting homosexuality, and Monica Lewinsky. (WHY are these last two issues in a book for 9-year-olds?) In contrast, the Repubs get ONLY positive press in this text.  Finally, the book also says on p178, "Sadly, our country's Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that it was illegal for children to pray in the public schools." That's not true. That law pertains to adult-led corporate prayer, but does nothing to prevent a CHILD from praying in school.  If this book is in line with your political views, then you might want to buy it. But I have a hard time believing that anyone in this day and age thinks SLAVERY was really not such a bad thing. For that reason, no one should by it. This text could be supplemented with something more truthful regarding slavery, like a parent-censored version of "The Slave Narratives," which records hundreds of interviews with former slaves about their lives as slaves and after emancipation. 
 This book is anything but a comprehensive guide.  The author fails to go into verbose detail on almost every problem, leaving you guessing how she came to that conclusion.  That would be fine if this was an advanced trig book, but it's the DUMMIES guide and as such I'd expect to be taken through every step of every problem.  There's plenty of room for this; there are huge margins which could have been used to fill in more detail.  It also completely fails to explain trig identities in a sensible way, which if you're a student struggling with challenging trig identity problems, this book won't be of any help 
 Alan Dershowitz is deaf, dumb and blind and anyone who doesn't realize this needs help quickly. He has twisted and turned facts so that he can justify his stance with the OJ deal. OJ murdered Nichole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. Anyone who can have their brain muddeled by the ravings of this Dershowitz lunatic, needs a dose of reality. OJ was found not guilty in the criminal trial because of, 1.The shenanigans by Johnny Cochroach, Flea Bailey, Carl Douglas, Barry Sheick (spelled wrong) and most importantly Judge Ito, 2. The ignorant, and uneducated jurors who couldn't find their way out of a brown paper sack. Folks, I hate to break the news to you, but there is no "Tooth Fairy"... 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 As one reviewer so eloquently pointed out, Anne Marie Oliver and Paul Steinberg show a complete disregard for political and social factors in their extremely superficial and biased analysis of suicide terrorism. In order to describe the true motives behind suicide attacks, one must look into the root causes of suicide terrorism. Contrary to popular belief, a typical suicide bomber is not a religious zealot seeking to destroy the West because he abhors our liberal values. In point of fact, most suicide bombers are secular individuals, as corroborated by the fact that the group responsible for most suicide attacks in the world the Tamil Tigers are adamantly opposed to religion. Admittedly, religion is often used as a tool to recruit new suicide bombers by promising them eternal life in paradise. Nonetheless, religion is by no means a primary motive behind suicide terrorism. While its importance should not be downplayed or denied, it only plays a secondary role.   Robert Pape has in my opinion conducted the most meticulous and comprehensive study of suicide terrorism. What makes Pape's study so superior to every other book on suicide terrorism is that it refuses to make simplistic and unsubstantiated claims. It delves deep into the root causes of suicide terrorism and is not afraid to ask the dangerous questions. Pape's study demonstrates without a doubt that most suicide bombers are driven primarily by political motives. According to Pape, the principal motive of suicide bombers is to obliterate the presence of foreign powers from the areas that suicide bombers consider to be their homelands. Therefore, simply labeling a Palestinian suicide bomber as a religious fanatic driven solely by religious motives is a gross overgeneralization and oversimplification. Most Palestinian suicide bombers have divulged that their primary motive is to fight the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and to relieve the suffering of their people. They believe that the only way to fight a much more powerful adversary is to resort to suicide missions. In the view of the Palestinian suicide bombers all targets are legitimate since they are at war with Israel. They also believe that they have the right to retaliate against the Israeli killing of the Palestinian children and women which Israel by the way conveniently labels as the "collateral damage".   Understanding suicide terrorism does not suggest in any way that it is morally justifiable. But if we really wish to understand its root causes then we must tell the truth and refrain from making sensationalistic albeit incorrect and misleading conclusions. People who live under the Israeli occupation are subjected daily to humiliation and derogatory comments. They live in abject poverty where desperation, despair and hopelessness are omnipresent. It is out of these gruesome conditions that suicide terrorism emerges. Imagine being humiliated and mistreated every day in your own country by an extremely powerful bully. What would you do?   All these factors are somehow overlooked or at best downplayed in this book. Subsequently, the conclusions are erroneous, inaccurate and biased. I recommend Robert Pape's brilliant book Dying to Win The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism and John Esposito's Unholy War Terror in the Name of Islam. In addition to these books, I recommend an extremely powerful and disturbing movie Paradise Now.     
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
 In this book, Michael Moorcock, being of the breed of fantasy author who has tried so desperately to come off as a "real" writer because everyone looks at fantasy writers as juvenille hacks, discusses at length his windbag opinions about the current state of fantasy fiction as well as its past. The essays contained within this book are long-winded, pretentious rubbish that should be avoided by everyone except diehard Michael Moorcock fans. This guy has the gall to bash guys like Tolkien and Robert E.Howard, thinking he's some kind of literary genius because of his teen-fave Elric books that are supposed to be so deep and introspective but in reality are nothing more than over-worded, whiny drivel unpalatable by anyone over the age of 25. Spare us, Mr. Moorcock. The Elric books are the only half-decent thing you've ever written, and you've been riding on the fame you accrued from them ever since. Get over yourself. You're not that great a writer and a little modesty would do you a lot of good 
 This is DFW show-off opus, where he uses verbosity to club the reader over the head until they are senseless and *think* they really understand what he's talking about.  I wonder if this whole work is a cruel joke; to see if we "get it".  This is a book to tackle (and I mean that word) when you're stranded on a desert island with no other choices.  Otherwise pick up one of his collections of non-fiction 
 I just paid $1.00 for this book, and overpaid.  The book seems limited to what the author likes to do, not what you may choose to do.   For instance: 1. Kitchner for Stockinette is fully explained, but far from the best I've seen.  For Garter, only the warning that ii is more complicated, and one illustration, but no written instructions.  For Ribbing, just the warning that it's too hard for her. 2. There is no mention of steeks, not even in the glossary.  Even if the book doesn't cover the subject, it should be included in any list of knitting terms. 3.  The original owner of the book had written a question about measuring guage swatches on or off the needles.  After reading the author's section on guage, I'm not surprised.  Her swatching method leaves much to be desired, and in spite of several warnings about measuring not only the swatch but the work in progress several times to be sure the guage stays even throughout the garment, it was not explained that the swatch should be blocked as the finished garment will before being measured. Remember that size 6 sweater that became a 15 when washed and blocked?  If only you'd blocked the swatch first.  THese are just three of the shortcomings I spotted in a quick review.  I doubt I'll even explore the book farther, but at least I didn't pay full price.  All in all, a great disappointment, even at $1.00, and perhaps not deserving of even the one star minimum rating 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 Jan Tomasz Gross' book "Neighbors:  the Destruction of  the Jewish Community in Jedwabne" was first published in Poland in early 2000 (under the Polish title `Sasiedzi: Historia Zaglady Zydowskiego Miasteczka'), and appeared in 2001 in American (English-language) and German editions.  `Neighbors' describes how a massacre of a number believed to be 1,600 Jews on July 10, 1941, in the village of Jedwabne near Lomza in northeastern Poland, which had hitherto been generally believed to be carried out by the German military, was actually carried out with Polish participation - according to Gross' account, it was organized and carried out by Poles, with German acquiescence.  The accusation that Poles were responsible for the Jedwabne massacre had an enormous impact on Polish public opinion.  A Polish governmental commission, the Institute of National Memory (Instytut Pamieci Narodowej, IPN) was charged with conducting a detailed investigation. IPN's findings were detailed in a 1500 page, two-volume study entitled `Wokol Jedwabnego' which unfortunately is presently available only in Polish. IPN's findings were made public on July 9th, 2002.    Gross' account in `Neighbors' is now known to be true in part, and in part inaccurate.  The fly-leaf of the hardcover edition of `Neighbors' summarizes the story as follows: `One summer day in 1941, half of the Polish town of Jedwabne murdered the other half - 1,600 men, women and children - all but seven of the town's Jews.'  According to IPN's investigation, this statement is inaccurate.   (1)   "1,600 (Jewish) men, women and children" were murdered (this statement in Gross' `Neighbors' has been repeated many times).  In fact, Jedwabne in 1941 did not have 1,600 Jewish inhabitants. An IPN historian, Jan Jerzy Milewski, found a 1940 Soviet NKVD document in the archive in Grodno showing that in Jedwabne in 1940 there were about 560 Jews.  Thus a year before the massacre, a Soviet census found the Jewish population of Jedwabne to be approximately one-third the number given by Jan T. Gross in `Neighbors'.  IPN's exhumation of the Jedwabne victims was interrupted at the request of the invited supervising Jewish rabbi that the remains of the victims not be further disturbed.  The best estimate of IPN's chief forensic investigator, Prof. Andrzej Kola, was that there were between 300 and 400 victims.  IPN concluded: `The figure of 1,600 victims or so seems highly unlikely, and it was not confirmed in the course of the investigation.'  (2)  `The Germans' direct participation in the mass murder.....was limited, pretty much, to their taking pictures' (Gross, `Neighbors'). This is false. In reality, IPN found, the day began "with the herding of Poles to the town square, which was done, according to witnesses, jointly by the German gendarmes, i.e. policemen and the people from the collaborating administration. In the testimonials there is mention of the fact that German policemen hit some of the Jedwabne Poles in the face with rifle butts or their hands, which is evidence that some of them did not want to go to the town square." The Germans then distributed bats and clubs to the Poles, to use as weapons against the Jews.  At the Jedwabne town square, the Germans were in charge.  The Germans were not in Jedwabne just as photographers, as Gross would have readers believe.  The Germans were in Jedwabne as organizers.  (3) "Half of the Polish town" murdered the other half: This is not accurate.  IPN, after interviewing 98 persons of whom about one-third were first-hand witnesses, concluded that "approximately at least forty men" were Polish perpetrators in the murder (but not "one half of the town" as stated on the fly-leaf of `Neighbors', which would have required over one thousand participants; Gross himself, in `Neighbors,' claims to have ninety-two names of Polish participants). Whether ninety-two according to Gross or "at least forty" in IPN's findings, the number of Polish participants in the Jedwabne massacre was not one-half of the village, but closer to one-twentieth.  An ACCURATE English-language version of IPN's principal findings, about 3 pages long, can be found on the Internet by going to `The Jedwabne Tragedy' at Buffalo University's `info-Poland' website, and then to `Jedwabne, July 10th, 1941: an interview with Prof. Pawel Machcewicz.'  Gross' book "Neighbors' was spectacularly successful in provoking an intensive two-year debate in Poland on the subject of Polish-Jewish relations.  An excellent collection of papers from that debate, in English translation, has been published under the title `The Neighbors Respond' edited by Joanna Michlic and Professor Antony Polonsky of Brandeis University.  `The Neighbors Respond' is not a rebuttal to `Neighbors', but examines the subject from many viewpoints. Those who want to better understand the subject, including what anti-Semitism was, and was not, in Poland, will learn far more - and in far greater depth - from `The Neighbors Respond'  than from reading `Neighbors' alone.  The greatest shortcoming of `Neighbors' is its inadequate treatment of events leading up to the 1941 Jedwabne massacre.  Gross never tells readers of `Neighbors' the most important thing which happened during the 1939 - 1941 Russian occupation of eastern Poland: the four massive deportations, from February 1940 to June 1941 (see Jan T. Gross, `Revolution from Abroad,' 2002 edition, pages 194-222, 262).  These deportations were atrocities, with women and children "packed in a standing position in sealed, windowless, and unheated cattle-wagons, for a winter journey of three, four, five or even six thousand miles.......instances of derangement, frostbite, starvation, infanticide and even cannibalism occurred."   (Norman Davies, `God's Playground,' Vol. 2, pages 448-449).    In Jedwabne, the deportation round-ups in June 1941, only a few weeks before the massacre, are described by IPN: "(Soviet) NKVD agents in groups of three, accompanied by members of the local militia, came looking for families of persons arrested or persons who had gone into hiding.  Jewish militia volunteers escorted the deportees, so they - in the eyes of many local Poles - were to blame for everything."   Many Jews in eastern (not in central) Poland, collaborated with the Russian occupation.  In many places, Jews welcomed Russian invaders.  Jewish-Soviet collaboration embittered Polish-Jewish relations during World War II and its aftermath.

  I read on page 56--      "But while there is life, not everything is lost. The darkest hour is just before the dawn. To repent and feel remorse for a life wasted is to go into mourning for a past that has not been lived. Temporary depression is the condition of spiritual growth - it's hibernation of a life that retires into itself and prepares to return renewed. From the extreme limits of pain, as in childbirth,, there bursts forth indescribable happiness, a flood of love."  There's something seriously wrong here 
 I was so excited about ordering this (sad, I know!).  I liked the idea that this vac was human-powered, and that it would allow me to do quick clean-ups between regular vacuuming.    I was disappointed at how cheap the handle was, and how easily it came apart.  Basically, in order to ship the thing in a small box, the handle comes in 3 pieces.  You have to put them together -- the round tubes just "slide" into each other.  Unfortunately the pieces are not threaded, and don't stay together terribly well. If I had a really old vac that needed to be held together with duct tape, that's one thing.  However, I'm not keen on having to duct tape brand new things.    The pickup was okay, but not great.  After a few passes, there was still dirt on my tile floor.  It occured to me that I had not found the magic vac of my dreams, so I ended up sending it back 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 I have a fairly new computer (Fujitsu S7110 laptop) and this SW won't run on it. It installs without any error. Clicking on the program icon results in nothing happening. As a test I installed it on my desktop (a CyberpowerPC) and it runs just fine. But, I need it on my laptop, not my desktop. It doesn't do me any good while on the road to be running on my home machine. I called tech support and they basically had me disable all the boot time software and services and, yes, the software does run. But is that really a solution? It's more like a kludge. The software has issues and Magellan doesn't want to admit it. The Magellan web site hints that version 2.0 of DirectRoute won't run on all DVD drives, but they don't provide a solution.  I asked if they would upgrade me to version 3.0 and they said no.  This software was essentially a waste of money for me.

 "Splinter of the Mind's Eye" is the very first Star Wars novel set in the Expanded Universe.  The only Star Wars book before "Splinter" is the novelization of "Star Wars", also written by Alan Dean Foster.  Because this book came out before there was even a script for "The Empire Strikes Back", things happen in the book that doesn't quite jive with what we know from "Empire" and "Jedi".  I'm not sure there is a direct contradiction, but the story fits better into the Star Wars Universe when the reader knows that this novel was written without any knowledge of "The Empire Strikes Back".  Think of "Splinter" as, perhaps, the red-headed stepchild of the Star Wars novels.    This novel takes Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa and puts them on a diplomatic mission for the Rebellion to a planet which has some sympathizers.  On their way to this planet, the ship Luke and Leia are on crash lands on a primitive jungle planet occupied by the Empire, human miners, and a host of strange alien creatures.  As Luke soon learns, it is also the home of the Kaiburr Crystal, a crystal which magnifies the power of Force Users.  In the hands of the Empire this crystal could be a dangerous tool and weapon.  Since Luke and Leia have no idea how to get off the planet with their damaged ship, they decide to search for this crystal.  The novel gives a fairly fast paced, though simple, adventure story featuring run-ins with Imperial Stormtroopers, natives, and Darth Vader in a face off that foreshadows what will come in future movies.    "Splinter" suffers from being a little bit on the cheesy side, as if it were geared to a younger audience.  It also suffers from the timing in which it was written, namely before George Lucas had conceived of "The Empire Strikes Back".  This last part isn't the fault of Alan Dean Foster or the novel itself, but this does affect the perceptions of someone reading the book in 2005.  Knowing what we do about the characters, the budding romance between Luke and Leia is a bit uncomfortable (as it still is looking back at "A New Hope" and how Luke looks at Leia).    This isn't an exceptionally good novel even by Star Wars standards, but it is a time capsule of where the Star Wars novels came from and as the first Extended Universe novel, it's interesting in that perspective.  There's really no other reason to read this book, though, as it doesn't tie into any other Star Wars novel (or movie) or fill in any gaps left by a Star Wars novel.    -Joe Sherr 
 As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, I can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever. I got this book based on the glowing reviews I found here, and I'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it.  The most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle "An Integrated Approach to Security in the Organization." The book not only lacks effective security integration techniques, it doesn't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration. 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 I've only watched the first six episodes so far, waiting for some in depth story to unfold with diverse characters... blah blah blah.  Nothing but a simple story line with everything spelled out.  There's no complexity to it, no unfolding of the characters, no mystery of peeling through the layers of their lives.  All the episodes seem so long and dragged out but nothing different ever really happens.  Boy tries to save girl, boy gets beat up, boy does what he feels is right without thinking it through, no strategy, no thought to his actions.  It almost seems like a Saturday Morning Cartoon with violence and unnecessary rape suggested scenes.  Another thing that really bugs me is the fact that the evil King Hamdo is such a whiny coward, but yet somehow manages to recieve complete obedience from all his subjects.  Somebody would have dethroned him by now, in fact there was an assassination attempt where the two assassins were skilled enough to sneak all the way into his chambers with out being noticed, kill his guards, have him in there sights, and not only miss him, but stand out in the open only to be shot by his scared shaky hand from under his desk.  The actions and reactions of this world are just to unrealistic.  I want my wasted hours back.  Good thing this only cost me twenty dollars  
 Creed's over rated music sounds much like a wet fart after a night out drinking lots of Guinness and chain swallowing chicken wings.... can you feel the wind scotty??? does it take you higher??  
 i found this to be a highly overrated album. it was unexciting and unoriginal, and there was nothing at all edgy about it. in fact, there was an anti-drug song on it! now, i dont like drugs at all myself, but there is no place for an anti-drug song on what is supposed to be a good, threatening punk rock record. do yourself a favor and but something by the stiff little fingers, the stooges, the damned, crass, or something like that 
 I was looking for a Cussler-esque adventure for my recent vacation and read a few reviews of DuBrul's books.  They seemed mostly positive, so I bought a couple thinking they would be good for long airplane flights, afternoons in the sun, etc.  Sadly, both Charon's Landing and Vulcan's Forge were mind-numbingly slow, the action sequences were nothing special, the characters were wooden stereotypes, the heroes were no better than the villains, etc.  There really was nothing to hold my attention from chapter to chapter.  Mercer (the hero) acts like a pubescent boy looking down the top of every blouse and up the slit of every skirt, and DuBrul can't seem to write a decent piece of dialogue between a man and a woman.  Ultimately, I read both books, but it took the better part of a month to get through them (I usually read a Clive Cussler novel in about 2 days) because I kept putting them down and picking up other books that held more promise.  I won't be buying any more DuBrul 
 This book was recommended to me by a relative, and I purchased it based on her suggestion. It was disappointing when I realized within a few pages that its viewpoints relate more closely to a fundamentalist/conservative slant than to the God of my faith. I offered the book to another family member, with brief comments that I didn't care for it much. She suggested that I should be more open-minded. Yikes! That is exactly the opposite of my problem with this book. For example, it seems to me that a person who is open-minded just isn't going to be inspired by the statement that "God isn't who we want him to be." In my opinion, God is more perfect than we can fathom, and that IS precisely who we want Him to be 
 As a Will Ferrell fan I will go easy.  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Had I seen this in the theaters I would have demanded my money back. 
 After seeing the travesty that was episode one in the theatre I decided to give this one a try, assuming that it couldn't possibly get any worse. Was I right? Oh man, I was worse than right. I was wrong. The weak character development that took place with Anakin Skywalker in no way led me to believe that this person could eventually become Darth Vader. The character Anakin is such an undisciplined whiney little brat that it becomes utterly unbelievable that this kid could become a dreaded supervillian. On top of that, the chemistry between him and Padame was very weak. The supposed romance between them was devastated by mediocre acting and no real interesting dialogue.  So once again the special effects department has broken their backs carrying this movie. Without a strong plotline or interesting characters, this movie becomes not a story, but just an impressive light show. It seems as if George Lucas figured that if the technology that he has now is light years ahead of what he had twenty five years ago, then the audience won't need anything else. The special effects in the three 'prequel' movies was so inconsistent with the older films that they should have been released as a completely different story alltogether.  And finally we get to Yoda. A puppet that can bounce around and defy gravity with a lightsaber, but still needs a cane to walk. In the older films, Empire Strikes Back for example, Yoda was balancing on Luke's feet during his handstand. When Luke lost his balance and fell over, wouldn't Yoda be able to just use the force and gently float to the ground instead of tumbling to the ground out of control with him? Is that because of lack of special effects technology back then, or just Yoda was getting too old to use the force anymore? Just a little food for thought. I'll let you decide.  So once again the only plus in this film is the impressive visual effects. If your expecting more however then George Lucas will once again let you down 
 The book tells us little about Shakespeare himself. Rather, it is a chronicle of Elizabethan times in England. We learn more about his contemporaries, e.g. Johnson, than we do about Shakespeare. There is even more information in the book that touches on the physical layout of the Globe Theater than the playwrite. The book is, however, a fairly concise, yet informative listing of his plays 
 After having read the book, I was left with a mixed feeling. The content of the book is OK. Not special, just OK. If this book changed your way of thinking about risk, then this is probably one of your first books you read on the subject. I give the book content 4 stars, since it's decent, easy to follow and fairly complete. Besides that, the author included three good articles at the end of the book, one of which (by Caroline Hamilton) is particularly well-written.  Now for the style. I can only agree with one of the other reviewers regarding the comment he made about proofreading the book. I wonder if the book was proofread at all. There are so many errors and annoyances in this book, it starts working on my nerves fairly quickly. To name but a few:   The writer contradicts himself on several occasions. Sometimes this gets hilarious: - Page 30: [The cost/benefit analysis] is the most important step of any risk analysis process. - Page 35: As discussed in the previous example, the scope statement is the most important element of the risk analysis process. - Page 39: The most important element of any risk analysis process is the recommendations of controls and safeguards... etc etc.   I understand that mister O'Leary is his mentor, but don't tell me five $%^$@ times that he is the Director of the Education Resource Center (pages ix, 12, 13, 65, 66).   The spelling errors are a real pain in the butt:  - page 217: "Aurebach" instead of "Auerbach" (my favorite; it's his own publisher). - page 16: "can shared" instead of "can be shared" - page 36: ".appropriate" instead of "appropriate" - page 43: "their role" instead of "his role" - page 45: "control" instead of "risk" (last word on the page) - page 46: "these" instead of "there" - page 47: "guideline" instead of "guidelines" - page 55: "their" instead of "its" (it refers back to "job") - page 64: wrong comma usage - page 71: "in" instead of "it" - ..... - page 162: "Originizational" instead of "Organizational" - page 217: "Ozierz's" instead of "Ozier's"   The writer uses the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V too many times. Definitions should be reworded, not blindly copied. See pages 7 and 57, pages 47 and 72 etc.  Sometimes bulleted items in the same list have a trailing dot, sometimes they haven't.  I can go on and on.  To wrap it up, the writing gets 1 star. Equals 5 stars. Which will be rounded to 2 stars, simply because of his sloppy writing. If the writing were better, I might give it 3 or 4 stars 
       The Italian-American author John Fante, who was raised in Colorado, wrote novels such as Ask the Dust (recently made into a film) that chronicled the discrimination he felt in the Anglo world, and how he externalized his self-consciousness by assailing the next convenient target--who in Dust happened to be a Mexican barmaid. Tom Tancredo, an  Italian-American congressman from Colorado, also externalizes his self-consciousness in an Anglo world--except that for him conscience does not get in the way of out-bigoting the bigot.  It is easy to imagine Trancredo thinking "We were discriminated against--now it's our turn to discriminate."     Then again, the rabid right-winger Tancredo may only be cognizant of the times when he discriminated against blacks and Hispanics. It may come as a surprise to him, but this country has a long and sordid history when comes to immigration policy--particularly in regard to of "inferior races" that need not discount the notion of race even within the white one.  During World War I, army recruits were given tests that allegedly measured intelligence. These tests were suspect for many reasons even then, since the results suggested a mental age in the top range as 13. That did not stop these tests from influencing public policy, however. The scores of so-called "Alpines" and "Mediterraneans" scores placed them in the main in the "moron" category. Although Italian,  Slavic and Semitic immigrants were largely recent arrivals whose grasp of the English language and American cultural idiosyncrasies was of a lesser quality than native born citizens,  researchers who examined these results chose to champion "innate inferiority" theories in line with their prejudices.     This "innate inferiority" was the principle variable in the backlash against "racially inferior" immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and cutting to a dribble immigration over the next 20 years--that included the years of Holocaust. But there was still the  assumption that "inferior" Mediteraneans (like Tancredo) already here were so mentally incompetent that it was unlikely that they could ever successfully assimilate or contribute anything positive to the body politic. This of course has been proved false by time (although it is difficult to tell if Tancredo is the standard). As we now see, many in this country are even less inclined to give "Mexicans" and "Third World" immigrants the same "benefit" of the doubt.      Illegal immigration should be curtailed, but for Tancredo, like all nativists, the dynamics of cross-border migration in tandem with the need for migratory labor in this country is vastly more complex than he is intellectually (as opposed to politically) capable of discerning. The only thing Tancredo and his conspirators in hate contribute to the discussion is racism and ignorance, as the Southern Poverty Law Center recently revealed.  Tancredo's recently addressed  an outfit called the League of the South, a thinly disguised white supremacist organization; he appeared to be "confused" when serenaded with "Dixie" and surrounded by various Confederate trappings. His utter cluelessness as to the company he was attracting was further demonstrated by his lack of knowledge of the import of the pamphlets he was given later from the Conservative Citizens Council, another defacto white supremacist group.       It is clear that white supremacists have been allowed the "hijack" the debate for their own purposes. Tom Tancredo, for his part, has forgotten the old adage "To forget the past is to repeat it."  
 An 18th century author writing about the dark ages. It reads more like incidents within a narrative rather than a single story.  I found the ending abrupt and not credible. I expected more of the creator of Sherlock Holmes 
 the complaints about this dvd release are all correct. great movie, low qaulity release. yet i'm surprised no one has mentioned the thing that angered me most, the self censorship. the bataan race scene where ustinov swaps the bataan for a bottle of beer. we're ok to witness a pirate being drunk, but a sports commentator saying a teenager is running with a bottle of beer is beyond appropriate?  what are the execs at disney thinking? if they need to put out a disclaimer by leonard maltin befor showing such "questionable" material as they did with many of the vault collection... fine, but stop chopping up the movies. our ten year old children are not buying these movies, many of us were actually alive to see the originals and no we're being ripped off. stop angering a loyal fan base with this ignorance. keep this in mind when you contemplate the inevitable release of a cleaned up widescreen version of this title 
 I watch alot of documentaries and this is by far the worst I have ever seen. I looked forward to watching it being somewhat familiar with Rayful's story but this dvd is just not made very well. This is an hour of reenactments. The story told in this dvd is so one sided. There is so much left I was left wondering why?  There is a quote at the end of the film that is almost comical basically saying the producers did not want to glorify drug dealing. If you do not want to glorify drug dealing try showing all the bad that came out of all the drugs in D.C. at the time.  I read that Kirk Fraser the maker of this film dropped out of film school at Howard University after watching this I think he should have stayed in school. This looks like it was made by a high school kid. 
 I only caught the 2nd half of this movie on tv last night so can't comment on the movie as a whole except to say that I am no fan of ludicrous caper movies.  But I must point out that the scene near the end where Julia Roberts runs up to George Clooney as he's being led away by the cops is totally stolen from the final scene of "Green Card" (Andie McCowell & Gerard Depardieu) and it's not done nearly as well, either.  Don't want anyone to think that got past me 
 I purchsed this kettle about half a year ago and it's already broken. The switch kept turning off automatically before boiling. On top of that the outside is not insulated and i got burned by it 
 It must be a real challenge to make a sex book boring, but Ms. Khalsa has somehow managed.  It's a collection of trite New Age fluff, with such shattering insights as women prefer sex that is emotionally meaningful, combined with little stories about various couples.  I found not much to further explore sex, relationships, or spirituality 
 I had to send this item back because it was to small.  The sizes run small, so beware 
 This gun broke in the first few used.   When I called for service, they inisted on waiting for the tech, and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun  cost.  Overall...  this was a writeoff 
 As an Amazon reviewer, I have dedicated my account to providing a level-headed review of anything that I have listened to that is worth reviewing. More often than not, I will point out the good and the bad for each album as to give to the minds of those who haven't heard it yet unbiased information as to decide for themselves whether or not to purchase it. However, I believe I have actually found an album that has no redeeming value anywhere on it. Chingy never was very talented, whether lyrically or flow-wise, but at least his first album had a couple enjoyable beats that pushed the limit of synthesizer use, helping make some of the song more listenable. But his follow-up is...well, how can I describe while also being nice...unmitigated crap. There, I used a big word in an attempt to be nice. Even if you're into the whole "cash-money-hoes" pop rap that's been overtaking the mainstream, this album won't do a thing for you. Some of these types of rapper at least incorporate some of their young "hood" life experiences to make it their own, but Chingy, other than his nasaly, thick accent, does absolutely nothing to place his trademark on this album. All that this album offers is more generic "I'm rich so I'll flaunt it until you puke" crap. Worse, the beats are unoriginal and do nothing to add to the "music". I don't even know if you can call this music, as it does not follow any of the guidelines that music sets down. Chingy has no talent and no amount of argument is going to prove otherwise. I can't believe I once even listened to this guy. It makes me sick that people like this guy are the ones that get paid millions of dollars and sell multi-platinum records for showing absolutely no sign of musicianship at all. He and all his fellow rappers should be sent back to the hood and be forced to study music theory for the rest of their lives. And for the love of God, Chingy, LEARN TO SPELL! You're not impressing anyone with your unintelligent songs like "Wurr Da Git It Gurlz At" and "Fall'N". I don't see what's so hard about spelling those right. Here's a short lesson: "WHERE ARE THE GET IT GIRLS?" and "FALLING", My god, you can't even spell simple words right.  Bottom line: there is no reason why you should buy this album. Like I said, even if you absolutely adore rap and hip hop in all its forms, you most likely will not find any songs on here worth listening to even once. You'll just find it covered in dust in your closet years from now and retch with disgust that you actually dropped full CD price for such a worthless waste of materials. For rap that actually warrants more than one listen, try Busdriver or Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, who actually have lyrical prowess and interesting flow. For good music in general, listen to great metal bands like Children of Bodom and Blind Guardian, and maybe even some classical composers like Dvorak and Beethoven. Those artists have/had more creative talent in a single atom than Chingy has in his whole body. This CD gets no points whatsoever. I would also give 0 stars to it, but Amazon has not yet realized that 1/5 means that there's at least a shred of quality on it, but this album doesn't even deserve it.  0/1 
 I had been given a slow cooker a while ago, but could never find good recipes for it.  When I thumbed through this book, the pictures and ingredients looked wonderful, so I bought it.  What a mistake!  These recipes could be made much faster and with the same amount of effort if I didn't even use my slow cooker! If I have to cook everything before I put it in the slow cooker, what exactly is the point? I could cook it using my stove and oven in less time with the same results and effort (something I have successfully tried twice). While the recipes are fairly good in general, this was not at all what I was looking for and to me, it has defeated the purpose of using the slow cooker. 
 I read this book because it was frequently mentioned to be (together with the Lord of the Rings) one of the books that are at the root of modern fantasy. In my opinion this book could be placed in other categories as fantasy. It has nothing to do with the sort of novels i consider fantasy. Yes, mister Peake can describe things in an excellent way, and his world does keep some promise. But in this first novel he does very little with it. So i guess i won't read the next (unless i am completly without other interesting books to read). this definitely is not my cup of tea and if you like books written for example by Tolkien, Jordan or Martin, you should get this from the library and try it for free instead of buying 
 This book is great for freshmen or anyone who had never exposed to economics. It's simplicity and clarity makes learning economics fun, yet it doesn't sacrifice any indepth necessary 
 Not sure who this book was intended for.  It is basically a dictionary of sorts, trying to define all sorts of food types and methods.  Two problems come up quickly.  First the definitions are very terse and of little use.  Explaining stock as bones and vegetables cooked together, does little to help the reader gain understanding, and that is one of the better definitions! Secondly, many of the terms are outdated or missing.  I realize how long ago Escoffier lived, but the references to items that changed their names a hundred years ago, makes finding anything very difficult, and usually completely unrewarding 
 I bought this book based on the blurbs, and the fact that I enjoy an occasional Steven Covey - type read.  This sure wasn't one of them.  I started the book once and put it down after reaching the third point, thinking that maybe this wasn't simplistic pap written in an incredibly juvenile fashion, but that maybe for whatever reason my head wasn't into it.  I took it on a recent vacation, thinking that with my mind unfettered, etc., perhaps I might be more open to what the book had to say.  Wrong.  This is a terribly written book, with a hokey, herky-jerky style by an author in need of some creative writing classes, spouting the most basic of tenants as if they are something new.  For Pete's sake, basically this fellow took Zig Ziglar and put in a clever twist of the 'Time Bandits' style confrontations with famous characters. I noted with amusement that all of the characters basically had the same sort of dialogue. When Anne Frank has the same speech patterns as Solomon and Harry Truman, I know I'm reading a really bad book.  Comparing this to Og Mandino is an insult to Og.   This book is to motivational literature what 'Bridges of Madison County' was to fiction 
 I hate to admit I actually own this thing on VHS.  And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut of the movie too.  Double (and more) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of DVD.  We get at least four issues of Terminator 2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  I personally am sick of it.  Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet.  No wonder I've taken to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library.  No, you generally don't get them the day they come out.  But honestly, when was the last time you purchased a movie from Hollyweird that was worth keeping?  Don't do it 
 I will usually read and accept anything, but this book is just so beyond fact for even realistic fiction.  I could have handled this book a lot better if there was no "Frankie".  The character Frankie is just too unbelievable.  I work with "talented and gifted" children that are Frankie's age (8 years old) and not one of them is even remotely this advvanced.  If Frankie was say, 12 or 13 I could accept her maturity, her dedication to her music and so forth, but this is not even believable to anyone who has a child or works with them.  It would be tolerable if Frankie was not the center of the book.  They spend more time about Frankie this and Frakie that, then on the main plot of the book.  This is the 3rd book that I have read or at least tried to read from Iris Johansen and it will be my last.  I just don't like the way she writes or her main characters.  Evertime I buy another one of her books I am always hoping that this will be the one that changes my mind.  Oh well, another book to donate 
  I was really excited to receive the Leisa Hart abs workout from amazon after reading all of the excellent reviews.To my disappointment this ab workout turned out to be terrible! I exercise daily and am getting my degree in physical fitness but I would say that I am intermediate to advanced. When I popped this dvd in my friend and I were ready to get a good abs workout, but neither of us even felt a burn! (My friend is a beginner..) I figured that maybe I was not doing the moves correctly but when I tried it again with an intermediate exercising buddy, we stopped halfway through and put in another dvd. I just don't understand how everyone else on Amazon is posting all of these good reviews! Please don't listen to them if you are used to doing ab workouts- try Shape's "shape your abs" or The firm "jiggle free abs" dvd's instead. By all means, do not waste your money on this one! This dvd is extremely easy, and if you want to lose weight or tone up, you need something more challenging! 
 It explained very brod topics, the author goes on and on about his own experiances. I was just not pleased. Thank yo 
  An extremely convoluted read. Another reader mentioned "dizzying" and I concur. Chock full of psyco-babble and others' personal stories that I found uninspiring.  The numerous exercises Myss requires of you to dissect past emotional events, felt somehow unhealthy and too self-absorbing. How can one be objective about the dynamics of past painful events since our perspective of them can change dramatically with time?      The author's voice was to me that of a least favorite professor in college. You know, the one class you would nod off on occasion? I took alot of effort for me to get through the first lengthy chapter, which I did, indeed, fall asleep around page 83.     However, the bottom line for me was the lack of joy in the authors words. I found Myss overcomplicating, and over intellectualizing too many fundamental Spiritual practicalities and principles. This book would seem better off in "general psychology" and not in the "Self-help/improvement" section of the bookstore. The over-analytical process could be enough to send someone in crisis over the edge.    
 At a risk of offending Joseph Campbell cultists and fantatics, please know that I am both an admirer of Joseph Campbell and James Joyce. It was through Campbell's praise of Joyce's work, that help muster the discipline it takes to read Joyce. I'll give credit where credits due--thanks Joe!  Now here's my beef. I suspect that it's takes a man with a healthy ego and a sense of academic competitiveness to want to incorporate Joyce's work into a grand blanket scheme, such as Joseph Campbell did with many of Joyce's work. I believe Ulysses is appropriate enough to enter into a conversation of mythology, but Finnegans Wake? No, I am not buying it.  So what is this Skeleton's Key anyway? Basically it's a fleshed out version of the Outline of Chapter Contents already provided in the Penguin edition of FW, which in truth, is helpful as a "key". Seamus Deane offers an introduction that is as helpful (and unhelpful) as Campbell's. So over the 70-odd years since Finnegans Wake first appeared and not much is known about it--perhaps Joyce intended just that--an enigmatic mystery. Why try to dismantle a good thing 
 Mr. Morrell's observations are a bit lame, as in "Huh?"  No need to rehash his "lessons of a Lifetime."  He sat down and wrote a book about writing, and he sold some and life goes on.  (One) writers write to feed the ego.  Period.  One dreams of writing when one dreams of feeding the ego.  (Two) Have an ending when you write a story, a letter, or a laundry list.  Ex: Look at all the movies that were begun without endings.  The ending is the pay-off.  (Three)  Don't be boring. If you're bored with your own stuff the reader will be ten times so.  (Four)  Never stop when you're stuck.  You'll regret it. (Five) Don't worry about how many pages or words you write every day.  That's for suckers.  People with little self-esteme fret about such stuff.  Write good and when you stop writing good, stop.  (Six) If you smoke, drink or take drugs when you write your stuff will never-ever be as good if you abstain.  (Seven) If you ask your friends or family to read your stuff they will say they like it--if you get an agent or a publisher to read it they'll say they don't like it, if you get any response at all. (Eight) He has two pages devoted to "how to get an agent" which explains nothing.  You must have a reccomendation from someone the agent trusts before he or she will talk to you.  Mr. Morrell writes like an amature, which doesn't mean, incidently, that such a writer cannot be popular and a best seller.  Maybe his idea was to give advice to writers such as himself.  If so he has succeeded.      
 Better skip the reader's reviews and try another book. This one is far worse than it's rated there. I tried it for what I believed it would entertain me, but it did not 
 Home Lands is an interesting collection of vignettes of Jewish communities and families. But this book is thin in its assertion that a new, strong Judiasm is unfolding across the world. Tye uses very few communities to illustrate his point, and ultimately, the book becomes contrived. Because the stories themselves were not groundbreaking enough or entertaining enough to stand on their own, Tye tries desperately to sew them together with his thesis, which might be interesting if one could believe that a handful of communities represent all the world's Jews. To be frank, this book is dwarfed by a multitude of books on the subject that are backed by much more research 
 The book is super-barbie-girly, both in terms of illustrations and the texts. Every single story reads silly, simplistic, dry and boring. The stories are basically the same familiar old good fairy tales, but somehow the details are altered to make them "morally correct," and, as sideeffects, become very silly girlish.  
 Dr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures.  However, I was appalled by her bias against Western cultural heritage and Christianity.  Her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women.  As a Catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded, compassionate religious sisters, I felt offended by her slur against nuns.  I am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing, but I would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research.  
 It works fine, but my cat won't use it.  I was thrilled with the reviews I read about this fountain and happily set it up as soon as it arrived.  Unfortunately, I like it better than my cat does.  He largely ignores it and still prefers to drink out of the bathtub or a glass.  Oh well.  Before you buy, make sure it's not the sound of the water that attracts your cat. This fountain has no water sound (pretty quite, actually).  I think that's why my cat ignores it 
   I saw this AWFUL excuse for a movie in the theater in the Spring of 1995, and to this day I consider it one of the WORST movies I have ever seen (to date) and an ABSOLUTE waste of the cost of the ticket.     I don't even remember now (it being over a decade later) why I even went to see it.     But I do remember how stupid and boring it was and how I kept dozing off throughout this sorry excuse for a film.      Looking at some of the other reviews I can see that there are others who consider Johnny Mnemonic one of Keanu Reeves's biggest flops.      I like Keanu Reeves, but he should br embarrassed for being part of such a waste of people's money and time!     If I could give this movie NO STARS, or NEGATIVE STARS, I would. But I can't on this site, so I'm giving it 1 star, though it deserves much less!  1 STAR!!!!!! 
 This device was pretty good, the kids loved sleeping with it running.  Then I purchased a Gauss meter and discovered a whopping 400.0mG of EMF radiating from it.  Considering that most countries recommend nothing higher than 1.0mG, and anything over 10.0mG is considered an extreme cancer risk this is completely unacceptable.  The EMF declined rapidly as the range from the device increases, effectively dropping to 0 at 6 feet.  However people that put this on their nightstand should immediately rectify that situation! The fact of the matter is, all electrical devices should always be a minimum of 5 feet away from the body in bedrooms.  Even so, I question the engineering of this device if it emits such a drastic level of EMF.  
 David Duke is, along with William Pierce, the intellectual powerhouse of the neo-Nazi/white supremacy movement.  He has a Ph.D. (in history, no less), and he wrote his dissertation on Zionism and Jewish influence, which, apparently served as one of the foundations for this book.  Duke is also a politician, and even ran for president, which is a terrifying thing to consider, since this book, which promotes his ideas and interpretations of Jews, is little more than a polemic very much like Mein Kampf, only with more sophisticated language and footnotes.  One of the Duke's primary arguments is, of course, that Jews are responsible for just about everything bad.  He links to them to Communism and a whole series of other "subversive" activities and movements, and believes they are waging a war of sorts against the white race, by helping to encourage multiculturalism/multiracialism, and he sets out to prove that Jews were involved with the NAACP, and other civil rights organizations.  As if this is a bad thing.   As for Communism, Duke draws attention to the fact that many Jews have been involved with Communists, like the Rosenbergs, who were executed as Soviet spies in the 1950s.   Marx, of course, had Jewish heritage, though he was an atheist.  Trotsky was Jewish, as well.  As was Julius Martov, the leader of the Mensheviks.  Stalin, however, was not Jewish.  Neither was Molotov, the Soviet foreign minister who helped Stalin purge the foreign ministry of Jews (calling it a kikes' nest).  Molotov had replaced a Jew named Litvinov, who had been replaced so the Soviets could deal with the Nazis.  Many of Stalin's Commissars were not Jewish, nor was Lavrenti Beria, the head of the NKVD, responsible for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of executions.   It seems as if Duke simply wants to deny that Stalin and many of his cohorts were white, and that Stalin came from Georgia, a nation that had historically been staunchly Orthodox Christian.     Stalin, of course, killed and sent many Jews to gulags.   Duke also neglects to explore the reasons why Jews might have found Communism/Bolshevism appealing.  Tsarist Russia was virulently anti-Semitic, with Jews being blamed for economic problems (though they, like so many other Russians were victims of horrible repression during centuries of tsarist rule), and also being subjected to persecution consistently throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  If Communism promised to change the current system of government, why would Jews not find it appealing?  Of course, there were many Jews who fled the Soviet Union and never did like Communism, but it was better for them to stay in Russia than to fall into German hands.  Jews in Poland and western Ukraine welcomed the Soviets when they invaded in 1939, because of continual anti-Semitism in those regions.   Duke obviously espouses white supremacy and survivalism; Zionism is really nothing more than Jewish variations of these things, and yet he condemns it, and claims it poses a threat to the white/European/Christian race.    His comments on the Talmud, and the passages he chooses to quote from the Talmud are occasionally taken out of context.  One passage frequently cited by anti-Semites seems to suggest that it is okay to have sex with girls as young as three, but the real meaning of this passage is much different.    The Talmud is not the main holy book of Judaism.   The Torah is. The Talmud, as I understand it, is a book of rabbinical commentary and wisdom. If Duke and other Christians want to lay claim to the Old Testament, which is full of verses talking about mass murder of people with different beliefs, then it is awfully hypocritical of Duke to talk of how the Talmud encourages the murdering of gentiles (or goyim).  I will not even begin to address his thoughts on the Holocaust, many of which should not be surprising, considering the audience this is written for.  Duke's doctoral degree is in history, and he should know better.  There is so much evidence verifying the actuality of the Holocaust, that those who continue to deny it are simply ignoring things they know will forever tarnish the reputation and image of their precious Third Reich and their wonderful Fuhrer.  Some may find this book to be full of nothing but absolute truth, but, for the rational reader, many of Duke's claims are crazy and pathetic, as he more or less condemns an entire group of people, by linking ALL of them to things like Communism and Zionism.  It is akin to portraying all Catholics as alcoholics or child molestors, which, of course, is absurd.  
 We could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients.  We also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker, but couldn't get it to work.  Must be the rising temparature is not appropriate 
 What exactly is positive about the Koran and its view of women?  Every single assertion of this polemic is either a complete fabrication or wrong.  The Hadiths and Sunna are not the chauvinistic part 'corrupting' the Koran, if anything the opposite is true.  In Surah 4:34 the Koran orders the Husband to beat his wife.  In numerous Suras the husband is ordered to pay the equivalent of a dowry to his wife, not her family however.  The entire Koranic book of 'women' is simply one law after another about 'them' which is to say the women.  The reason it is talking about 'them' when referring to women and 'us' when speaking about men is because the Koran is meant for men.  There is not one equality in the entire Koran dealing with women and men.  Men may take four wives women, women presumably one husband.  Men may have slaves and men may marry and do as they please sexually with the slaves.  No similar injunction applies for women.  Men receive virgins and wine and service in heaven...the situation of women in heaven is left to the imagination, although presumably they make up the virgins.    The Koran details a world of only men where women are not only chattel but are the sexual objects of the society, sold as slaves and used and then divorced at the mans pleasure.  There is not one equality.  Scholars have argued that Koran reformed women's rights and elevated their status because in pre-Islamic Arabia women had NO rights and under Koran they are entitled to at least a dowry and a man may not take endless numbers of wives.  This doesn't translate as equality, it translates as a male centered world, where men are masters and women are virtually property.   The fact that god in Koran is not referred to as 'father' does not indicate a feminist view of god but merely reflects the very monotheistic nature of Islam, certainly a valid fact that differentiates it from Christianity.  However once again this is not evidence of women's rights, because the non-gender view of god doesn't change the very negative view of women's role on earth given in the Koran.  If someone is going to read this they should certainly have handy an unbiased translation of the Koran so they can reflect on all the laws regarding women and why those same laws do not apply equally to men, for instance one  might wonder why a wife may not beat her disobeying husband? Or why the husband is not commanded to be modest?    Seth J. Frantzman    
 I second the reviews below.  This is a 5-star movie, but the quality of this transfer is horrible.  Parts of the movie are very scratchy and full of film debris.  Worst yet, to me, are the subtitles.  They are laughable.  Almost every subtitle contained some error.  While it was (sorta) fun to laugh and the odd subtitles, that tended to remove me emotionally from the film.  Too bad.  The same comments apply to the "Raise the Red Lantern" release from this same company 
 I agree with June 26 review....except I am going to say it better...her instruction---SUCKS!  Most irritating is the fact that she yells!...I don't find that particuliarly motivating.  In fact--"I FIND IT QUITE DISTRACTING" (Can you hear me now!!?)  And the moving all over the 'friggin' place as she is lifting---is also DISTRACTING and nerve racking to say the least.  I was never a fan of hers anyway but I needed a routine (and still do now) for a free weights program.    This...definitely (4 me that is...) isn't it.  If I didn't mind paying shipping and handling again...I send it back to the seller (bless his/her ole' heart...they got it to me sooo fast)...with no expectation of a refund.    That's right...they could have this s%$!& back fuh' free!!!  
 De Soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights: it's incredibly difficult for poor people (specifically, recent urban migrants) to get legal title to their land. As a result, the poor make "extralegal" arrangements, squatting on and using land that neighbors (but not the government) recognize as theirs. But because they don't own the land, they can't get a mortgage on their house to start a business, electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services, the government has difficulty taxing them because they don't have a legal address, and so on. And so on.  It's a very important point but de Soto oversells, arguing with exaggerated (and oft-repeated) ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor.   He occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work. For example, he has helped businesses in Peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal, and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes: a useful bit of empirical information, but those gems appear all too occasionally.  Before reading this entire book, I recommend going to the website of de Soto's foundation (the Institute for Liberty and Democracy at www.ild.org.pe) and reading the main point there (in one tenth the words) 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 Bottom line: better get Stein's other book.   This one is long on personal stories and short on advice.  Do we really need to hear all about Stein's experience with Jimmy Hoffa just to learn that a book written in voice is more lively than one written in impersonal prose?  Anyone who has reached the level that they are considering reading this book probably knows that already.  In any case, what is needed is HOW to write in a voice, not the vanilla advice to do so.   Of course, if you have plenty of money and plenty of time, there are probably a few tidbits in this book that may be new to you.  And if you are a beginner, you'll of course benefit from hearing the ABCs expounded by this confident pro 
 This, I'm sure is a great book, just not for me 
 I think I've seen almost everything Bob's been involved with and this just didn't do it for me. If you have friends and they aren't complete dullards, you've probably had most of the conversations you'll see in this movie 
 This book deals exclusively with the business side of stand-up.  It tells you what you need and what is important but only gives simple suggestions on how to achieve it.  Also there is advice from comedieans at the end but none of the comedieans are headliners or big.  Overall, this book is not for stand-up tips but basically a listing of what is needed to succeed in the business 
 I've been a fan of Clancy's Jack Ryan series for a while. Patriot Games, The Hunt for Red October, and the Cardinal of the Kremlin were all excellent thrillers. The Bear and the Dragon, however, is just terrible. I liked reading Clancy books for the international intrigue and military action. I don't need to hear him opine about the flat tax, abortion, and the Lewinsky scandal on every other page. Nor do I need to hear him refer to the Chinese as "chinks" or "little slant eyed bastards." We get it - they're the bad guys in the book. There's no need to use racial slurs to get your point across. I reliably bought every Clancy book that came out up until this one. After reading The Bear and the Dragon, I'm never buying one again. 
 I personally cannot believe that a few of the artists in this book gave their o.k. to the author of this book. Most of the tattooers have no business trying to teach anything. I believe that if I were going to do this type of book, I'd take a little more time to get with better artists doing cooler tattoos. Even the Capo piece is lacking....it looks like he gave up on the clothes after spending too much time on the face. All in all, if you are a basement tattooer with no prior knowledge, you'll probably learn enough to really scar someone....if you're a professional tattooer with $17 to buy the book, then you probably already tattoo at least as well as anyone in the book. Its worth a read just for a laugh! 
 This is a great concept for a three book series, but after this first book, I felt unsatisfied with the character development and predictable plot. Mariah Stewart did a great job of writing, though the book wasn't that suspenseful (maybe I've just been reading too much lately).  The relationship between Mara Douglas and Aiden Shields wasn't fully developed. I would have liked a few more scenes where they get to know each other, or something just to show the chemistry between the two. I found that seriously lacking in this book. If you want an easy read, get a used copy of this book, but definitely don't pay full price. I'm not going to bother with the other two in the series. This one didn't make me care enough to finish the series 
 Good book giving the details on all the CS 2's new features. Two thumbs up 
 Don't bother watching this dark, depressing movie unless you are too happy and need something to bring you down quickly. The story is far-fetched, there are few likeable characters, and no, I didn't really need to see the great William H. Macy in bedroom scenes -- yes, that's scenes - not a scene. Alec Baldwin got a best supporting actor nomination for a very forgettable role in my opinion. I expected more 
 Nothing original here.  Nothing overly humourous.  Overall pretty bland in my opinion.  The only part I thought was really worth watching was when the casket exploded at the end.  
 If I can't buy the cd with ALL THE SONGS that were played in the movie then I won't buy it. I know one cd could cover the entire movie so why can't this be done? Does it concern copy rights and releases 
 I purchsed a package of these because the supermarket was out of my regular diapers and my baby is only two months and we've been trying different diapers. I was instantly disgusted by the scent when I opened the package; the diapers are scented and it doesn't say so on the package. I would never have bought them if I'd known that.  The worked fine for leaks and those related worries, but every time I put one on her I was irritated. I want to smell my baby, pooh incidend or not, when I pick her up. I don't want to smell the flowery perfume a corporation has added to their diapers. Shes my child, she smells, its ok 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 Well, you won't learn anything historical from this movie but it is entertaining Hollywood fare. The reason the Mormons were run out of nearly every town was not because they were "just Mormons" but because they made themselves a law unto themselves and did everything from counterfeit money to luring young, underaged girls into polygamous marriages (and a lifetime of slavery), to building up vast arsenals of weapons, and threatening everyone who disagreed with them (they later murdered a large number of people in the Mountain Meadows Massacre). Brigham Young ran Salt Lake City like a slave state and public whippings and jihad type murders were common. BTW, the film never mentions that Joseph Smith wanted his son to be the next president of the church, not Young. The real story of Salt Lake is a gruesome story of religious fanaticism (to exclude outsiders, the church even tried to invent its own alphabet - the Deseret alphabet), blood and violence, and undemocratic autocracy/theocracy. If you are looking for Tyrone Power, his appearance here is brief 
 This is easily one of the worst written, worst researched, and worst argued books I have ever read.  In fact it is so bad it is laughable.  I do not agree with their views but this has nothing to do with this review.  Turn to the epilogue and read this statement: "For example, all prophecy scholars agree that the generation that saw Israel restored to her land in 1948 could well be the "generation [that] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened" (Matthew 24:32-34, NIV)."  No one, not even LaHaye can actually believe that statement.  You can't get 10 people to agree on what to have for lunch, how in the world will you ever get people to agree on something as controversial as the interpretation of Bible prophecy.  Other things that had me in stitches was when they said that a past scholar believed there would be 50 years between the rapture and the tribulation.  They then go on to state that they are pretty sure he would change his mind if he were alive today.  That may be true but why even bring it up.  If that makes it in your book you surely must not have much to say.  Don't waste your time, money, or effort on this book.  I had never read any Left Behind or other LaHaye prophecy books.  From the outside in it sure seemed like it was a cash cow with little substance.  This absolutely proved to me that my assumption is probably true.  ****A Side Note**** For those commenting on reviews by partial preterists, you really have no idea what you are talking about.  I understand the futurist view.  I was taught it my whole life and in Bible college.  I have read books about it including this piece of drivel.  The least you can do is read something by DeMar or Gentry and learn what you are arguing against instead of making assumptions.  What has been written so far in the reviews really makes you look like you have no idea what you are talking about 
 After reading this book from cover to cover and following all the suggestions, I went to a personal injury attorney and found out that this book is "generic" and doesn't apply to all cases, everywhere.  All the time I put into it and none of it applied to me 
 This book is outdated for the 21st century. The basics are there and in great detail but most of the information is useless for today 
 If this movie was ever going to have a chance, it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long, or never attempted in the first place. Some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - Possession just can't be dealt with that way. What you have as a result is another story entirely. There just wasn't time enough, I guess, to develop the characters, or even to include half of them. The only character true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming. My best advice is that if you've read the book, skip the movie, but if you saw the movie, you should do yourself a favor and get the book 
 The jacket is cut undersized, typical of foreign makes with poor quality control. The lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity. Exterior shell has nice feel, but overall, a poor piece of work 
 A waste of valuable bookshelf space. This is a simple minded overview of ham radio operation; there isn't enough content to hold attention for long.  A typical chapter title is "Electricity, An Invisible Superhero."  Give us a break. Much better are the titles available at American Radio  Relay League (check their website) 
 I'm not exactly sure how to classify this, nor do I think it really deserves the time.  How this album has garnered so many positive reviews is beyond me.  My only guess is that some tired, pretentious teen on MySpace raved over it and voila, the clique was born.    Now, I really wanted to like this and gave it numerous listens.  But each time, it sounds more and more like these guys were just doing some busy work around the house, started humming some melodies and then recorded them.  Immature and pretty much unoriginal.  And just because an album is labeled "concept" doesn't automatically qualify it as a masterpiece.  If you want a flawless concept album that actually has an interesting story just go and buy "The Wall".  Unless your circle of friends has threatened to emascualte you for not owning this, don't bother with this bloat.  
 Having first seen the movie, I was prepared that this was not a starry-eyed wholesale endorsement of high school football, but I was still thrilled when my wife surprised me with a copy to read.  I have never been so dissapointed with a book on football, or all of sports for that matter. I enjoyed Next Man Up and A Civil War, due to Feinstein's balance between negative and positive lights on the game. Bissinger, in Friday Night Lights, shows no such balance. He does not "follow the season" in any logical fashion, sometimes skipping entire games, and spends a chapter instead focusing on national politics. Honestly, you'll see the name of Michael Dukakis more than you will the name of Permian's starting quarterback.  I love football, I love high school athletics, and found this book to be very annoying. Check it out in a library before you spend your dollars on it 
 The setting-sometime in the near future.  The premise-a family man who is making a space repisintation of the box, only to find out that an ancestor of his made the original box that unleased the hell demons that we know so well.  Give it a break, the future and evil demons have been done before. Give it a rest.   A poorly thought and unoriginal movie about a man who is trying to close the gates to hell.  This sound familiar?  If it doesn't don't even consider watching this horrible movie 
 Confuses Calvinistic moral posturing with honesty. Extremely poorly researched or evidence that didn't match cherished beliefs of the target market was omitted in order to increase sales to that niche 
 I find it rather humorous that Mr. Bossidy would write a book with this title.    It was Mr. Bossidy's decision to hire Ray Gimlartin as Chairman of Merck, a decision which most analysts seriously questioned.  The disastrous outcomes of that decision are still being played out.    It took years for Mr. Bossidy to confront reality and do the right thing by finally acknowledging his mistake and replacing Gilmartin.  Even then, as the company was sinking fast, he kept Gilmartin in an advisory capacity with a salary most people can only dream of.  Now he intends to share with others his wisdom regarding "confronting reality"???  If anything, Mr. Bossidy's latest work is a classic case of "do as I say, not as I do" 
 Already wary of John Vornholt's writing, I was hoping this would change my mind...I was wrong. There is little or no action until the very end, and I was hoping it would be epic space battles, which I got from the cover.    But the Enterprise is stuck in a starbase, and all the crew does is try to  help some pathetic commander. And when they do finally show up, it's too  obvious, and it was like an after-thought to add the rest of the crew in  the story.   The only two characters who really shined were Hasmek and  Geordi, since they weren't used that much, and Vornholt couldn't screw them  up.   The whole Badlands part is pointless.    I suggest to anybody that  you read the Deep Space Nine series, because they're awesome in comparison.    A war fits nicely into the Deep Space Nine universe, not The Next  Generation universe 
 Okay,  This is not a review of the product itself. But, I strongly encourage you to consider not getting an N.E.W warranty. They are really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things.   If you had anything to do with the device not working (e.g. you dropped it, forget about it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever.)   They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginia(of course you have to pay for the shipping!)  Lastly, they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N.E.W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N.E.W will take months to pay them for the work they did.  If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it 
 This book will be most humorous for those raised with strong Catholic values and have since fallen away or at the very least pick and choose what they want to believe is moral.  The reality, however, is that you will find the greatest sexual fulfillment within the sacrament of marriage, if you choose to follow church teachings.  If you don't believe this then I'm sad to say that joke is truly on you.  This is being said from the perspective of a 26 year old male 
 Wow. I was shocked. Legitimate statements of liberal Christianity include ones like, 'Transubstantiation is mistaken', 'The Vatican does not have a direct pipeline to God', 'Homosexuality is not a sin', 'Condoms and birth control are morally defensible', NOT 'Jesus never performed miracles', 'The trinity does not exist', 'Jesus is not the Son of God.' It is disingenuous for Spong to assert he is a Christian when he disavows ALL the major tenets of the religion - virgin birth, miracles, incarnation, atonement, resurrection, ascension, the trinity, and the deity of Jesus. He believes less in a religion per se and more in a code of ethical conduct like, say, Confucianism, and the "patronizing nonsense" (a la C.S. Lewis) that Jesus was simply a great moral teacher. He even says on page 229, "...a religionless Christianity must be born." Religionless Christianty?! That's a contradiction in terms. Mr. Spong sounds like an ethicist, not a religionist. He also owes Saint Paul an apology for rumor-mongering when the man has long been absent and not around to defend himself.  I do admit though, I liked a lot his discourse on the plight of women and mens' subconscious fear of them. I also liked his observations on homosexuality. What he had to say about Judas was also interesting (but misleading as it is based solely on his own suppositions, not evidence). The section on anti-semitism was informative but that whole subject has always struck me as odd to begin with, i.e., that a Christian could hate or resent a Jew. Very odd.  I'm sure we've all noticed that bible-interpetation discussions are on the same road as capital punishment, birth control, gun control, and abortion: I'm Right and You're Wrong Avenue. Especially with bible interpretation, words and phraseology are open to diverse translations, and theologians themselves disagree.  Oh, and here's my two cents on the Council of Nicea. Of course the Christian theologians had to discuss Christian doctrine and record it for posterity. Of course Christianity had to be, dare I say, 'corporatized' in a way. How can the Word spread without an efficient distribution channel? The remarkable thing is that it did not happen much sooner. You see now, though, how it is very easy for anyone with an advanced intellect (such as Spong) to take the very (true) words I have just said in this paragraph and make it sound convincingly like, "You see!..he admits it..corporatized!..distribution channels!..surely there was wheeling and dealing...these people were not serious...blah blah blah."  I offer one piece of advice. However, I admit I base this advice on my belief that: 1) An all-loving God exists, 2) the gospels are historically accurate, 3) Jesus is the incarnated Son of God and 4) the bible is divinely inspired. Whenever a bible passage irks you, enrages you, or just generally creates any type of irritation in you, remember that YOU are the one thinking about it. And you're not God.    
 I read for some time waiting for it to be interesting.  No such luck 
 I had never read a Danielle Steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. I was pretty disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, I would still like it. I think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. Yes, I get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! In addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, "so and so was a devoted mother" and repeating this fact again and again and again. These flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. This book did not leave me wanting to read more of Ms. Steel's books. It is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading. 
 Don't waste your time. Not only does he involve one of the singers from Air Supply in his "research," but he mangles biblical historicity and concludes that the Ark must be a geoplasmic transmitter... Looney tunes. I'm embarrassed to say that I've read it.  Now, if you really want a good read about the Ark with much better conclusions, research and evidence, then check out Graham Hancock's The Sign and the Seal or Robert Cornuke's Relic Quest. Hancock's book is from a secularist perspective while Cornuke's is from a Christian. However, both arrive at some startling evidences and conclusions 
 I am utterly disappointed in the direction that Gamepro has taken over the past two years. I actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year, but came back to the 20 issues for $10 at their (10?) year anniversary.  I forget.  But the magazine is really bad.  One thing I laugh is, the retro corner.  They have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before, and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago. I think the most recent issue, they said: 140 pages?  Huh?  I think my last issue was around 100.  And don't try to tell me they've lost 40 pages in advertising.   Too bad on-line reviews and websites, are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines. I'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life. Or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low, I can't stand it anymore.  Or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort.   You guys were pretty good 5 years ago, but you've gone to pot these past two years!  I'm talkin' to you Watchdawg!!!  You guys are suckin' lately!!!  MC White said:  You guys are suckin'!! 
 Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book 
 This book was boring. I could not finish it I only read about 25 pages and gave up.  I have read other books by Christopher that were very good but this one just about put me to sleep. I hope Barbra writes her own story real soon I would love to read it. 
 I am a vegetarian and my husband was suckered by this title because of my love for vegetables.  This book should be called vegetable LIKE--as a side dish.  First, she misses no opportunity to pimp meat/fish/fowl in this vegetable cookbook.  Second, it's not very good.  For a definitive and creative work, see The Passionate Vegetarian.  Or the Italian Vegetarian.  Lots of better books.    I relented and gave it one star because maybe it will cause some people to wake up and eat vegetables 
 There's a lot to like in this book, theoretically. The worlds themselves are well-drawn, the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty (that sort of mimics but doesn't really ever come close to the best that William Gibson has given us). The science is seamlessly integrated into the story, and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure.  The theory doesn't hold, though. This just isn't a very good book.   The action follows three different characters, along three different threads. At first, and for most of the book, they have no obvious connection with each other. Their stories appear to unravel aimlessly, and although lots of stuff happens, none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story. It has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations, physical or moral.  There is a payoff, but it takes a long time to get there, and by the time I did I was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it didn't really have much of an impact.  There are three major problems with this book:  Information withholding: I like books with central mysteries, that make you wait (and work) to understand what's going on. It's a good propulsive technique, plot-wise. But the mysteries need to resolve. The author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through, dropping occasional hints that aren't so much tantalizing as frustrating. As I said: by the time I figured out what was going on, I'd stopped caring. This might just be my limitations as a reader, but I gather, from other reviews, that a lot of people feel the same way. You work so hard to understand what's going on that it's difficult to enjoy any of it.  Dreams: Harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot: to elucidate the characters' psychology, and to give us a window into their past. This is unfortunate, because (in my mind) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition, instead of wending it into the story. Generally speaking, as soon as I hit a dream sequence, I lose interest. I lost interest a lot in this book. Which is a shame, because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful, strange and sometimes even touching. It just needs to be presented better.  Unremitting dourness: There is nothing pleasant about reading this book. The main characters are either savage and unlikeable, pitiable and unlikeable, or mystifying and unlikeable. Often all three. And, with the exception of the wife (who I liked almost as much as I pitied), none of the supporting characters are much use either. The worlds they inhabit are brutal, dire, unpleasant, and dour. There's a lot of sex here, but as portrayed it's mostly just another kind of violence. The whole thing's kind of a downer, pretty much the whole way through, and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing, as if it's been grafted on from another, happier book.  The writing itself has some odd lapses too, given the care that went into the structure of the book, and the obvious attention to detail. Lots of tortured, passive sentences. A few bits of dialogue that sound like campy Chandler.   Harrison is obviously very talented. I wanted very much to like this book, and I suspect I'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future. There's a great deal of potential here. It's just that most of it went unrealized 
 Bad Bad Bad WORST VILLAN WORST PLOT WORST ACTORS WORST SONG NOTHING WAS GOOD ABOUT IT!!! 
 I was going to write a review of this book but the review by "MJS Book Addict" ("Pop history with a few bizarre detours")said it all extremely well. Don't waste your time with this volume. Read Will Durant for a much more satisfying and less "preachy" and quirky discourse. I was going to pass this volume on to our library but threw it away instead 
 if you don't believe try doing the exercise on page 316, you won't get past step 4. It's like they left out a few steps to the exercise 
 I'm not sure what the young lady is trying to accomplish here...potentially compelling folk-blues material collapses under the weight of annoying , exaggerated Appalachian vocal affectations ("Give me that ol'-fashion mor-phyne...it's good enough for mae"). Guess I should have taken heed from her similarly afflicted turns on the Be Good Tanyas' Blue Horse ("Riiine and snow..."). As a counterpoint I contrast her with Gillian Welch, who manages to stay on the good side of the line separating authenticity from irony. It's a shame, thinking about what might have been if she would drop the pretensions and just...sing 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 A book on a truly fascinating topic, plagued by sloppy copy editing and proof reading, and enough errors to make it annoying to any reader who knows how to use grammer, grommar, or whatever they call that. How disappointing 
 What's with all the titles using the word Fantastic?  Wow, that's so original!  Did you write that yourself?  Anyway, I was disappointed with this one, like many others here.  I thought it was a big waste of time and talent.  I would have liked to have more of a plot-line set up, and some type of comarardarie between the Fantastic Four.    But this slack was garbage.    I would not rent or purchase this movie.  MC White said:  Not F.... darn it, I almost did the same thing 
 I found this book virtually useless.  Included numerous statistical informaion, without much useful advise or guidance 
 This book costs a lot, but if you devide the $ by the total number of words, it could be more expensive than GOLD!!    Although it got 264 pages, however each page only has less than 20 lines, if there is no picture on it.  Each line only has 12 words.  Have you ever read a "big print" book?  The print of this book is more than BIG.  There is no need for reading glasses, for sure.  If you expect to learn anything about repair a mechanical watch from this book, you will be totally disappointed.  It is why that the title of book got "Simplified" as a qualifier.    It is over simpmlified, in my view.  Out of total pages, one third of them (about 93 pages) are for Glossary, which you can find on many of the watch web sites.  What a rip-off!!   Don't buy!  
 The best thing about this book for me was that it was so short.  I really don't think I could have finished if it were any longer.  I just don't get it.  I found the book to be so simple that it was insulting.  I felt like I should have read this at about 10 years of age.  Profound? Hardly. Masterpiece? Certainly not.  The only impact that this book had on me was trying to figure out what all the fuss was about... and I am still working on that one 
 I cannot understand why the fuss over this book. The text is disappointing: repetitive, opinionated, insubstantial, more like desultory notes than anything else. The images are all black-and-white and poorly reproduced, and again repetitive and disconnected.  There is too much horror in it. Bataille associates violence, horror, terror, pain, cruelty, with eroticism, madness, ecstasy, the sacred. Perhaps intense cultivation of pleasure creates a corresponding accumulative cultivation of pain. Why should this be so? I don't know except that we have what it takes to explore and we can explore in all and any direction. It's as simple as that.  It's possible to write books and essays that are lucid and meaningful and it's possible to write "The Tears of Eros" 
 I like to check out the reviews on books before I buy since there is no way to actually thumb through the book and see for yourself if it is what you want.  Most of the time this has done fine for me and I have enjoyed what I purchased.  Not this time.  For the life of me I can't figure out why anyone would give this book any more than 1-2 stars...5 stars is just absurd!!!  Looking through the pages of this book all I could think of was, "you've got to be kidding me!"  So there goes another [amount of money]out the window.  I guess if you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about hairbraiding and you can't find a friend to show you the BASICS then you might find something here.  I mean they "teach" you how to create a PONYTAIL...is there anyone on the planet that doesn't know how to do a ponytail?  Honestly?  I was looking for a book that would offer some variety.  I have two small daughters one starting school next year and I wanted to be able to do somthing with their hair other than a pony tail, pig tails, or a basic french braid.  So, I bought this book on Braids...what a mistake.  I will go to the book store next time so that I can look through the pages!  I wanted to give this book 1 star, but I changed my mind due to the fact that there are a couple pages on how to make scrunchies and barretts and the end of the book.  So one star for basic french braiding for someone who is an absolute beginner and one star for the barretts section.  Again, this was not something I was interested in, and also something I think most people can figure out fairly easily on their own, but none the less I decided to give this book 2 stars...which is being VERY, VERY generous on my part!  If you are looking for a book to give you some ideas on styling hair I highly suggest you look elsewhere.  Happy book hunting - I hope this helps someone out there 
 Character studies of dysfunctional families is a fairly common comedy device.  However, in most such efforts, there are enough likable traits to counterbalance the unlikeable ones.  We found no redeeming qualities in any of the major characters.  Even the bride (who is supposed to carry the film) seemed fake and unlikeable.  We watched about 20 minutes of this DVD and ditched it in favor of something else.  For a much better "quirky family" movie, wait for "The Family Stone" to come out on DVD 
 i picked this book up in preparation for my stay in germany with a friend, whose mother does not speak english. maybe it was because i have some prior knowledge of basic german, but the first several chapters of this book were almost useless. when i showed my german friend the book and cds, he said 'no one talks like this. if you speak like this people will just laugh at you'. i decided to purchase this from my experience with teach yourself norwegian and swedish, which so far has been very pleasant and helpful 
 You know a book is going to be mind numbing when the author praises their book above all others for about 4 pages.  I understand that this is a college level book but it didn't need to use so much jargon.  The paragraphs are almost impossible to decipher on the first, second, or even third read.  The author obviously had to use ambigious language to make himself seem more academic. When explaining the works of Goya they devote an entire chapter to him.  Pages upon pages which in reality could have been truncated down to perhaps 3 or 4. The pictures are on one page and the explanation of the pictures can be PAGES away.  Making studying extremely difficult.  My classmates and I believe that the true answers are in some other book, or perhaps you need a black light to find them.  This book is like punishment from God 
 Based on the reviews of this book I decided to buy it! To my absolute shock, I dont understand who wrote these great reviews??? They were probably written by the publisher or author of this book. What a waste of time and money. Being a designer myself, i ve got every possible book on interior design, and furniture styles that are out on the market. Based on the price of this book, and good reveiws, I figured it would be a great addition to my collection of books and references. Its poorly printed, very bad paper quality, no detailed shots of the furniture pieces, and not worth the price whatsoever. I mean if the publisher is charging this price, then the least they could do is print it on good paper and have clearer pictures. I am extremely dissapointed and returning the book asap. If u enjoy throwing your money away on a small book with poorly printed pictures(aside from the info, which is fine)then this is the book to buy . But if you are looking for details of furniture, including the background and history, and worth every penny, then i suggest you buy (Furniture: World Styles From Classical to Contemporary by Judith Miller  
 My Space Bags came in yesterday.  I couldn't wait to try them.  The first one amazed me with how flat it became.  However, the next two I tried doing both ripped!!!!!  Then this morning the one that worked last night has puffed back up.  I am extremely disappointed!!!! 
 First, to debunk the product description, the most terrifying "Jaws" ever will always be the first. Nothing after that is even in the same league. And this chapter continues the devolution that started after the ending credits of the original, topped only by "Jaws 4- The Revenge," in being worse. "III was originally released at the theater  in 3-D, which didn't improve it by any stretch, rather made it more of a novelty. In viewing in non-3D release, it's even worse because you can see how the director catered to the 3-D scenes, which are obvious when you watch it now. The acting couldn't be more "made for TV," as can be said about the whole storyline, the scenes and the deception freely utilized by the camera and director. This is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself scoffing, "Yeah, right!", when seeing many of the sequences. Even the very ending of the movie caused us to laugh with contempt when exiting the theater. Once again, another movie, regardless of how bad it is, I peak at it occasionally when on the Dish just to watch Lea Thompson, even though her acting in this one is nothing for the time capsules. The same can be said of the whole cast in fact, including, shamefully, Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar winning "Officer and a Gentleman" role. He couldn't have a more annoying, over the top, archetypical character. I hope the check was worth it Louis. There's nothing nearly as suspenseful, dramatic, or engaging as the original. There are no characters that you really care about- there's no depth, merely posturing by the characters. And the climax' plausibility is an insult to one's intelligence. This movie is just plain bad. In that it can be worth a watch alone, just to take pot shots at the absurdity of it all and to see how far down making a buck had dragged down the once proud brand name of "Jaws. 
 This book is a tormented stream of consciousness from a lady who was obviously fighting major demons.  It is exactly the type of book that you would expect an amateur academic to "wow" and "gush" over, as it nicely fits into the dogmatic radicalism of Chicano Studies.  The discerning reader, on the other hand, sees page after page of outdated cliches, sob-stories, and anger-filled tantrums.  Anzaldua would like you to believe her suffering and self-searching  is all the fault of the "white" culture encroaching upon the enlightened cosmic race of the mestiza.  She'd like you to think that her mestiza/chicana/lesbian/female identity is the sole cause of her misfortune and hardship.   What becomes overwhelmingly evident upon reading her unabashed torrent of decadent self-pity is the learned and self-enforced quality of her "opression".   Anzaldua helplessly wallows in her romantic fatalism dreaming of the great mestiza revolution that will fix all of the world's problems by turning the middle class value system upside down.  If you like romantic literature, and enjoy the hopeless and sorrowful ramblings of society's self-marginalized, I might suggest "The Sorrows of the Young Werther" by Goethe or some poems by Lord Byron - at least then you get some literary value 
 I started reading the book as a part of my personal development with the company that I work for. The book is founded in behaviorism, and does not stray from the concepts associated with this worldview. My issue with it is that I believe that people are more than a reaction to the things that happen to us. We have unique personalities, and they consist of more than the conditioning that they are subjected to. This psychology takes away the idea of free-will and choice, and eliminates personal responsibility. When it comes to managing people, I believe that these are important elements to tap into. This behaviorist approach to management may look good on the surface, and make logical sense, but is flawed by its nature, and cannot have any long lasting impact 
 Even though this book contains an abundance of TRIZ material, the literal translation of by Williams prevents even the most tenacious reader from capturing very much knowledge. It was a serious work by Altshuller, unfortunately novices to this methodology will have to extract information from this book one piece at a time. If first time readers of TRIZ material would like a good beginners book to start with let me recommend "And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared". This book is easy reading and illustrates many TRIZ principles. First time readers should stay at the shallow end of the pool and when they become more proficient go into the deep water with Ceativity as an Exact Science 
 The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations 
 Save your valuable time and steer clear of this train wreck!  Worse yet, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life if you make an important decision based on Retirement Places Rated. Sorry, but I get upset after having my time and money wasted, and just need to vent. I've spent a career in corporate relocation, and find myself stunned at most of the recommendations.  The book's choices usually fall into the following categories; unaffordable, uninteresting, uninhabitable, unsafe, unpleasant, unhealthy, or uncomfortable. On top of the flawed and biased reviews that might have been researched from chamber of commerce web sites, the book's layout requres endless page flipping to get the full profile of each city. And yes, I said biased.  As a West Coaster, where are the cities west of the Rockies?  There are very few included, representing a strong East Coast leaning, maybe because the author sticks to what he can drive to. Please, Mr. Savageau, invest in a Jet Blue ticket and take a trip out here.  Spend some time out here, in person, and maybe you'll avoid mistakes like your #1 choice - Florence, Oregon. I asked an associate from the Northwest about this town as the nation's top retirement spot, and she laughed, "Retire there?  I don't even like to drive through Florence!  Has this guy ever been there?" Good question!  
 . .If you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets, you'd have a great case against these two! This book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new. In fact, it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the "experiment", providing only bits and pieces along the way. It actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details, and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case. A don't know much about William L. Moore, but I used to read all Charles Berlitz's books when I was a kid, as I thought the Bermuda Triangle made for some great stories. But as I got older, I realized that that's all they were. Charles Berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while "researching" his Bermuda Triangle books, just rehashed old sailor's tales. I recall him during a guest spot on the "Larry King Live" program, and when I Coast Guard officer called in and provided known, verifiable details on some of his "without a trace" cases, Berlitz looked like a monkey. As a former Coast Guard Rescue Pilot myself, stationed for 3 years in Borinquen, Puerto Rico (one of the apexes of the "Triangle"), I can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to "disappear without a trace", and that there is nothing mysterious about it. . .it's a big ocean! I witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena, all of which had perfectly good explanations. Save yourself some money and avoid all books that have Charles Berlitz's name associated with them unless you're reading them for "entertainment purposes only" 
 Early on (p.137 is a good example) Lawlor clearly unveils his "extreme Green" biases.  Obviously, he'd like several BILLION human beings to just evaporate (and take their cultural artifacts with them, thank you very much) so that his "dream of regeneration" could come to pass ... with Humanity reverting to "spiritually connected" neo-stone-age hunter-gatherer bands.  It's hard to take an anthropological essay seriously if the author repeatedly throws Luddite tantrums, which are a notable "feature" of this book 
 From the favorable reviews, I assumed that this would be an informative book.  However, this is not the case.  I learned very little in the course of reading the book, and here is why:  The laws are obvious.  Anyone who has ever been part of a team and given even a little thought as to what elements make a team function well will be unsurprised by the list.  The reason that the author says the laws are "indisuptable," is that the laws are so obvious that anyone can see that they seem to generally hold.  Don't waste your time with this book.  Instead, check out "First, Break all the Rules," which is an innovative work that addresses management issues (including teamwork) 
 I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of.  In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms.  Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.    I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books.  But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again.  The hermit in the woods that knows everything.  State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies.  Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position.  It just seems a bit lazy.  I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.  I should mention that I didn't actually "read" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version 
 adding more magical abilities to fighters... if u thought clerics were powerful try tanks with spell like abilitie 
 I never received product as they never shipped it. Amazon sent me an email stating that they couldn't complete my order as it was "non-deliverable".. Not sure what that means if every other item I purchase is "deliverable" 
 Maybe it's the fault of the internet, a medium seemingly designed to expose the user to the worst possible grammar and spelling. Possibly it's the fact that I speak only English; if I was a speaker of Portuguese, I might have enjoyed this more.  The joke, "Look at this phrase: Isn't it bizarre?" is repeated hundreds of times. Keeping in mind that it wasn't authored to be a humorous book does give one a chuckle, as does the background story, but that means the back cover represents the best of the book.  
 The best thing about this book is the preface by Charles Rosen. The rest it hugely disappointing. It is amazing how a poet can be so  non-descriptive! How can any writer has been friends with both Mozart and  Casanova and yet have nothing to say about them? One gets no sense of what  life was like during the end of the 18th century at all. Even Da Ponte's  own thoughts and motives do not come across. All that is left are petty  political games at an assortment of different opera houses. Da Ponte's  story is less amusing than the description of a single flirtation in the  truly interesting and picaresque memoirs of his friend Casanova 
 The songs on this c.d. are just plain wack. I loved the old Juvenile so i thought i may as well go ahead and buy this album. But I was wrong to do that. Juvenile's last album was hot and this album was nowhere near that. No creativity and the hooks sucked. Production was also awful. Sorry Juve but this album was not your best. Could have done a lot better 
 This book is designed for mega body builders who want advice on taking lots of supplements in order to bulk up and obtain the type of physique shown on the cover.  It is not very good at explaining how to get maximum nutritional value from food in order to more efficiently burn fat, which is what I was hoping for 
 This author show's himself to be racist and oblivious to Star Trek's main theme: i.e. not just inclusion of all races and species but taking delight and enjoyment in each person's differences. The meaning of the term I.D.I.C. first used in the original series.  Star Trek made ground-breaking statements about race and race relations in the 60's and some of it's ideas about it have become the norm in our society. Because the show's later incarnations do not seem to be screaming diatribes against  society this author apparently considers Trek to be a "sell-out."  Apparently since the phenomenon that is Star Trek isn't obsessed with Victim studies and doesn't dwell on injustices hundreds of years in it's past and is instead concerned with a future in which everyone is included it represents a "white future."  Apparently accepting all races, creeds, and even species is a "white future."  Whatever "future" Star Trek represents, let's hope that one day we here on Earth are lucky enough to enjoy just a sliver of that future's acceptance, cooperation, even indifference to race.  Until "victim studies" experts like Daniel Bernardi drop their continued insistence on the long dead past, people who consider themselves to be of different races(there is no such thing - scientifically it's all climate adaptation - there is, in truth, only one human race) those ignorant enough to only see themselves through the miopia of race will never accept one another as well as envisioned in Star Trek's future 
 I loved it.  A bit confusing with all of the names but well done.  Stephen White is not kind to the reader, I appreciate this.  He kills off beloved characters, not just the homeless and unconnected.  He gives the reader a chance to grieve along with his characters.    Well done 
 There might be a good idea for a joke - but it just does not come out funny. That's about all I can say about this amazingly overrated book. Seems to have all the ingredients to be good: Great Ohio Desert (G.O.D) - funny, the names of the people - funny, and so on. Came out to be - just boring. Pretentious dull dialogue. Pretentious dull characters. I was reading it in a morbid disbelief, that lasted for more than half of the book. It is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once I passed the halfbook mark - I usually want to know "what happened". It kept me going here for some more pages - and then I decided: nothing of it really happened, does not matter, waste of time. None of the characters, surroundings or events were in any way interesting 
 Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own 
 This is overall a real hoot! Anthony Hopkins is superb! "Fats" the dummy steals lots of the scenes.  The question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the Dummy or Ann Margarett trying to act!  Burgess Meredith is great as the manager. One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith.  He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see "Fats", but during some of the more "romantic " scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.  Don,t miss the extras where they talk with the real "vent" that worked with them on the movie.   If you like movies that are a bit "outside" this is a must have for any collection.  Pete Cavan 
 I got this book right after it came out and read it the same day I bought it. It was...to put it mildly..horrible. Several times throughout the book I thought I was going to have to make a run for the bathroom to empty the contents of my stomach. I kept on hoping that it would pick itself up and turn around until I reached the end and found that it would never be able to do so. When finished, I found that this book left me with a nauseated feeling and I could not read for close to 6 months for fear of something similar happening in another book. I do not recommend this book for anyone, especially people of the younger generation. What went wrong that Dekker's writing style changed so dramatically? 
 This book isnt worth the money you pay for it. It's only the ladys negative opinions on EVERYTHING without any facts or real information. 
 Nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing ? It looks good but is it 4"X 8"  or  12" X 8" ?   Sure would be nice to know the size before I buy............. da Trol 
 i have to say that i enjoyed this book  it was a good read, however i just found that it was not what i was expecting.  some useful point, and some simple truths, yet not what i was expecting and i found much of what others had to say misleading.  a good place to start though 
 Great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken. Amazon, how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer doesn't pack them well enough for shipping?   Amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an Amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go. Any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic. I've received two of those lovely surprises, the first set I ordered and the replacement set. Oh boy, I give up!   The canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them. Just imagine the UPS guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard. THEY BREAK!  Amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement (in this case) so it's like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage. Are you feeling lucky??? If so then roll the dice 
 I love this book and my son loves it too but really- I think they keep selling so many copies because people have to buy multiples when they fall apart!!!!  It would be great if they could make this in a board book without the spiral plastic ring and/or laminated pages to prevent tearing off the spiral ring. The pages easily rip off.  At $10 bucks each- I feel "ripped" off 
 I felt it was very scientific and difficult reading.  I wasn't able to get past 20 minutes with this book although I am sure by the title it has great information in it.  I don't feel it's for the average person more medical / scentific minds.   Truthfully, I feel my money was wasted and wish I would of took the time to return it.   
 I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  I have always enjoyed Frankenstein's monster.  He probably is my favorite classic horror icon.  I have seen a lot of different Frankenstein films; some of them are cheesy, but fun.  I also have watched different versions of Mary Shelly's book and I enjoy them all, some more than others.  This film's plot takes a kind of continuation of Shelly's novel with some name changes.    First of all it is extremely drawn out.  The plot just drags on with very little action or real character development.  The monster is very basic looking.  He has very little scaring, and is not very big or intimidating.  He is just a basic 6-foot man with semi long hair wearing a hood.   Doctor Victor Helios is an interesting character; basically he has been keeping himself alive for the couple of centuries trying to replace humanity with a superior race.  The monster is his first prototype from the eighteenth century who is trying to stop Helios. The whole idea of this film is pretty original, but it just was portrayed in a very slow and boring way.    I just had a very hard time making through the movie.  Finally the film just ends and the viewer is left with too many unanswered questions.  What was keeping me from giving this film 1 star rating is other reviewers of the movie stated it was a pilot for a television show that was going to air on USA network but never did and fell through. Finding that piece of information helps me understand why the film just ends without any real closure.  Also the cinematography is done well for a made-for-TV-movie.  But this film just does not stand well on it's own.  The idea was in the right place but it just did not work right at all. 
 Colson's version of what happened during Watergate is a self-serving, sanctimonious whitewash of what he did and what he was responsible for. As the self-syled " Go-to guy" when something needed to be done. As Howard Hunt's boss, it defies belief that he was ignorant of what went on. He managed to get away without any responsibility for what he was surely guilty of and plead guilty to a crime of his choosing, which he hoped not to serve any time for.Surely to be "Born Again" he needs to tell the whole truth rather than this sanitized version 
 I think the fact that the average rating for this album is 4 stars is a bit of an inflation.  Don't get me wrong, I own all their recordings and love The Band just as much as anybody else, but this album, though it has a couple highlights, sounds mostly burnt-out and hollow, making it subpar (for ANY band) and WAY lower quality than we've come to expect from The Band.  I'll start with the negatives, since they mostly outweigh the positives, then move to the album's highlights later (please remember, I'm trying to take off the rose-colored glasses and be realistic about this album).  First off, as everyone knows, this collection of songs is, and never was, an album.  It's a collection of unreleased studio tracks strung together to fill The Band's contract.  Consequently, the songs weren't conceived as part of a cohesive whole and the album has no flow whatsoever.  Likewise, the rest of the album reflects this: a lack of attention, care, and soul.  By this point, a lot of Robbie's writing became really tired and forced--listen to "The Saga of Pepote Rouge," and "Let The Night Fall," and you'll see what I mean (spaceships?!).  There's not much inspiration, and he seems to be ineffectively trying to follow stock song blueprints that worked on their better albums.  The magic that buoyed Northern Lights - Southern Cross, making it one of their strongest records ever, is pretty much completely absent, which is a pity.  You can really tell on these songs just how bad Robertson wanted to be done with The Band and move on.  The playing is pretty similar.  The Band members go through the motions, passing around lead vocals, Garth plays a bunch of instruments (a lot of easy-listening sax this time around, not really to my taste), and Robbie contributes some pretty gnarly guitar, though it's not supported by well-written songs.  Although the songs are pleasant enough, there's not really much to get excited about, and it really sounds like the musicians aren't emotionally invested and inspired in making these songs as good as they can be.  On a final note, "Knockin' Lost John" reminds us why Robbie didn't and shouldn't have sung on almost all of the Band's releases.  Now on to the album's saving graces, since there are a few.  No matter how bland the songs and how uninspired the playing, it's still The Band doing it, which counts for something.  Even though much of their signature sound is being replaced with a more late-70's lite-pop production, it's still a bit of a pleasure to hear Rick's, Levon's and Richard's voices.  "Georgia On My Mind" is worth the price of admission all by itself.  Richard Manuel's voice was getting pretty haggard due to his hard living, but I'll be if it didn't add even more soul and texture to his always sublime vocals--I could listen to the guy sing grocery lists and probably still be entertained.  Robertson actually did write a couple decent tunes, like "Christmas Must Be Tonight" (although an arguably better version was already released as a bonus track on the superior Northern Lights - Southern Cross), and "Right As Rain" isn't too bad, though it really doesn't sound like The Band.  It's also pretty cool that Rick Danko helped out with the songwriting with "Street Walker" (Robertson always complained that he had to do all the work), even though it's not that great of a song.  Unfortunately, though, most of the album's good points are only mildly pleasant, and after it's over you get the feeling you've just listened to something with little substance that The Band cared about just as much as you probably did.  I'll probably get axed by hardcore fans for not giving it 5 stars, but seriously, it's not worth that many by anyone's standards.  If Islands deserves 5 stars, how much is Music From Big Pink worth?!  I'm glad I own it because of its highlights and because I'm a completist, but not everybody is.  Islands certainly isn't essential, but you might get some enjoyment out of it.  Just make sure you have everything else first 
 If you are an avid horror reader, I do not recommend this book. It is not as intelligently written as others would like you to believe.  Priest's writing style is so condescending and gutless, I was stunned to read the five star reviews on this page.   Never was I scared or even mildly affected while reading this book--the descriptions were vague, very little suspense, hugely predictable, and a heroine with no personality.  This book is for teenagers and perhaps the early 20's coffee house crowd, but if you read Susan Hill, Dan Simmons, Stephen King, Shirley Jackson, Peter Straub, Matheson, i.e., the pros, spare your money on this one.  It's highly overrated, and you will be disappointed 
 My husband had only been gone for a handful of days when I ordered this book.  I read all the reviews here and thought that the "religious" aspect would somehow be acceptable, perhaps very helpful.  I was stopped dead in my tracks when I read the following:  "At its very nature death is demonic, and you cannot explain the demonic.  Death happens.  It is not really God's fault, nor yours, nor that of your spouse.  Death is the devil's calling card."  Are you kidding me?  I lost my husband!  He died!  In the context of searching for spiritual understanding, the idea that the devil is responsible for my beloved husband's death is absurd.  Even if the practical, therapy half of this book might be helpful...it is made null and void in my mind by allowing such utterly nonsensical and antiquated thinking to prevail.  I quote further:  "Lazarus will come storming from the tomb.  Death can't hold him back with the power of Christ on his side.  Jesus is weeping because sin has broken this world, and death is a symbol of that brokenness.  Even though he has the power to fix it, Jesus grieves."  Am I to believe that my husband's death is punishment for "original sin"?  The message here is that we, "man", are the cause of the curse of death, through sin we have brought death upon ourselves and only at the second coming of the Messiah will we be "resurrected".    If these ideas bring comfort to those who grieve the loss of a spouse, then this is a good book to read.  I write this only as a warning to those who might have different "religious", spiritual or "Christian" beliefs, or those who may be seeking spiritual guidance.  The opinions set down in this book can be very discomforting and offensive.  
 The jacket story and reviews got me to buy this book... what a waste of money.  The characters are weak stereotypes and the storyline's nothing special at all.  I guess in this day and age anyone can publish a book about nothing, but to make matters worse Hallman's writing (I think he likes to think of himself as a research journalist) is laughable and his research deplorable.  He tries to write a revisionist history through the eyes of a self-admitted novice perspective and makes a fool of himself.    Being a chess enthusiast, I figured I would push on for awhile.  To my horror his description of his chess-master pal is a disgrace to most chess players; making them seem like anti-social, self-absorbed bums that are out of touch with reality and politics.  Though this stock character may make for interesting reading in the hands of an average author, Hallman brings out the worst in stereotyping and one ends up disliking those we need to like in order to make the story readable.  Hallman overexerts himself to find tangents of interest, even tracking down a lama (of which are a dime a dozen in the area he's interested in) that renounced his vows in favor of rock'n'roll.  The connection is so labored that Hallman seems like one of those people you run into at a party that makes sure you understand how important they are because they went to school with George Clooney's cousin.  Calling Hallman's writing incoherent babbling would be an insult to the deranged... NEVER BUY THIS BOOK.    May not agree with me- doesn't make it unhelpful!!! And don't say I didn't warn you 
 I ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here. BIG MISTAKE. Upon setting everything up, it all worked great for about two hours... then the dreaded "UNPLUG/PROTECT" screen came up. Now it won't turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode. (and no, it's not a short in the wires or overheating... it protects even when stone cold, and with no speakers plugged in) I called sony and they say it is a short in the box. So now my two options are to unhook everything, repack EXACTLY the way it came to me and reship back to the online store I bought it from (with enormous hastle and expense) or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center (which happens to be across town, and only open monday-friday, 9-5pm. So much for being convenient). This thing is brand new and already needs repairs!!  On top of that, even out of the box, NONE of the video inputs worked. Audio was fine, but video was dead as a doornail, right from the start.  And even on top of the fact that this machine CAME broken... it sucks even when it works right! The DVDs take forever to load, and it comes with HDMI out, but NO HDMI IN! So if you're an HDMI user, I hope you have multiple HDMI inputs on your television... one for your cable box, one for this crappy system.  This is a piece of junk. For the love of god, don't waste your money 
 THIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST, SILLY, TOTALLY MISDIRECTED MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED "DISASTERS IN NATURE MOVIES". I WAS NOT DISAPOINTED. THIS WAS TRULY A HORRIFIC CATASTROPHE. THE BEST PART  OF THE MOVIE WAS.....WAS..... WAS.....I AM GETTING THERE..............  THE STORY HAD NO MEANING. ADRIENNE BARBEAU SHOULD SELL RAFFLE TICKETS THE NEXT TIME SHE NEEDS MONEY. HER TALENTS WERE TOTALLY WASTED. HERS WAS THE ONLY TALENTS BEING WASTED; NO ONE ELSE IN THE MOVIE HAD ANY.  THIS DVD ALSO WILL DO NOTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, AS IT IS GOING STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE. IF RYAN STARR WANTS AN OSCAR SHE'D BETTER START BY ASKING HIM OUT ON A DATE, BECAUSE JULIA ROBERTS AND HALLE BERRY HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTIME SOON. SHE DOES HAVE POTENTIAL THOUGH. THERE WAS NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THE BAND MEMBERS. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THEIR ACTIONS. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR OF THIS SEWAGE ON SCREEN 
 The follow-up to Crossfade's self-titled debut is...well, it just not as good. In fact, I hated this album.  The only good songs are "Already Gone", "Invincible", and "Drown You Out."  I tried to like the rest, I really did.  But after listening to the album numerous times, I couldn't helping feeling like i wasted my money.  I expected so much more from Crossfade.  Seemingly all the songs have the same recurring theme (the word "pain" is used in several), and the tone of the songs just doesn't flow very well.  Several songs have a number of different melodies, stopping and then starting again.  It seems as if the band was experimenting and didn't know what kind of sound they were looking for, and the album suffers from it.  BOTTOM LINE:  borrow the album from a friend, then download the songs.  Don't waste your money 
 I was a little disappointed in this book because of the limitations in sizing.  Although it is well presented, some of the projects are elementary enough that you can figure them out for yourself.  But the two girls I was going to get the book for, one is an XS and the other is XL, there wasn't much in the book for either of them.  And not a lot of direction on how to alter a pattern.  "Teen Knitting Club" implies that is for ages 13-19 and there are quite a range of sizes in those years.  
 a better title for this book might be, strange signposts in an otherwise interesting world.  He became a devout Catholic while the rest of us were questioning its relevance. C. Pierce's psychologic discovery or insight does not seem especially significant.  This MD does not provide the right presciption for our times 
 This book took me a long time to finish, almost a month, I think. It is slow paced and tends to spin off as if they took a lot of filler from other books that was edited out and crammed them in here.  Spinning towards a vapid, hippie ending, it does nothing to save itself from being God awful. Tragically, I think this was a best seller.   D 
 This book is seriously flawed.  Utterly implausible plot, unconvincing dialogue, seriously stupid characters.  The writing was so tedious I had to skip entire pages of drivel just to get through it.  The book was so badly written, I threw the book down several times from sheer frustration.  I forced myself to finish the book, but never again.  Ludlum is on my "Avoid" list 
 Don't let this book scare you away from going to law school. Montauk suggests a JD will only be helpful for a career in law, yet he is now a consultant. If someone has Richard Montauk's address, let me know. I'd like to send him back this book 
 This is a rather peculiar and disappointing book that reads as if it was written in a hurry. There are points where the text breaks down into short, disjointed and purely descriptive sentences that - given that this is supposedly an academic book - really makes one wonder what point the author is trying to make. Whilst the basic information is all good, there were a few inaccuracies, such as  in the chapter on Danny Elfman - the score of is Batman is NOT at the University of Texas in Austin, and the source she cites for the information is simply misquoted. Overall, in terms of Burton and his films, this doesn't offer anything obviously new, and parts of the book read like a precise of other authors rather than her own arguments. Her single unique selling point is looking at Burton's film making in the context of Alfred Jarry's pataphysics and the idea of surrealism (Jarry was one of the late 19th/ early 20th century figures who inspired surrealism). Nothing wrong with this - "surreal" is a commonly used adjective when discussing Burton's work - but overall the book comes across as rushed and flimsy. There's a good book in here struggling to get out, but it needed a good hard edit before being published 
   This has to be THE WORST western movie ever. I do believe the actors that appeared in this movie did it just to have the chance to work together, because honestly I can't find a logical reason why someone like Gene Hackman would actually appear in such a ridiculous flick. Follow my advice on this one DO NOT BUY 
 I would have rated this book with no star if I could. Severin was such a horrific character. Forget about the rape scene, what about the one where Severin punished Hastings for being jealous of Lady Marjorie by tying her to the ground and made her eat on the floor with his dogs in front of everyone in the dining hall????!! Is that supposed to be romantic? This is suppposed to be a romance novel, not strictly historical fiction. As such, there has to be some romantic element to the story, but I found nothing romantic whatsoever between Hastings' and severin's relationship. This is definitely the worst book I've ever read bar none! 
 Although, I am sure the doll shown in the photo would delight many girls, the doll is not the one that is described. The description stated she would swim like a mermaid, this is why I bought this particular doll. When I recieved it, it was a doll with legs and cloth mermaid outfit. Some how the picture and product description are of two different items. I hope this is or was corrected since my purchase in early December 
  Simply put: Don't support the Faux News Channel or anyone affiliated with it.  There are much better ways to spend your hard earned money 
 This book is very comprehensive, which is either a blessing or curse depending on your background. As someone who knew nothing about Islam prior to reading this book, I was frequently overwhelmed by the mass of information that Lapidus has arranged. As you may notice by the sheer volume of this 970 page book, it is VERY wordy. Like most history texts, it is also very dry and devoid of emotion. The author does, however, provide a complex view of Islam that is fair and accurate 
 ... but doesn't really touch anything the new digital shooter would be interested in.  If you're shooting film and you're looking for a simple primer on low-light, it's not too bad. Be warned, however- it's a pretty basic book.  Apart from a good few pages on tricks with flashlights, and one or two truely stunning photos, it's a generally pedestrian take on the subject.  Digital shooters are advised to look elsewhere 
 Silone's communist message is outdated. More, he makes the cardinal error to believe that solidarity is a basic human characteristic: 'Bread is made of many grains of corn, wine is made of many grapes, so it means unity. Unity of similar, equal, useful things. Hence truth and fraternity are also things that go well together.' But, man shows only solidarity if there is a 'personal' gain. Pure altruism is absolutely no option in the struggle for survival.  His picture of mankind is static, too rosy and naive. His belief in the proletariat is obsessive: 'the poor are uncontaminated by greed for property.' Hence, he proposes the abolishing of private ownership of land. 'Evil is only everything that prevents millions of people from becoming human.' For Silone, evil is not a basic and intrinsic part of the human character. He doesn't understand that all proletarians want their children to become (not static) doctors, engineers, lawyers, economists ..., in other words 'bourgeois'. In Stalin's Soviet Union, he sees only a fraternity of peasants and workers. The political role of the Catholic Church nowadays is marginalized. In Italy, they even don't have a Christian Party anymore.  Of course, the main character poses certain questions: had that (communist) community not itself become a synagogue? abandoned the critical spirit? the risks of conspirational struggles? His answer is no. He refutes that the communists aspire too to totalitarian power and orthodoxy and that a black inquisition will be followed by a red one. His return to his homeland 'had been basically an attempt to escape that professionalism', and he has the 'hope of one day playing a big role'.  Like a fanatically convinced Christian missionary, he tries desperately to sell his communist gospel to the poor cafoni. Unfortunately, they are terribly conservative ('it has always been so') and his message falls on deaf ears.  What is left in this book are the struggles against a totalitarian (here fascist) regime and against the butchery of war. It is partly very melodramatic (e.g. the confession at the end) and its main symbolism (a marxist apostle disguised as a priest) irrealistic.  I prefer Silone's more direct and less apostolical 'Fontamara' and recommend highly his masterpiece 'Emergency Exit' 
 I am very disappointed with your service.I am unable to view this dvd as it is not compatible with the australian system.I informed your company by email but received no response.I will not buy from you in the future 
 In the book introduction the author correctly states that most regexp texts and tutorial tend to concentrate just on the "easy" part: regexp syntax illustrated with a few examples, and do not give the reader even a little mastery in the art of using them. He then proceeds to writing another short and sweet useless syntax illustration. This "book" has no more useful material than you can find in a free web tutorial, so I suggest you save your money and stick with those, or go for a book that's worth some money: "Mastering Regular Expressions" by O' Reilly 
 by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit Pollard's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might. And while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion, (i.e. swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century) Pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of Christian virtue. This is basically saying Christians have lost a culture war without explaining why.   While the initial exposition on what the parameters of Christian modesty mean Pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of Christian modesty would be. Furthermore, when push comes to shove he refers to the Westminster Larger Catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused. Some of his cases are self-defeating. On one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century.  Props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting.  On the other hand, it's cheap so if you're not persuaded the research has been effective it won't cost you much 
 Jerry Garcia was a stone cold genius.  The Grateful Dead was his backup band.  Bob Weir's solo work is easily as good as the solo work of Bill Wyman, Keith Moon, Dave Davies, and Clarence Clemmons. From a 40 year career this is the "best" they could come up with 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I hoped after the rotten ending in book 3 that this would give us some sort of hope for a sequel so that Will and Lyra could be together again someday and maybe have more adventures. No, sorry. Not a chance. This is just a shameless way of getting another 10 bucks off the dumb reader (me) who hoped there might be some way that Pullman was going to go back to the world in His Dark Materials. To call this a teaser would be flattery. The story is only about 60 or so pages and frankly, not very good. It's as though Pullman is no longer comfortable with the characters in the Dark Materials trilogy. Lyra is almost a different person entirely and at the end of this teeny volume I was asking myself what was the point? The book is supposed to make the reader feel like they've stumbled upon papers and documents out of another world, a postcard here, a newspaper clipping there, but it falls flat. Ah well, he got me again. I bought this hoping for more that a flat short story about a girl named Lyra who in no way resembles the spunky heroine of the Dark Materials trilogy. Luckily, I was able to return this so I'm not totally ripped off. It's just a shame, kind of like the ending to the trilogy. Buy with caution or check it out of the library 
 As another reviewer put it, this book was a chore to read. I don't know why I stuck with it, but I hate to not finish a book. The characters are so poorly drawn that it's impossible to care about any of them. They're also unlikeable for the most part. Others have commented on how Rachel continues to be drawn to Hank in spite of the fact that he's so mean and misogynistic. That's true, but I also can't see what Hank sees in Rachel -- I can't see the appeal. The dialog was completely unbelievable, and the story dragged. In all, a waste of time. In the end I dropped it in the trash, which I never do because I love books. I just wanted to protect other innocents from this drivel 
 Well the title of this book suckered me into purchasing it. This book is a joke and the author should be ashamed of himself. There is nothing easy about this, so the title is very misleading and is an obvious ploy to get you to buy the book. It has the same old problems of your dull, dense, jargon filled college text book. There just isn't enough explanations and the few that are in the book assume to much on the readers behalf and you still end up feeling stumped and disappointed that you didn't learn the skills. I wish I could recommend a different book for you guys out there struggling with ecnm 151 but I just haven't found a good book or an easier way to learn it....or should I say a way to learn it at all. If you want my advice, find the easiest teacher around that gives essay questions on tests or this class will hold you up from getting your degree. Also, study in groups if you can even though this is a luxury given the time constraints of college and insanely fast pace of ecnm classes. One final piece of advice is buy your college text book and start going through it a semester before you take the class because if you get a professor with and attitude and a liking to multiple choice questions your going to have a hard time. There is just too much subject matter here to master in a semester. Your professor mastered it because he/she teaches it, so don't feel bad if you get left behind on this subject. This is a typical college text book and class. They expect you to learn something on your own that you don't know in the first place and believe me you'll get no help from the instructors or this text book. The book seriously lacks explanations through out the text and on some of the more difficult and challenging problems. Oh and author if you read this...get an editor...sheesh. This book is just not a quality product 
 As far as I am concerned, '8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly' was a total waste of my money.  I've been following this workout and eating plan for over four months now and have seen no reduction in neither my belly size nor my weight.  Frankly, I was seeing more results from my old Denise Austin Low Impact Aerobic Workout tape than this, so it looks like I'm saying goodbye to Jorge and going back to Denise.  Sorry Jorge, I gave it my best shot but your plan just doesn't work for me 
 I hated "Live Evil" when it first came out, and I still do!  I should hasten to add that I'm a longtime jazz fan. My collection includes Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Ramsey Lewis, Dave Brubeck, Jimmy Smith, Keith Jarret, and countless others. I first started listening to jazz in 1959, and I've never stopped. But I hate this album. It has always struck me as Miles trying intentionally to be obnoxious - something he was quite good at - and succeeding all too well.  "Live Evil'" is a dissonant collection of squeaks, squawks, and thuds. It has no melody, no rhythm, no flow. It's just harsh and ugly. And the cover art is clearly racist in its intent. "Good" is portrayed as a Black woman, close to giving birth; "Evil" is a puffy, toadlike White woman surrounded by symbols of sickness and decay. Just imagine the outcry if any White musician had reversed these stereotypes and used them on an album cover!  (Note: After I posted this review, Amazon removed the illustration showing the album cover for "Live Evil" and substituted the artwork for a different album.  The art you see as of 12/2006 is NOT the art that appears on "Live Evil." 
 This watch stinks.  Crappy manual, the band is so big it could fit around my leg, and when I received it, IT DIDN'T WORK.  Now I have to pay extra to fix the band AND to get it working.  So much for what I thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch. I would've given it no stars if I could. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID - AVOID THIS WATCH 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 White Tantra seeks to conquer the demons we have inside, as opposed to enslaving ourselves to them. White Tantra ALWAYS teaches to RENOUNCE animal desire. This is how one becomes a purified soul, a Mahatma, an angel, an illuminated Master: these types of people have no lust, no desire, and are not controlled by animal instinct. How could an angel have lust? How could an angel have pride? To become an Illuminated Soul, we must remove all that is impure from the soul. Books and schools that teach how to awaken through lust, through the orgasm, through desire, are teaching BLACK TANTRA: they are teaching humanity how to awaken as Black Magicians. The purified soul has removed all animal instinct and pride, lust, fear, jealousy, attachment, etc.  By stumilating and feeding lust we only deepen our slavery to sensation and animal desire, thus increasing our karma and our suffering.  White Sexual Magic is the pure sexual activity of the Djinns, of the Angels, the Buddhas - for God creates through sex.  BE CLEAR: we create through our use of sex, but we can create either an Angel or a Demon.  For more information, read "The Perfect Matrimony," "The Revolution of Beelzebub," and "The Mysteries of the Fire" by Samael Aun Weor 
 I picked up a set of these sheets at $59 (for king) so don't feel I can kick all that much, but for pete's sake - $250 is sheer insanity. I ordered in lilac (received the crystal blue- no big deal, but still!). I read many of the reviews and wasn't too terribly concerned about the wrinkling issues since my concern is softness - period. However, wrinkle factor with these sheets is so extreme as to be almost funny; shrinkage is massive (after two washings, bottom sheet barely fits at all and i'll be tossing them out after 5 washings, would imagine). Biggest complaint is that, at least to me, they're truly NOT all that soft. As a matter of fact they feel more like a bizarre sort of denim to me...they did arrive quickly, though 
 This book is OK for learning what it covers. Also, considering Gussow's Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity was last published in 1983, age might also have been a factor. However, the regular Schaum's on this subject just came out in December 2006, and it has been extensively updated and covers the material this book covers and much more, plus it is just as easy to follow as this book is. You get an extra 300 pages of material for an extra two dollars. If you need to learn the material in this Easy Outline, you are going to eventually need to know the material in Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity, 2nd Edition, so you might as well just buy that one book 
 Possibility of an Island  Michel Houellebecq set a high conceptual standard with his book, The Elementary Particles, nearly 10 years ago.  Without entering the Science Fiction genre, he was able to do what the Best Science Fiction writers have been trying to do for three generations: Out-do Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World."  The Elementary Particles is a philosophical Tour de Force. If you have not read it, do!  The power of Houellebecq's vision is amazing. But, this venture into Science Fiction style writing is weak. The Possibility of an Island can not be saved by Houellebecq's profound human insight or social foresight. His sarcastic pop culture allusions read thinly like Salmon Rushdie references. The lack of conceptual grasp of technological context demonstrated in the sections of the book placed in future time are a distraction at best and damning at worst.  I chose not finish this book. 
 This appears to be a great product, however, I haven't had mine long enough to find out.  This will be the second time I have had to send it back because of a faulty FM modulator.  At ~$30.00 a trip (Electronica wants it back in 7 days and the bill to send it there is on you.) any savings you might get from ordering online, is eaten up fairly quickly.  If you require an FM modulator for your vehicle, I would recommend purchasing local so that you can return it without the hassle, and price. 
 I'm a Papp fan, so I was really disappointed in this disc, with its  relentless "getty-up, getty-up, getty-up" beat, and its tired disco themes. I realize 70's disco is getting re-hashed as a club music standard, woven into house music, with all the bells-n-whistles, and pleading vocals. Why? House music is not supposed to be clever/cute...  This CD is one that might keep a party going -- after the crowd has been sufficiently "lubricated" -- but there's just nothing here that grabs me. The mixing is flawless, but song choice is annoying. Especially track 7 "Back Together" by Hardsoul feat. Ron Carroll. The singer's voice is hard on the ears. At one point he delivers a high-pitched  moan over and over again. And this is a "club favorite"??  This CD is out of my rotation instantly. If you're into this house-goes-disco stuff, Soulfuric In the House is far better.. 
 THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH GETTING. IT'S JUST A BLANK BOOK [...] YOU CAN WRITE AJOURNAL IN ANY BOOK ESPECIALLY A RINGED NOTEBOOK WHICH IS CHEAPER AND BETTER. YOU CAN STILL TAKE THE ADVICE (NOT ORIGINALLY HERS, WRITING JOURNAL AND WRITING 5 THINGS YOU ARE GREATFUL FOR) JUST DON'T WRITE IT IN THE BOOK THEY SELL YOU BECAUSE THEY HARDLY GIVE YOU ANY SPACE 
 I received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. I was shocked, I order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this. 
 As Hamlet is Bloom's god one would have expected a more generous bible. Instead this is one of Bloom's most disappointing books, filled with the hot -air of exaggerated praise unjustified by  argument or evidence. This is Harold Bloom at his most -declarative placing Hamlet above and beyond all literary- and one would dare to say- human characters.  It is also quite a paltry text, padded with quotation. And it assumes a critical knowledge of Hamlet which I venture to say only few of even its most devoted readers and spectators possess. As there is a whole critical literature built on the subject of Hamlet's delay in executing his father's request for vengeance I thought that Bloom would in some meaningful way address this. The Hamlet of passion, of passion for Ophelia also, of passionate involvement with the deepest questions of meaning in life is somehow absent here. Instead we have a more detached playing and playful Hamlet, cruel to the point of testing our sympathy. In short 'the Hamlet' Bloom reads and worships is far from the Hamlet of most Tradition. And is far from the Hamlet whose tormented existential questionings have so enthralled so many readers through the generations. Instead of augmenting the name of Hamlet ,Bloom has perhaps made a minor wound in it- though of course Bloom is right in knowing that this character is too 'immortal' to really be wounded by any single critic, however important or great 
 Ever click on somebody's crappy web page from 1995 and think "Jesus Christ, what IS that terrifying sound!"? Well, it was probably a midi ripped from this CD. I think it's safe to conclude that "The Ned Nash Orchestra" is actually some nerd messing around with a synthesizer in his garage. If you're counting on sweeping renditions of classics, this is not for you. Then again this CD is not recommended for anybody who cries easily, suffers with migraines, or values music in general 
 I think this may have grazed my top ten list of bad horror movies (it is right up there with movies like "half-caste"). This just redefined the word bad. It is defecation. The best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an MTV boy band video: It has very bad acting, slow, generic killing scenes (each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you cannot see what they do to the victim) At least half of the movie is a generic music video (singing throughout the movie) You almost have to see it to believe it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend seeing it. This movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist. This movie will make you want to hurt someone, or vomit uncontrollably. It will make you want to peel your eyelids off with a fork. Oh and did I mention it was bad 
 "The Secret Language of Competitive Intelligence" consists of the usual assembly of anecdotes, accompanied by no clear credible means of assimilating intelligence or proceeding.  One example, in particular, struck a chord - AT&T's entry into the credit-card business, summarized by "Why should AT&T not enter the credit-card industry?"  One reason might be because it subsequently withdrew - I had such a card, and it was canceled by Citi Card because the free phone privileges were too expensive.  Regardless, clearly Fuld had drifted off-course - deciding to enter the credit-card business is a strategic, not a competitive-intelligence gathering issue.  Fuld notwithstanding, I still think the best path to competitive intelligence is to keep abrest of the business literature (not just your own industry - sometimes innovations in other areas can be applied into one's own; use the Internet, business conferences, and business magazines), interview applicants from competitor companies, ask your most alert customers what they'd like to see and what they're looking forward to (from anyone), and similarly inquire of your best suppliers regarding new innovations they are planning or aware of.    In addition, periodically ask yourself/associates, "What if . . .?"  (Eg.  Macy's, Nordstroms, etc. should be wondering "What if Wal-Mart started selling up-market clothes?"  This is particularly important because it's no secret that they are planning to do so, and this could decimate high-market department stores.  So, how are they likely to start, who knows what, etc.  Finally, regardless of source, keep the information in a handy notebook, grouped in some useful manner.  (P.S.  There is no "secret" language of competitive intelligence.)  Hopefully this review saved you $15.72, plus shipping and the time wasted reading a boring 320 pages 
 Read the reviews and checked out the book.  What's wrong with the narrator?  Since this is a "fictional" biography, the narrator can wiggle his way in and out of funky --I mean, funky situations.  I sense a neurotic writer who is probably insecure and a bit on the "edge" (not cutting edge, but psycho-edge), who used this book as therapy.   Yeah, the writer intrigues at a real elementary, base level. . .  The hapa is represented in such a pathetic way, I was wondering if Fulbeck was resurrecting the tragic, neurotic,psycho mulatto (the main character of this book is reminiscent of Soaphead Church of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye. . . Pathetic.  Bad representation of hapas.  Get over yourself!  Please don't speak for all hapa guys, just your "fictional, biographical" self.  Can we move into the 21st century with more realistic representations of hapas already! 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 A decent summary, even concise; a basic introduction to the conflagration that is referred to as the First World War.  As others have stated, this book is all three, but at the same time is superficial, pedestrian, and lacking in originality.  For example: "Since the Great War of 1914-1918 was fought on all the oceans of the world and ultimately involved belligerents from every continent, it can justifiably be termed a "world war".  But it was certainly not the first.  European powers had been fighting each other all over the globe for the previous 300 years." Those are the opening sentences in this short hardcover book of 143 (junior-sized) pages.  This book has 7 very simple maps; basically of various maps of Europe at this time, with almost nothing in detail of the battle lines of the conflict.  The author repeatedly mentions lines of defense & areas of attack, but offers no aids herein regarding maps and/or description. What you get from reading this work is not, in short, much better than what you'd get from a fairly decent encyclopedia treatment; and at least there you'd get a few color battle maps instead of the ink lines that suffice in this work.  Yes, this volume is billed as "A very short introduction"; I acknowledge that, and with the limitations that implies.  I just don't see why one would choose this selection; of, in effect, rice cakes simply because you may not be interested in having a heavy meal. My recommendation thus is to look to John Keegan or others for more value, substance, and insight concerning the "Great War". Cheers!   
 This book is not very useful for the average visitor to Ireland (one month or less...).  It only lists one B&B per town, if that; while the descriptions are very detailed, this does not give the reader much to go  on. If you want a broader view, you will want to find a different guide.   For my purposes (2 week visit), it was not useful 
 Poor quality. One of the screw driver is already broken by using 2 times. 
 This book is the biggest piece of literary trash I have seen in a long time. It is a collection of peace-mongering propaganda that seems to take issue with political reality as much as the author does in her own life. The agendas in her poems spoil the spirit of the pieces and make the reader resent the author. The poems are rather sophomoric at best, and are poorly written. Most of them make no sense; you would have to be inside Ms. Walker's head to comprehend her contorted style. It appears that Ms. Walker should re-enroll in a college level poetry class. THIS BOOK IS TRASH. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK--I TOOK MY COPY BACK AFTER 24 HOURS 
 this book is okay for a beginners intro to iran but it misconstrues completely some of the facts of iranian history.  mossdaegh did NOT assume dicatatorial powers, and at times it seems that ms mackey feels sympathy for the shah.  the crimes of SAVAK, the shah's secret police, arent well documented either.  dont waste your money- I recommend THE LAST GREAT REVOLUTION by Robin wright or PERSIAN MIRRORS by Elaine Sciolin 
 There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment! 
 My girlfriend and I recently bought two ultrasonic humidfiers -- this machine and an Air-O-Swiss 7135.  The Venta worked well when it worked.  However, it frequently stopped working for no apparent reason.  You could jiggle the thing, and it would go on and off.  We finally figured out that there was a defect in the little plunger on the bottom of the tank that controls the flow of water into the base.  The water wasn't flowing properly, and the machine stopped (as it should) because there was no water.  Took it back to the hardware store where we bought it, and the guy there said that lots of other people have had the same problem.  It may be number 1 in Germany, but it gets only 1 star here 
 .  This CD is the re-issue of her album'1986. This album was produced by Gerd Rochel (BERNHARD BRINK, DANUTA, INGRID PETERS, JUERGEN DREWS, The LORDS, OHIO EXPRESS, PATTY RYAN, The TREMELOES, WENCKE MYHRE).  Pay attention to Gerd Rochel's song "Don't Tell Me Lies".   
 In 1957 Ayn Rand published ATLAS SHRUGGED, her epic novel of individual freedom versus the mass state.  ATLAS SHRUGGED contained "Galt Speaks," a lengthy speech in which John Galt (the protagonist of the novel) sets forth the basics of Rand's philosophy, known as Objectivism.  FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL (FTNI) contains "Galt Speaks" and philosophical portions from her fiction.  It also includes a lengthy essay explaining Rand's philosophy of history, which will be the focus of my review.  Rand starts FTNI with two characters she believes define most of history: the Witch Doctor and Attila.  Attila rules by force and the Witch Doctor is his "ideas man."  History is largely the influence of the Witch Doctor on Attila.  The supreme Witch Doctor of the ancient world was Plato; the chief Witch Doctor of the modern era was Immanuel Kant.  Their antipode is Aristotle, the philosopher of reason and the real world, whose philosophy unfortunately contained elements of Plato's otherworldliness.  Through most of history the Witch Doctor has been calling the shots.  However, Aristotle's philosophy hasn't been completely forgotten and emerged, due to Thomas Aquinas, in the Renaissance and in the founding of the United States.  Ayn Rand purged Aristotle's thought from its remnants of Platonism.  With the publication of ATLAS SHRUGGED a core of new intellectuals is being formed, ready to save the world from irrationalism.  "Aristotle, Aquinas and Ayn" as Rand once put it.  Or, as one Objectivist thinker said: "The big three [Plato, Aristotle and Kant] are now the big four" adding, you guessed it, Ayn Rand to the list.    FTNI follows the Attila/Witch Doctor description with an analysis of the history of philosophy.  Rand critiques numerous philosophers and their influence on history: Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Comte, Spencer and others.  She gives little evidence that she has read any of these thinkers, much less understood them. For example, she says of Kant: "An action is moral, for Kant, only if one has no desire to perform it . . .  (p. 32)."  Where, Miss Rand, does Kant say this? Or, "[t]he prelude to the Renaissance was the return of Aristotle via Thomas Aquinas (p. 23)."  Doesn't she know of Aristotle's influence on theologians who influenced Aquinas, such as Albertus Magnus?  Moreover, in her praise of the Renaissance (which she claims was essentially Aristotelian) she is oblivious to the fact that the many important Renaissance thinkers were Platonists.    There isn't much good I can say about FNTI.  While reading it may encourage you to take an interest in philosophy, the hatchet job she does on individual philosophers, schools of philosophy, and their influence on history is likely to set your study of philosophy back by years.  Sure it's exciting to think you know something about history that hardly anyone else has knows, even those with doctorates in philosophy.  That's probably why FTNI and ATLAS SHRUGGED were the most exciting things I read in high school (with the possible exception of WORLDS IN COLLISION, where I learned that Earth almost collided with Mars and that Venus was a comet shot out from Jupiter). 
 The book had an impact on me. It did, for instance, tinker with my idea of what dating should be (or shoudl be like). But the book is like a dogmatic pile of rules that people should abide by. And worse still, the book is interwoven with scripture to make it sound like the Bible says such and such about dating, instead of Joshua Harris.   I know that his heart is in helping people grow in their relationships, but this book is written from a perspective high up on an alter of self-righteousness - and down below, the rest of the world, broken and depraved. I mean, as a student (and now I am a teacher), I have sat through many college courses where professors talk about the ideal of education - every child can learn, every parent cares, and every child comes with some innate bundle of intelligence. But the real classroom is nothing like this. When Harris talks about asking the father of the girl you are about to date for her hand in courtship, or when he discusses going to his father for advise or for his pastor for guidance, I think he is talking about an ideal that few people actually have access to. Should they? Perhaps. But this book is written in such a manner that says that unless you do this, then it is highly improbable that your relationship can survive - or better yet, be as good as his. 
 I bought this book for my CCNP recertification.  I ran into a bunch of stuff on the exam that was not covered in this book or was in greater detail than was covered by this book. I used Sybex books before on my original CCNP certification and I passed.  If I try to recertify, it won't be with one of those books.  I'll use Cisco Press.  Live and learn. 
 its just a review not enough to explain usmle type question 
 I tried hard to read this book as an intelligent challenge to my faith - only to find that Dawkin's arguements require a leap of faith also- something about how irrational he is about religion - seems to dump his scientific mind and operate on raw emotion - sometimes something more like hate at times.  The man has something to say - but he really should stick with the things that he can talk about intelligently rather than straying off into a rant. 
 First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc.   I bought this book with 2 other books "The superhero book" (visible ink production) and "500 comic book villains" (Baron's production) and none of them satisfied me.   However this book is the only one which provides all superheroes with "pictures" other books doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones.   i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics 
 I used to enjoyed Discover, but the past several months of their radicals changes, got me to think a real dumbing down.Once in awhile, they would put together a good article - but not constantly.How can we enlighten ourselves and improve our intelligence on science etc in the world stage.There are still many of us that do not want to be glued to the computer for science as we would for the tv.Discover's editorial staff ought to get their magazine back on track or the circulation and subscriber base is going to go down the tube. Thank goodness Scientific American, Astronomy, Sky and Telescope, Science News havent fallen down.I am not renewing my subscription unless Discover 'rediscovers' itself.How dumb Americans are! 
 THE FRIST time i saw this movie i hated it. however i saw it again. it still not that great but i own a copy. its good to watch ewhen i feel sick or am stuck in the house for some other reason. however the other two movies are much better 
 This book was required for one of my courses while earning my teacher certification.  I noticed that the author works at my university so I'm not too surprised that it was required and not just recommended.  The author, Mark Ryan, is very biased in his view of education.  To him there is no place in a classroom for traditional teaching styles.  It should be an open, student-directed learning environment where the teacher is a "guide on the side".  My 8th grade daughter is suffering through this type of teaching right now and I can tell you that leaning too much one way or the other isn't good.  When will the education community learn to use a little bit of all types of teaching philosophies rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water? If required to read this text, do so with a grain of salt.  Don't become another victim of teacher certification indoctrination like this author is 
 "Blood Dolls" is a confounding freakfest about which little of worth can be said... It begins with a quite literal indictment of corporate ethics as a pair of unscrupulous complicitors in an unethical business enterprise enter the world of a business "genius" who wears a long-discarded X-Files prop (literally copied from the episode "Grotesque") as a mask, has a morose clown for a butler, and keeps a dwarf around for no apparent reason other than to keep the general sideshow aura amped to an extreme level. This dwarf routinely tortures his encaged, all-female rock band, who, beside being surprisingly technically adept, do little more than provide nudity. Shortly into the proceedings, the cornball bloodletting starts, the billionaire reveals the disproportionately small head beneath the mask, and one of the complicitous nobodies is transformed into a "blood doll." These must be parodies of "Puppet Master," but since that film might as well have been a parody itself, that isn't saying much. The film exudes an air of sadism amid the camp, and occassionally meanders into utterly senseless philosophical musings culled pretty much directly from the sources they cite. The acting is awful; the characters and story, absurd. However, it's also pretty damn funny, in an Ed Wood-let's take this seriously even as it becomes increasingly absurd to-kind of way. Worth a rent for a camp conoisseur, but little else 
 This book contains a minimal amount of information required for a textbook for a computer architecture course.  The book contains a tear out cardboard page with a very good summary of MIPS assembly language.  This, unfortunately, is the most useful portion of the book.  Most likely, teachers use it because it is written by P&H, and is cheaper than their book Computer Architecture: a quantitative approach.    Many examples in the book are somewhat vague, and a little thought will show better methods than those presented for some of the hardware descriptions.  Most notably, the horrible design for a multiplier using 32 adders cascaded.  If I remember right, the book suggests this as a "better" approach.  Yuck!  Rip out and keep the MIPS cheat sheet, and spend your money on the Computer Architecture book by the same authors, which has real analysis and realistic solutions 
 Short choppy sentences with one page in color and the next in black and white left me wishing this book was done differently.  Loving nature, I wanted to really enjoy this story, but I didn't.  There were facts thrown in haphazardly with thoughts and there was absolutely no reason for the black and white harsh transition every other page into color.  I just didn't get the concept the illustrator was trying to portray.  I did like that the pages were made out of paper that felt like it was recycled just for this tree story.  And the introduction of, "Trees are very nice. They fill up the sky." was a nice way to start this book, and the ending of, "They wish they had one so they go home and plant a tree too." leaves you with a positive activity, but the rest of it was drab for me 
 The best thing you could do for yourself is don't subject yourself to reading this adolescent book.  If buying just a small thing from Tiffany's and using the shopping bag as a planter gives you a thrill, then this is for you.  Not me!  Sorry 
 James Horner has the reputation as a fine composer of film music, but he can also easily be placed in with John Williams, et. al. in the gamut of "film composers who blatantly borrow from classical music composers."  Williams is primo facto enemy no. 1, but Horner has been known to dip into the 19th century music barrel from time to time for ideas.  Alas, the soundtrack to "Willow" is one of these times.  As well as the music works in the film, and I believe does, this reviewer just cannot get over the similarity between the 'Escape fromt the Tavern" theme and the third movement of Schumann's "Rhenish" Symphony.  One would hope that he was not "phoning" this score in, but I cannot imagine I'm the only one to make this connection 
 The book is good but completely bent toward the conservative end.  I believe that to be truly 'Catholic' you must be represent all sides and be truly in the middle. This book shows only one side - and totally a conservative side - which is not really 'Catholic' according to canon law (I have a master's in theology and pastoral studies from a seminary)  I am sorry but it is not 'in the middle' of Catholcism but an extreme! Read it with care 
 If you do not know UML do not buy this book. It will not teach you UML 
 Seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that James Frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as Billy Crystal.  But then they can only put out the cotton-candy Coney Island fluff as '700 Sundays' is.    Granted, the book is based on Crystal's highly-praised Tony Award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al.  But it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night Kaddish.  Yet in ripping a page out of Billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went.  It probably went something like:   "Hey, bubby, how about writing a book talking about your 700 Sundays with your pop?"  "Well, I'm not a writer per se.  I just jot down a few notes here and there, and then go out and perform the material on stage."  "So here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have."  "It'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads."  "Don't worry, bubby, I know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers.  Here's their recipe: They'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages.  'How?' may you ask!  Well, they'll cut `em in half, then cut `em in half again.  And using big ink letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses; surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album -- Slap it all together between two hardcovers...It'll be just fine."  "Yes, but..."  "Don't worry.  Consider it like a vintage bottle of Mogen David 20/20 wine, aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout.  In this case, the local bookstores.  Oh, and make sure you give `em just enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and thirsty for more.  People'll drink it up."  "Yes, but..."  "Don't worry, Face.  Everybody loves ya.  Just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about Satchmo and Mantle, you'll be all right.  Don't forget now, we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too. Y'know `700 Mondays;' then `700 Tuesdays' and so on.  Yes'sir, I can see it all now:  We've got the lock on all those 700 days of the week shtick.  Oh, and we'll do some holiday editions too, starting with `700 Hanukkahs!'  "You're still friends with that kid, Adam Sandler, back from your SNL days, aren't ya?!  Yes, so we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that Hanukkah song of his.  It'll be a great collaboration.  It's good to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once you've made it. Y'know God blesses and doesn't forget those things by them who do.  Yes, ok, so we'll go ahead from there and do `700 Passovers!'  "And it'll be an annual event too, dont'cha know.  Just think, when people see Chuck Heston...may God keep a special place in heaven for him...when people see Chuck Heston and The Ten Commandments, they'll be thinking about you too, Billy.  Yes'sir, we'll have em crying and laughing every year on Passover, you'll see.  "Oh, and holy of holies, out of the deal we'll get `700 Yom Kippurs!'   You'll see.  But this will be only for our people, Billy, you understand.  So you might have to dig deep to get material for it.  But that's what authors do, they dig deep.  But you already knew that, right?  Can you dig it, man?  I knew that you could.  "Yes, but..."  "Don't worry, Face, everybody loves ya!  Your books don't have to be earth-shattering or thought-provoking or anything like that.  But hey listen, with a book deal, a books-on-tape deal, and who knows even a movie deal, we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets.  Mark my words we will.   "And say, since you haven't had a hit movie in awhile...no offense...we're going to get Martin Scorsese to produce and direct your life story.  Yes, it'll be something like 'Pinch Me I'm Still Jewish: The Billy Crystal Story' in widescreen and all that jazz.  It's what everybody in Hollywood's doing right now.  Yeah, no use waiting until your dying or dead already, Billy - God forbid.  No, siree, bubby!!    "So Scorsese will do the movie on the cheap, because God knows the man deserves an Oscar already.  You know it, I know it, we all know it, Billy.  And not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either, but the really big one, see!  And just imagine, wouldn't it be something if you were hosting the awards ceremony and handed Marty his own Oscar?!  Yes, well, we can schmooze on about all this stuff later.  "But for now, with the books and everything, you'll be a one-man franchise, yes you will!  You'll be on the New York Times Best Seller List from now until forever!  It'll be great!!"  "Yes, but..."  "Oh and well, I didn't want to say anything just yet, but, okay, here goes: There might be plans to expand everything too!  Listen, bubby, I know somebody who knows somebody who...you get the idea...over at the networks.    "We can do a little Chris Rock in the neighborhood sort of thing.  We'll put a kid who looks and acts like you - about as tall as you - into the neighborhood that you and your family lived in, see.    "And it's going to be a period piece too!  We'll introduce all the new kids to the stars of yesteryear -- y'know, Cantor, Jolson, Jessel, Durante!  Throw in some goniffs and shiksas that the cast can work off of every week -- It'll be fun!    "Chris Rock is great.  But you can be greater too.  Listen, Face, we'll make it a celebration.  Something like 'Growing up Mazel Tov!'  Maybe we get 700 shows out of it.  Maybe less, maybe more, but people will still love it anyway.  You'll see!"  "Yes, but, well, I'm not really a writer/author.  I'm an entertainer, so why would I want to do any of this?"  "We could make a couple of dollars!"  "Okay. I'm in!"  And so it went and so it goes.  Final analysis: A So Not Looking Mahvelous, Better Luck Next Time, With All Due Respect, Sadly Not Recommended Book.   
 I too had this book for a college 19th century art course. Most of the movements were not new to me and I dearly love most art of the period. But for anyone new to it this will be an incredibly boring read, too much bogged down in marxism and political correctness. Eisenman; a self-professed "Marxist-Art Historian" seems unable to speak of any movement without making it into classs warfare or accusing artists of being sexist or rascist, while completely ingnoring the historical context. As with many art history surveys Eisenman also suffers the delusion that there is something inherently wrong with academic art and that the only worthwhile art of the 19th century was made in France 
 I purchased this item last May, and although at first I was thrilled to have an automatic litter box, I soon realized that it was very noisy, difficult to clean (container holder is flimsy, gaps between holder and box mean litter spills out the side & underneath. To cut down on the mess, I purchased the tent to keep the litter inside.  Very bad idea!  Tent is flimsy, ripped upon assembly & makes it extremely difficult to empty box.  It seemed I was spending as much time maintaining this box as I was a regular litter box.  I was just about to order replacement cartridges (which don't really snap shut, by the way, when you go to take them out) when I decided to see what else is out there in the world of automatic litterboxes.  I purchased a Purrforma jumbo box, and, so far, it is wonderful.  It is sturdy, has a huge hood that you just lift off, is so quiet that it doesn't need a sleep timer like the littermaid one.  It is well thought out and I would urge anyone to spend the extra dollars to get it, it's a small price to pay for your sanity 
 I couldn't really finish this book, although it was interesting as history of religion it was pretty dry 
 Another young adult book by an author good at fairy tales, but this one is a collection of four fairy tales instead of a stand alone story. The book blurb says that two of the fairy tales are retellings and two are "new", but I found all of them to feel like retellings of stories I'd already heard. I didn't care for the book, but the kidlet loved it. He just likes McKinley, I think 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 This is quite possibly the most poorly written book I have ever seen. Like others on this site I will never again read a DS book. Talk about repetitive -- it got so bad that I began to underline everytime the main love interest was referred to as a "wacky artist". Between Chapters 5 and 7 the term was used 15 times, three times on one page. To make it worse, the "wacky artist" is also characterized as extremely immature and childlike, making him very unappealing to me, anyway. In the space of 3 pages the following phrases appear -- "looked like a big kid", "she felt like his mother", "his childlike style" "he was very needy sometimes, and self-centered, as children are", "he acted like a bored schoolboy", "pouting", "acted out, more often than not, like a child". What a bore. Both the book and the people in it 
 If I could I would have given this book no stars. The title is the best thing about this book. The comparisons between "City Girls" vs "Country Girl" really irritated me. She also wrote how just walking down the street in the big city you spend all your money. The section on decoration your home and your guy why should you decorate your place just to please someone else. If you like "flowers" I think you should add them.   I'm glad I saved my money and checked this book out from the library before I bought it. 
 I had to read this in school as a kid. The actual writing talent here is great but the subject matter is really depressing. I think a good story should have a nice balance of good/bad events. Steinbeck has none of that in this book. The Red Pony is just one dark cloud of doom throghout the entire book. Things go from bad to worse as the little boy's dreams are shattered. Some parts of it are also needlessly gross and bloody and I must admit that as a kid I was a little emotionally scarred from it! The book goes ubruptly to a totally different and unrelated story. As an adult I know it's meant to serve as some sort of metaphor but I still don't like this book and think it's a pointless read unless you want to be depressed or have a thing for tragic stories. I know it's supposed to be a classic, the problem is I don't know WHY! Some readers say "this is a great book for readers of all ages" but I would have to disagree! I don't think this is a kids book. I don't think kids should be forced to read this at school and I don't think I would ever read it again. 
 This book was a complete disappointment.  The content is obvious, the expertise less so.    Turbocharge?  No.  If you're asking "what cheesy, small-time, low-class things could I do to promote myself," yes this book has your answers.  If you have hard questions or are looking for serious advice, this is not the book for you 
 I waited for this movie to transcend the pretentious, derivitive visuals especially the awful artwork but it ended up being just as bad.  I read some of the reviews and the comments are consistently favorable of the visuals even if they did not like the movie.  The only way I can understand this is by also seeing that somehow the awful art of Thomas Kinkade is so popular.  It is so marketed and fake, served to you as great art.  That is exactly how this movie has been served to you, don't accept it find something real. 
 Our son has dyslexia.  We are using this as a tool to build his family of sounds and spelling rules.  He thinks it is fun and is building on his skills at the same time 
 Whenever I read a book and find obvious errors that I know about, and I am not even an investigative journalist, I wonder what else is wrong about it.  Ms. Nasar, it's Jacob Wirth Restaurant in Boston, not Jack Wirth and the law firm was Choate, Hall & Stewart, not Steward 
 This would have to be the worst album for the last couple of years. What makes it worse is that this band were the band to watch. they had  stunning debut and and even better follow up with the more things change. This however is just a bad CD. People can make up excuses like the production is bad or the band were experimenting, or the old school fans hated it because there were no solos.... whatever..  but the simple fact is that this album is awful. there a no good songs.. unfortunately i bought this whe it first came out and the limited edition red CD case really sticks out in my collection... worse still i have tried to get rid of this but no one wants it...... best advice i can give you is avoid this... Check out Machine Head 1997 release THE MORE THINGS CHANGE!! 
 I'm sorry - I absolutely loved "Instance" and was hoping for something of comparable caliber. Instead I found myself dreading the time I would waste slogging through it. Sort of the way I felt about Michael Chabon's "The Final Solution" when half-way through I realized that that's all there is and what a shame to waste the energy writing even a novella on so flimsy a framwork.  Lewis Libby's "The Apprentice" is a better rendition of the "slender little mystery elevated towards art" genre which isn't really saying all that much.  Spend your time reading "An Instance of the Fingerpost" twice. 
 If Hillary's a cult leader, then where's her cult? Because I'm one of the ones Rush, Hannity, Coulter and the rest would have you believe are scheming in the shadows for Hillary's overthrow of apple pie, baseball, and mothers.  I'm one of the wingnuttiest of the wingnuts (or is that "moonbattiest" of the "moonbats?" I get all of these childish epithets confused).  And as wingbatty as I am, I can't stand her.  I understand (disagree with, but understand) the suspicion of Soros.  Big money colluding behind closed doors with influential and powerful politicians.  But this isn't a liberal conspiracy; if you'll just read a gosh darn newspaper, you'll find it's a conservative reality (KBR, the Northern Mariana Islands, seriously, look 'em up).   What I don't understand is how Hillary has achieved boogeyman status.  Like I said, I'm one of the supposed leftist zombies you've been warned about and I'm far from alone in my distaste for and distrust of Hillary.  The only people whispering conspiratorially of Hillary's agenda or even her political potential are conservative pundits and their devotees.  She hardly comes up during our zombie get togethers, and when she does, it's negative as often as not.  Indeed, do you remember her tepid reception at the Coretta Scott King funeral, even with Bill by her side? There you go.  And do you also remember what happened to Lieberman in Connecticut? That's Hillary's future.  We don't like opportunistic, sleazy career politicians any more than you do.  
 Firstly this girl is fifteen, so I should be gentle when reviewing her? No. I may have been upset to see Michelle Branch go hillbilly when she was so close to leaving the pop-world for something meaningful, but to see this talentless little thing step up to ascend into her place is annoying.   This child cannot sing, period. Her voice is untrained and her natural ability is a karaoke night blitz at best. I've heard chalkboards stay in key more efficiently. If she wants to make pop garbage, throw away, bubblegum music for the forgetting masses, fine. There's a market, exploit it. But where some have talent, some have only looks.  This girl is a gorgeous, cute young blond put out there with a guitar to give the guise of a serious musician, but the record company is selling her looks because she has nothing else to sell. One can only hope she'll catch on to being used and either give up or get some vocal lessons and actually learn to sing. 
 Does anybody really care what the York Dumbell outfit did to exploit weightlifting or that Bobby Boy Puffman was just looking for a tax writeoff for his incredibly successful oil burner business?  I find this book boring and totally irrelevant. Recommend Dick Tylers West Coast Bodybuilding Scene instead of this one 
 This book was much thinner than I had expected and is devoid of color except for a few pages in the middle. Not much for the whopping price 
 I came to this book very interested in knowing more about Ho and to see this period of history told from the perspective of a figure not normally viewed as a major player.  Having previously read Paul Preston's biography of Franco (a long book), I was hoping this would be of similar quality (see my review of Preston's book).  It's not.  This book is very detailed.  As one of the other reviewers notes, there are specifics about all sorts of travels and meetings with all sorts of names, places, and times.  But, nothing really ties these things together to make a story.  It's so bad that I haven't finished the book and probably never will.  So, why 2 stars instead of a total blast of 0 or 1 star?  Because I do believe the author has been thorough and so this deserves some respect.  I just wish there had been an editor or someone to help turn this into a story.  And the final plug:  Preston's book about Franco is really good 
 This was the WORST sunshade ever!!!  Don't waste your money.  It is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all.  We used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies.   I do not recommend this product.  I only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option 
 This book attempts to prove what everyone already knows. Fones Wolf proves she has no depth and no real understanding of Twentieth century cultural and intellectual history. Her book is pitched toward the lamest of knee jerk liberals 
 Don't be fooled, this book is not rational, mystic, nor will it do anything to enlighten the reader.  The title of this book is as decieving as it possibly could be and if you are interested in any of the things mentioned (science, spirituality, myscicism, rationailsm, or enlightenment) this is NOT the book for you 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 This book gives an overview of ebay's creation and why it has been a success.  It gives no insider insights however.  It was fun to read but I did not learn much from it.  This book does not have substance 
 It's samples that you listen to are not the original recordings/artists. All new digital masters. Save your money. You will not like it and this will not be what you'll be expecting for those who support any albums of original recordings or artists. I mean SERIOUSLY!! 
 I tried many times to finish this book because once I buy it and start it, I hate to just walk away from it. BUT, this book did it. I was never really interested in the plot, I thought the writing was very basic, elementary actually, slow, and just plain boring. I tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up, but I never did get into to, making this the only book I've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing 
 I have to ask myself what is wrong with the title of this "Disney Treasure"? Oh I see  what the problem is its called the COMPLETE Pluto! its not even finished. 'On Ice' and 'Beach Picnic' were Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons and pluto starred in 48 cartoons and this set consists of 23 
 What is being called the "paperback" version of A Short History of Western Civilization here is in actuality not the paperback version at all but another paperback book entitled "A Study Guide to Accompany A Short History of Western Civilization from the 1600's." Richard Sullivan is not the author of THIS book. On the order form and on the packing slip it says "A Short History of Western Civilization" but it is not!  If what you want is a study guide for half of this book then go ahead and order it.  If you really want the entire Short History of Western Civilization book, then order the HARDCOVER version 
 I was very disappointed with this book and will be returning it.  If you have spent a few minutes playing with Moodle and read even a little of the online manual, this book adds nothing new. The system is easy to figure out, as most items are pretty self-explanatory and each option has a handy pop-up help screen that explains anything that you don't understand. The online documentation is very good.  I was hoping this book would explain how to do more advanced things in Moodle - how the many available add-on modules work and what they contribute to a finished system, tips and tricks to add videos and flash files to your courses, best practices for course development, advanced customizing, etc. But there was none of that in the book - only the same information that is already included free with Moodle. Save your money 
 This book was a great book. I like the way Trent was helped by Nick. One thing I didn't like was the violence. I am not a big fan of basketball, or any other sport, but this book really touched me. I would recommend this book to anyone even if they aren't a lover of sports. That is what I thought about Night Hoops.      Sunny Block 
 I originally read the novel (of which I assume most of the other reviewers are unaware) and watched the earlier German film of the same name for a college course entitled "Memory and Mourning in Post-War Germany."  I'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel. It seems that the director wanted to make a more "Hollywood" version of the film, and I think he succeeded. For instance, the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel, and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story.  In general, the film has little to do with any of the original versions, and is far inferior 
 I must admit. I am not Kings biggest fan. I like the way he writes characters, but for years, I haven't been able to put my finger on why I don't like his books. After reading The Colorado Kid, I realized what it was. King is a lazy writer. He can tell a good story, but he doesn't follow through. His typical way out of a jamb is to make some inanimate object talk. Bleh. You can tell when he is done with a story. It just ends.  This book is no exception. The story rambles through the mouth of a clichï¿½d old time reporter teaching a young'un the ropes. King tells the story, he doesn't show it. I kept waiting for the narrative to stop and for the action to begin, but it never did.  And the ending! Someone, his editor, agent, family or friends, tell Mr. King that mysteries are supposed to be resolved. He doesn't resolve this mystery. That was the only reason, other than the fact that I had a 7 hour flight and nothing else to do, that kept me reading. I got to the end and I swear I almost tossed the book while on the plane. There is an after word trying to justify his ending. I didn't get past the first sentence. Authors don't write justifications for their books unless they know they are guilty of something.  If I could take away all the stars on this book, I would. Even one star is one too many. 
 I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my 13 year old son, who is an avid reader.  I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the info available, because this book is NOT appropriate for a young teen.  Thankfully, I decided to 'peruse' the book prior to allowing my son to read it.  It was so graphic in language and content that I didn't even want to read it.  I managed to skim through two stories before I decided it was just too explicit for me 
 I am a shower maniac and I've tried at least 10 showerheads this last year. Although some worked nicely, their lifetime was too short.  I recently bought the MOEN REVOLUTION SHOWERHEAD.  WOW. It's like nothing I've seen or felt before. Try it. You will not be dissapointed 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 Joe Nickell is a very interesting character and has, without doubt, a lot of experience in investigation and trickery. He is the perfect sceptic. He also has assumedly a lot a friends in science, who are able to disprove several of his mentioned "alleged supernatural occurrences". So some of the chapters are very interesting and and the solutions he provides are looking plausible (i.e. Nazca Lines). It is fun reading these chapters.  In other cases his attempts to explain the reader, that something is indeed not mysterious or supernatural, is only a listing of assumptions and possible explanations without any scientific evidence (i.e. Wynchester House). I agree to him, that most of the occurences are explainable without the need of some mysterious background. What, in my opinion is a pity, is, that he complains, that most of the cited people have a strong fantasy and are not going to look for scientific explanations, but he is doing the same from his perspective.  In the the whole book I did not find the consideration, that some things are not supernatural, but in our days still mysterious, because our scientifc knowledge lacks of some things not discovered so far or methods not developed, yet. He is only searching for a prove for his doubts and if he cannot find one, claiming that it is disproved with providing a lot of assumptions (fantasy) without any scientifc evidence (i.e. acupucture stated as an example of intuitive healing).  As a good investigator, he should be more open minded to all possibilites and not only focused on trying to disprove everything 
 Rhino, in the liner notes for this CD, refers to the Gay Purr-ee soundtrack as having been restored from the original Warner master tapes.  What exactly has been restored is open to debate, as the entire album is marred with audible tape hiss and occasional dropouts. If any restoration of these elements took place, it isn't audible in the finished product.   It's still a "must have" for anyone who loves Judy Garland...but with the tiniest bit of effort, this long overdue CD could have been worlds better. As things stand, it's mediocre at best 
 As a former teacher and current homeschooler, I find that much of the material in the early levels of this series are not appropriate for the grade levels indicated.  I use the books as references but not usually at the grade indicated by the title of the book. The history sections are especially inappropriate. Children at these early grade levels do not have enough background knowledge (i.e., comprehension of the passage of time and the geography of the earth in relation to their own place in it) to fully understand the material presented. Thus, they are very unlikely to retain the knowledge or to apply it meaningfully to other areas of study. Parents trying to stick to these grade levels are bound to be frustrated 
 I really am sorry that I actually paid money for this book. Lester Young is my favorite sax player and when I saw a new biography out on him I jumped at buying it. Lester Young really is just a pawn here. The author basically uses Lester's experiences with racial discrimination as a launching pad to go on huge rants of "Well, Black people weren't allowed to do this" and "Black people weren't allowed to do that" rather than actually talking about Lester. If Danials is so intent on writing about the mistreatment of Black people then he should have written a book on that instead. I mean, let's be serious. Most of us have been learning about the Civil Rights Movement and how poorly Black people were treated in those times since second grade. This is an adult biography and I think that the vast majority of people out there already know that Black people were not treated fairly in those days. There is no reason to spend 70% of the book bickering about it. I recently read a biography on the Irish patriot Michael Collins that was excellent. The author could have taken the same approach as Danials and spent all his time complaining about how England was responsible for centuries of murder and terror in Ireland, but he didn't. The focus of the book was always on Collins. Don't let this lousy book deter you from other stuff on Lester. Lester is one of the most interesting (if not the MOST interesting) of all jazz musicians. For a much better read on Lester Young check out "You Just Fight For Your Life." It was written WAY better than this book and is probably the best biography on Pres out there. It's out of print so you would probably have to get it through your library. 
 I normally love fantasy, and I couldn't force myself to read past the halfway mark.  There was stilted dialogue, and flat main characters. Let's not forget the cringeworthy visual metaphors! Or the plot that seems like a bizarre lovechild of Rowling and Joss Whedon.  I don't know; the rest of the novel could be the best thing ever. Somehow, though, I doubt it, especially when supposed fans claim the characters are dull through the end of the novel. 
 There's very little in this book you couldn't learn from one of the free PDF downloads on the Daily Racing Form website.  It's an introduction to what happens in and around the track that doesn't help you at all with learning how to handicap.  Strictly lowest common denominator stuff, nothing that will help you think for yourself at the track.  You'd be better off picking up a copy of Brad Free's brilliant Handicapping 101 instead-- This one falls far below the usual Dummies standards 
 This was my first Carla Neggers read. I was surfing through on-line reviews (which I am very big on) and came across a recommendation for Dark Sky by Carla Neggers. As I'd never heard of her, I did some more digging and came upon nothing but accolades for the author. So I ran out and purchased Dark Sky and began reading. Before I got too far into the book, I figured out that there was another book that preceded it, and thought I'd be less confused if I stopped and read that one first.   So, obviously I did, and was totaly dissapointed. HORRIBLE. But I did FORCE myself to finish it through shear determination. The writing didn't flow well. There were a lot of errors in my copy, which got under my skin, but might not have if the book had been better. The plot and charachters (not to mention their actions-especially of the inn owners) were unconvincing. There was no build up. The suspense was flat. No chemistry between Rob and Maggie. I MEAN NONE. But yeah, they had sex. But we expect that. GIVE ME STEAM. I want some CHEMISTRY. The only redeaming quality about this book was the interation between Juliet and Ethan. They get the one star. If not for them I would probably never read one of this authors books again. For my interest in them, I'll read Dark Sky. The word "wanderlust" was used ad nauseum. Surely she could have come up with another word or description. Borrow if you must, but don't by. Better yet call me, and you can have my copy 
 "Bishop" Spong has turned out another "masterpiece." However, why not be honest and title the book, "Why I hate the Bible and Christians in general." I'm not entirely sure why Spong insists on calling himself a Christian but I do have a theory. Books by so-called Christians sell more then books by atheists. So why not write a book condemning all of Christianity all the while still calling yourself a Christian. Face it books sell that are believed to be by a "Christian author." Not to mention he gets a fat salary from the Anglican "Church."  Spong denies every single traditional doctrine of Christianity. He not only believes that homosexuality is not a sin but he actually believes that it is a virtue. If you are really interested in learning how to hate Christianity then this is the book for you. If morality to you is only that which suits your purposes and what you find convenient then Spong is your man. If you really want to know about what the bible actually says and who Jesus Christ really was then read the bible and consider something worthwhile to help guide you through a decent understanding of the Christian faith, like C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity" or Peter Kreeft's "Catholic Christianity." For those who want even a more basic understanding of the Christian Faith try Lee Strobel's "A case for Christ." It is evident that Spong has a deep seated hatred toward Christianity and Christians in general and his book does not even do the cause of liberal theology any good. 1 star because there is no minus 1000. 
 ``People  say again and again that philosophy  doesn't really progress, that we  arestill occupied  with the same philosophical problems as were  theGreeks.But  the people who say this don't understand why ishas to be  so. It is becauseour language has remained the same and  keeps seducing us  into asking the same questions.  As longas there continues to be a verb  'to be' that  looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and  'to  drink', as long as we stillhavethe adjectives  'identical', 'true',  'false', 'possible',as  long as we continueto talk of a river of time, of  an expanseof  space, etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no explanation seems capable of clearing up.And what'smore,this  satisfies  a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar  as peoplethinkthey can  see `the limits of human  understanding', theybelieve of course thatthey  can see  beyond these.``   ''Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language``  ``Ambition is the death of  thought'''  These three quotes are from Ludwig Wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out).Dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some40 years, is one them. It is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, John Searle, studied under famous Wittgensteinians (Searle with John Austin, Dennett with Gilbert Ryle) but Searle got the point and Dennett did not. Dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to Ryle, whose famous book 'The Concept of Mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  That book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  Dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes Wittgenstein, Ryle(andmany others since) have exposed in detail.   Byaccident,just before this book, I had  read ''The Minds I'', which Dennett coauthored withDouglas Hofstadter in 1981. They made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess---Nagel's `What is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of John  Searle's Chinese Room argument explaining why computers  don't think.   Nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  Searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does(eg,it can translate Chinese  without understanding it). Likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what countsas good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. Our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave,cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and anydiscussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. Wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. Unfortunately, he died inhis prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  worksand he never wroteany popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few.   Searle  is one of the world's leadingphilosophers and has written  manyextremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in Dennett'swork.His review ``Consciousness Explained  Away'' of Dennetts 1991 book`'Consciousness Explained'' and his book''The Mystery of Consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither Dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic)havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.Many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things, but it isclear that we are  nowhere near it now. Dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  Searle with vituperative personal attacks.Searle has been accused by Dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and Searle has made it very clear for 30 years that WE are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  He just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   Searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology'',the views ofDennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. Dennett repeats his  mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how! Unsurprisingly, there isnot one reference toWittgenstein or Searle in theentire book.There arehowever, many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is.   Like most people, it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo  certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite  unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the  world. They are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.Wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with.  Dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(whichI hopewe can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). He wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. However, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. Naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``Consciousness  Explained``.   It is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. Please recall the last sentence of Wittgenstein  from the opening quote: ''And what'smore,this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent, because, insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of  human understanding',theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond  these.`` The  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. If one is very, very  careful,some understanding is possible, but Dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand.   There are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and Dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. There is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  He knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. By extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). However, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. The  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. This  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes.   He correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  This obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  If so, they will definitely win at least one Nobel Prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). So, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). And while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  It is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  But infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer.   He starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, Schrodinger's  dead/alivecat etc) and as Feynmann said many times ``Nobody understandsphysics!'' Many think nobody ever will.   On pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` This is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.  On page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? Nobody but philosophers. We make choices. What's the problem?  One has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  What are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? I doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. This shows that there is something  strange about such questions. Wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. There are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. Decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'John will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  John might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. Some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, notbeing able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have.   One can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. Normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. This was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. It is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degeneratinggenetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  Hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' Let us alter Wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''As longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink',as long as we continueto talk of  freedom of action, of saying I  wish I had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up.''  As withmost philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. On page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? Even if I  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, I  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. Only then  can I go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if I had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  Wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  The ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. So I would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose.    On the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  He says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'It appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' And on page 13--''It is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. The whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do NOT learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. There is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does.   On pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  Do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? The language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. We can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). The  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine havingchoices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. But Dennett is  saying thisis the universal case. If making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. If we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away.  .  On page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. There is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. Discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. Of course there is no mention  here of Wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of Searle's now classic works  on Intention and Social Reality.   He spends much time on  Ainslie's book 'Breakdown of Will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes. Hemakes much of the excellent work of Robert Frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. It was Bingham's idea, amplified by Frank and by Boyd and Richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. He suggests these as examples of Darwinian approaches  that areobligatory and promising. Indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. All that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. He does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice.   Onpg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. But where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! Dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  Again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. As he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the Prisoner's Dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. When the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious,they are much slower and  less reliable. So, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.  Dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. The evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. Our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  If we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.Our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever Dennett thinks can do it.   We can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. These intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. In the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. This is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world.  On pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making(from certain angles)''. He claims that thisplays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  The smoke is thick but I  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. He insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise.   He  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and I doubt he could  do so. Normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, I expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position.   At this point he also starts his discussion of Libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that I felt was worth my time.   On page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  And ``Illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` He says  the trick we need is to see that  ``I`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``Mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''The process of self description... is  what we  are''. The crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  He realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''I know that many  people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. It seems to them  to be a trickwith mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness, and the real Self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' Many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but I would  say it's incoherent and  thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long beforewegot this far.    On pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  This is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'Darwin's Dangerous Idea''!  Presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  He says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'Consciousness Explained to find that there is no answer there either).  Though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. If he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.    We are also told here that R&D(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  I am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  It seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  He continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be OK if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  And then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.   On pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. There is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  I would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead Dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.    He also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. This again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  I know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  We may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). I suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  Another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.    On pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. And on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. Again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. We are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  It is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.    On pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  It's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. On pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  He also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'The Blank Slate').   He often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  This happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   On pg 262 he tries to explain how an ESS(Evolutionarily Stable Strategy) can produce morality. His idea here is that genetic `R&D` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  I would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  Culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.    The last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. He refers to the legal classic by Hart  and  Honore, which I started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by Wittgenstein.  Dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  But, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. There is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. It is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. I find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of Osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. One rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. There is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that Dennett is morally superior. After 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  It seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines.   So, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? It seems  clear(eg, see Pinker's `The Blank Slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. On  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. The moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. But our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect.   How remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  And if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fMRI  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  But a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  And then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  To return to the quote at the beginning--'Ambition is the death of thought'.  Indeed--though clearly Wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts 
 A disappointing rehash of early works on the 1781 Siege of Yorktown.  Half the book deals with the southern campaign of the American Revolution.  The portion of the book dealing with Yorktown strays greatly from the chronological happenings of the siege.  For example, the author starts detailing the story of the assaults on redoubts 9 and 10, which occurred on the night of October 14th.  Before completing the account of the assaults, he jumps to the sortie by the British on the night of October 16th and then after several paragraphs goes back to the assaul on the redoubts.  A better choice for those wanting to read about the siege is Henry P. Johnston's book on the Yorktown Campaign 
 The author writes well and I certainly appreciated that.  However, his spiritual journey seems primarily to emphasize his lack of focus and his ability to see Judaism and Buddhism as "one-size-fits-all" spiritual companions.  I felt that his analogies between the two religious philosophies were stretched rather thin and I was never entirely certain why he felt so strongly that the two must be related or joined together.  I also felt that in several instances, he misrepresented Jewish theological ideas in order to make them fit more neatly into a Buddhist mold.  For example, he tries to relate the Buddhist notions of reincarnation with those of Jewish Kabbalistic mystics.  While there are similarities, he never makes note of the fact that reincarnation is not a particularly strong thread within any of the major denominations of Judaism.  All in all, after reading this book, the phrase, "self-indulgent" keeps coming to mind.  I'm sure it was important for him to write it -- I'm just not convinced that it's important for others to read 
 We received this thermometer as a baby shower gift.  For a few months it worked very well...easy to use.  After about 8 months it started acting strange, giving us inaccurate readings.  The final straw was when the thermometer read 104.8 degrees sending us to the ER at midnight only to find out our son's temperature wasn't even over 100.  The thermometer ended up in the trash can on our way out of the hospital.  
 In comparison to other books available about adobe houses, the content of this book offers little range and depth. Other choices were less superficial 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 When I first skimmed through this book, I thought it would prove to be very helpful.  Unfortunately, although there are some very good suggestions they are overshadowed by poor humor and what many people would consider unacceptable advice.  Although I agree with the author that there are few legitimate reasons for keeping old textbooks (though I am sure, unlike the author, that there are exceptions), I would have to disagree that everyone except football stars and homecoming queens should throw away their high school yearbooks.  Just because it was a "lackluster" experience for her does not mean the rest of us do not genuinely cherish those memories, good and bad.  Not only do I look at mine from time to time, I have actually used it as a reference when trying to remember someone's name, or when a friend has brought up someone from high school, but I can't put a face to the name.  I have read other clutter control books that have had suggestions that are the same or similar to her good ones, but most of those acknowledge keeping mementos, some collections, or other sentimental items, and realize that what fits that description varies from person to person.  I want to live in an organized clutter free home, not a sterilized environment 
 I was disappointed in this book.  While promising low carb and tipping his hat to Dr. Atkins, this book is squarely moderate carb.    There are many internal inconsistencies and inaccuracies in this book.  For example (page 131) "In Western countries, the only[italicized in original]good source of insoluble fiber is the husk of the wheat kernel, called bran."  The Harvard School of Public Health states that insoluble fiber can also be found in seeds.  Flax seed has 3g of fiber per tablespoon, 2 of which is insoluble, and virtually no other carbohydrate.  Wheat bran has only 1.5 grams of fiber per tablespoon and almost another gram of other carbohydrate.  Dr. Thompson is also contradictory in his advice about dietary cholesterol.  He says that dietary cholesterol does not significantly affect blood cholesterol (p.46, p.146).  Yet, when giving dietary advice, he advocates avoiding egg yolks on the same page! (p. 146)  I am concerned by his enthusiastic use of statins as the only means to control blood cholesterol.  He mentions no side effects.  On the other hand, he goes to great pains to point out the potential side effects of aspirin.  If you are looking for a dietary answer, I'd suggest The South Beach Diet by Dr. Agaston as a far superior work 
 Of all the literature I've read concerning the Elijah Muhammad, this is by far the worse. After only two chapters, it becomes obvious that Evanzz developed his analysis of Muhammad and the N.O.I. based upon data presented by the FBI, CIA, New York and Detroit police. Where are the interviews with Muhammad's family, friends, and business associates? Where are the excerpts from any of Muhammad's dozens of books? Where are the accounts from present or former N.O.I. members? Instead this book presents references from government agencies as indisputable fact. Anyone familiar with the clandestine workings of such agencies during the 1950's and '60's (i.e. "CoIntelPro) would surely be suspicious of such "information", and at least attempt to seek out other sources. Evanzz's account fails to make such an attempt and is so one-sided, that it offers the reader no opportunity to intelligently analyze Elijah Muhammad, his organization or those who followed him. This book is closer to "National Enquirer" material, than it is to informative,  responsible journalism. Anyone interested in a well-written, balanced account of Elijah Muhammad and the history of the N.O.I., I recommend "An Original Man" by Claude Andrew Clegg III. It's a brilliant work and far superior to Evanzz slanderous writing. Don't waste your time or money.    
 This man is another example of our over-affluent society's attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good. Deepak Chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided Marin County yuppies. Sleep is important, as is taking care of our bodies and minds, but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this? Basic common sense (drink a lot of water...) is sugar-coated in pseudo-spiritual jargon, insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self-help-junkies and cult-bait. Can't sleep? Use the 17 bucks to buy a real book, and read it in bed. Or buy a vibrator 
 I LOVED The Inferno, so I approached this book with the enthusiasm of a gourmand at an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Sadly, the bread turned out to be stale, the steak overdone and the desserts moldy. Okay. Now that I've run that metaphor into the ground, let's talk about Vita Nuova.  I found it to be pretty darn tedious and highly melodramatic.  The prose is self-indulgent and dry; the poetry, while slightly better, falls into the same camp.  You just want to say to the guy--get a life!  At several points during the book, Dante's fellow townspeople mock him because of his constant waterworks and woe-is-me-ing. I sympathized with them, found myself laughing at this whiny, timid little man.  Dante, as he portrays himself in this book, is a bore, a sniveling, spoiled child.  
 "The Good Mother" begins with recently orphaned children, Abby and Ethan, who are adapted by seemingly nice husband and wife Raymond and Eve living in a fancy house. But of course the two children will find that the couple's nice and kind attitudes hide something else, something that was NOT seen in the previously released "The Glass House," made about five years ago.  I don't spoil your fun of watching "The Good Mother"  another entry of Sony's direct-to-video film, of which story itself, predictable and ridiculous, would not be of much interest to most of you than the (intentionally, I guess) campy acting from the leading lady Angie Harmon as Eve. Her unique character would surely remind you of "Mommy Dearest" if not as intense as Faye Dunaway's now legendary performance. Look how Eve, or a good mother if you like, checks out each item before having dinner with awfully boring husband, saying "Chicken, beans, salad, wine ... perfect." In a scene you can see her actually growling like a tiger. That's hilarious.   If you can ignore the countless plots holes and incredible stupid decisions some characters make, you might find yourself enjoying this B thriller. Surprisingly good is Jordan Hinson as Abby, who deserves a much better script than this. To these two leading ladies go my two stars 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 This was a very unscriptural movie, and a very poor portrayal of King David. It was a waste of time. Professional production work and big name actors do not a good movie make. Maybe Hollywood has its own way of viewing things, but when making a movie of a written text as well known as this one, it is better to stick to what the text says. David did not scrabble on the ground for stones for his sling during the battle with Goliath, he collected them ahead of time. The affair with Bathsheba was at his idea and initiation, not hers. He did NOT have a tantrum when God told him he could not build the temple. Enough said 
 Since I don't normally write reviews, I'll not try to make this clever.  I was completely disappointed in this latest attempt from Vince Flynn.  Though I love the character of Mitch Rapp, in this novel he read like a cardboard cut-out of the Mitch Rapp in all previous books.  As I read, I tried to analyze what was going on: "Well, he just been through a big loss, very traumatic...Flynn is trying to show the audience that Mitch has been profoundly altered by the experience.  Flynn will deal with this head on at some point in the novel".  He never does.  The whole interaction between Kennedy and Rapp at the end of the book feels like it was written by an 7th grader - its out of character and unbelievable for two seasoned intelligence professionals, completely without subtlety.  I've now come to the conclusion that, as a writer, Flynn has lost the hunger (i.e. is too full of himself, now that he's "made it" and has friends in high places).  My husband is a writer, I know the difference between when he's producing junk and when he's in the creative zone, writer coming together with words, not satisied until he's melded creative energy to insight, to produce art.   It appears that Flynn hurried threw this together -- a great disappointment to his fans who have followed Mitch since Term Limits and connected with his ability to read a situation, act decisively and remain in control, objectives intact.  I've already sold this book (though I won't part with the others) and I'll be more careful before I buy Flynn's next offering. My advice to Vince: Remember why you started writing (I'll bet it wasn't to produce books of mediocity).  
 Alex's art is not good. His work is just hyped because it is painted. It just looks horrible , all the characthers look like wax models. The story is woefully basic and there is no characther development of any kind, to me the story was exactly what would put people off superhero comics.  
 I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time.  A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead.  In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein.  Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance 
 hey, it transmits to the FM station that you set it to transmit on BUTTTTT... I live in houston and you need two clear stations for this thing to transmit clearly and there aren't any! THUS ... STATIC ...It's a waste of time if you live anywhere where that are lots of FM stations. HMM.. that'll be all of AMERICA and the world!! 
 If you are looking for a pro socialist (but surprisingly anti-postmodern) and horribly pessimistic view of American society, I recommend this book.  If you like vague generalizations and loosely correlated (but very interesting) facts presented as truth, The Cheating Culture is for you.   Apparently people cheat.  Cheating is a new phenomenon that has swept our nation.  It seems that today, people are cheating on their taxes; corporations are fudging their books, practicing insider trading and misrepresenting themselves.  All of these brand new ideas are sweeping the nation, and now, even the common citizen is cheating.  I know it's hard to believe, but Mr. Callahan told me so.  The past was this beautiful place, where no one ever cheated.  Corporations were beacons of morality and it was rare to see anyone cheat, except for maybe Robin Hood, but that was for the greater good.  This na?ve and somewhat ignorant banter is the idealized notion of the past and horribly generalized version of the present I found presented in Callahan's book.  Corporate lawyers pad their hours therefore secretaries steal more pens.  I am all for random associations, in fact, I thought Freakonomics and The Quark and the Jaguar were both great books.  But where these books differ is in the consideration of controls and variables.  It seems Callahan doesn't believe his hypothesis needs controls and variables.    In my opinion, The Cheating Culture is a weak argument (though perhaps a semi-valid notion) that lacks credibility.  One would think (or he would hope) that the flood of statistical data given in his book would denote some scientific validity (looking at other reviews he succeeded in some cases).  Alas, this book is sans science.  The superlative language Callahan uses (worse, greater, more, etc.) lacks any statistical point of reference to judge whether cheating is indeed worse, greater, etc.  When there is a point of reference given he doesn't account for purchasing power parity or other relevant factors.  I liken his argument to noticing that Americans make more money than they did in the 50's and then concluding that Americans today are rich.  A simple conclusion, and a wrong one.  There is too much pertinent information left out of his argument to consider it credible.    Here are some extremely valid factors that Callahan leaves out: Population growth - there are more people to cheat (per capita) which makes cheating more visible; Information Technology - information is disseminated more, more quickly, and to more people (perhaps we are just more aware of cheating); `Old and Fewer Pressures' - in contrast to Callahan's thoughts, the pressure to cheat is not new at all nor is it greater than ever before, the cost of living is less than it was 20, 30, or 50 years ago, unemployment rates are down from 20, 30, or 50 years ago, and the stakes are incomparable (cheating for survival during the Great Depression vs. cheating to get a BMW, tax write off, or yet another million added onto one's salary); Entrepreneurship - there are 10.5 million self employed Americans, this is a ripe environment to bypass corporate pressures and start your own business.   Again, I am not saying Callahan is completely wrong but that there is insufficient evidence in his book to back up his claims.  Cheating is a real problem that does impact society. There are interesting points in this book, however it is not at all worth reading the entire thing.  
 A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a "key" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's "will" and race as the key to a "kultur's" success.   This is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to National Socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction-- facts be damned.   Interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis. 
 I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it. 
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 This guy is a snake oil salesman. Watch out people.  Open your minds 
 We are compelled to ... copy and paste almost the whole another's reader review, where I found almost all what we are not only thinking but directly first hand KNOWING, not only as "firm believer" rather as working to "collect proofs" and helping direct victims on this field. "To convince me of their point of view by eliciting emotion rather than reason...": how much I think this to be a mighty favour for changing real facts to mere lined up suggestions. "I tend to regard every word that follows with considerable suspicion. I'm querky that way, having learned long ago that emotion is the fastest way to short circuit reason.": thanks Cathy (Oregon, USA) for your words! "Agenda?, October 17, 2001 Reviewer:	Cathy (Oregon, USA) - See all my reviews ...Hey, I'm a firm believer that the U.S. government lies and performs harmful experiments on it's citizens on a regular basis. We have proof of that, lots of it. That said, when some one attempts to convince me of their point of view by eliciting emotion rather than reason, as Mr. Keith does, I tend to regard every word that follows with considerable suspicion. I'm querky that way, having learned long ago that emotion is the fastest way to short circuit reason. Mr. Keith buries us in references and offical sounding partial quotes from important people and important sounding people hoping that we the reader won't notice the constant use of buz words meant to elicit emotion rather than reason. "The Elite", "greed", "world wide conspiracy", the "ruling class", "eminent stuffed shirts". On and on, over and over, emotional buz words meant to illicit the we vs them response, where "we", the reader, are good and "they" are evil. Again, in order to elicit the "oh, my god" from us, he uses phrases such as "may have been a member of", without ever offering any proof of actual membership in this awful organization or "it has been reported", but he never tells us who reported these awful things. This book was especially dissapointing for me, because for the most part I agree with the idea that there are "beings" trying to control our thought. As if our "free press" doesn't do a superb job already. I admit that I finally gave up on this book some where around chapter 10. I'd just had it. I suspect that there are truths to be found here, but I was unable to get past Mr. Keith's style to find any. Maybe you can get past this, obviously from some of the previous reviews, some readers don't even notice it. Me, I'm the suspicious type and this book caused me to think that maybe there is LESS, not MORE with respect to the idea of mind control. 
 I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could).  The author is a snob who  doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself.  If they take their "menial" jobs seriously she looks down on them.  She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement.  For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM. 
 I wish I could review the book but I can't. I have a Mac and can't run the CD. I have totally wasted my money. Almost every nursing book I've bought in the last two years has had a CD and every one of them has worked. I just went back through the description on Amazon and can't find a reference to the fact that you have to be running windows. So if you have a Mac stay away from this book 
 I loathed this book. I despised it. While every eighth grade English teacher in the U.S. may hate that I say this, I'm only telling the truth. There are characters that are so cocky and reading about them made me want to gag. Tom Sawyer as a boy and as a character seemed both annoying as a real human, and unrealistic. Becky, too, was unbelievable. No young children such as those could possibly act like that, and besides, I don't truly believe a boy Tom's age would be so cool in a cave, and rescue his lady-love.  Tom Sawyer and I just didn't get along. It's just one of those things. I suffered through reading it, though perhaps someday I'll try again, and the experience will be better 
 Egan is a good writer, but in this book she does not transport us.  It feels as though she is distracted.  The research leaves a little something to be desired.  Lastly, the book seems to have a need for a brand of drama that fuels the imaginations of 18 year olds. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
 I found the layout and presentation  of the book difficult to follow and could not easily see the principles behind the so called technique. It really didn't seem any different than talk therapy to me 
 This book was a huge disappointment.  It was very basic and very vague.  For example, it would tell you to shape the brow to make their face look longer or shorter, but it wouldn't tell you how to shape the brow in order to do that.  All the pictures were small, in black and white, and it was hard to see any detail.  I kept on reading on, hoping that I was going to get to the good stuff, but the good stuff never came.  I truly felt like I learned nothing and it was supposed to be an instructional book.  A waste of money.  I was debating returning it, but it doesn't seem worth it to go to the post office and have to pay for shipping it back 
 I was unaware this "book" is only 4x5 inches.Kind of defeats the purpose of looking at posters.  Man, what a rip off. The type on some of the "posters" is so small,that you will need a magnifying glass to read what band it is for.   Don't waste your mone 
 When I was a young man, I liked to see Tarzan in the movie. I think it was Less Barker, who played Tarzan. He was the right Tarzan for me. Unfortunately he is not on this DVD. But Gordon Scott, who followed, is on one movie. He is ok. The other Tarzans on this DVD are before my time. Unfortunately is this DVD in black and white and I misordered 2. I hope to find some in colour from 1960-1970.Best regards from Birger Lundsfryd, Denmark 
 I ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest.  Tipler's theory of immortality, in a nutshell, is the following: 1) the planet earth...and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in ~1 billion years. 2) Man will make self-learning and self-replicating machines (can Windows XP do that?) that will colonize, over millions of years, our galaxay and, eventually, the entire universe. 3) These machines will be capable of individual thoughts, emotions, etc and are essentially "alive." 4) As the universe begins to collapse, the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe. 5) All the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one "super being" at the center of the collapsing universe...this super being is the "omega point." 6) The omega point, via its "all knowledge of all things" will be able make emulations (exact duplicates) of all biospheres, including earth.  Within these emulations, individual humans (you and me!) will be emulated.  Thus we will again be "alive" as these "beings" in these emulations will be unable to tell if they're real or virtual....PRESTO...immortality for all.  The book (theory) reeks of circular logic and assumptions.  It's an interesting theory, but it's just that, an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist.  PS: Tipler denies the resurection of Christ and in  the last chapter admits to being an aetheist.  (I wonder if he's a God-fearing aetheist? 
 Well, I decided to give Yoko-Ono a listen after not hearing her music for a while. My conclusion, she basically just got a career off Lennon after he decided it would be fun for her to do so. That's pretty plain and simple. Her vocals are painfully unemotional, dry, and immature for a woman of her age. I don't hate Yoko-Ono as a person, she's obviously just doing what she wants to do. But sadly, she really does not have talent in writing songs or using her voice as an instrument. Its basically bad female-falsetto you'd here flailing around over some instruments in a 3rd grade choir. I don't really understand how you could listen to her music when there is so much more out there that's much more emotional, mature, and beautiful. I'm not here to say I don't like her because she's weird, I'm an avid Bjork fan and of the avant-garde music genre. Ono's music (if you can call it that) is just downright sloppy, careless, and uninteresting. This CD (and Ono herself) are worth skipping over. There are other people who are more deserving for what they do for the music community. Ono is clearly not one of them. She is a business woman. In conclusion, don't buy this 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 This book expects a lot out of students, thereby requiring instructors to work even harder at presenting the material in a meaningful and understandable way.  Unless students have previously had precalculus (including trigonometry), or had a thorough preparation in algebra, this text will be highly confusing and discouraging to most of them.  It is an inadequate preparation for calculus at best, as it completely omits many key concepts that will be necessary for the study of calculus.  This is a well written book for mathematicians, but not for students just grappling to learn this material.  Unfortunately, there are those who are involved with the "Calculus Reform" that believe this "Applied Approach" is the best approach.  If people really wants to learn about applied mathematics, they need not look any further than physics 
 By all rights, this third part of Matthiesson's trilogy should have been the juiciest entry, since Watson tells the details of his bloody story himself.  However, the book proves to be disappointingly pedestrian, with Matthiesson going back and sketching out Watson's early life, "explaining"  how he got to be as hard-hearted as he did, etc.  The linear approach is a  mistake, I think, and a bad one; indeed, in his obsession with local color  and period detail, Matthiessen seems to have forgotten the basic components  of a novel  -- seems to have forgotten, indeed, how to reward readers who  have made their way patiently through almost 1400 pages of material.  A  book where Watson told his story from the time he came to the Everglades to  the end, with the occasional flashback, would have been riveting.  Instead,  we get transcripts of trials, and again, mountains of information to sift  through.  Actually, that's been the problem with the series as a whole: as  much as I find it intermittently interesting, and as well as Matthiessen  can write at times, he's let the details and the chronology overwhelm him  here, swamping the narrative drive and making it all seem very plodding.   His other mistake, I think, is trying to explain Watson's character, more  or less giving reasons for his evil nature.  But evil is most interesting  when it's an enigma.  I don't buy the bland childhood scenes, the awful  father who "makes" Watson into what he is.  Matthiessen should have just  let evil be evil and got on with the story.  I also don't buy Watson's  voice throughout: I keep hearing Matthiessen behind it, blandly filling out  episodes most readers will care very little about.  The most riveting  section of the whole series comes in the second book when we get the 3 or 4  page version of the killing of the Tuckers written out by R.B. Watson.   What a shame that Matthiessen couldn't have matched that kind of intensity  for the conclusion of his monumental saga.  Sadly, much as I love  Matthiessen, I'd advise readers to call it quits after Killing Mr. Watson  (as Matthiessen should have).  It's the best of the lot 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 While there were some interesting bits in this book and it was readable, for the most part it completely undermined the character of Raistlin, contradicts previous books, and is generally annoying 
 I actually could not even complete the book.  I feel that the prose is somewhat circular and felt that the book was disorganized.  However, my main problem was with the writing.  I had a difficult time following the book 
 Incomprehensible. One must be  a phylosopher or well versed in phylosophy to understand the book. I am not 
 Newt and William are going to write a new book.  It will be called an Alternate History of World War II.  In it Germany will win the Battle of the Bulge BUT lose the war.  Their next book will be an Alternate History of the Revolutionary War, in it the Colonies will win.  Then they will together write an Alternate History of the First World War.  In this stirring book, the ALLIES WIN, THE ALLIES WIN. What is the point?  Also read Sidewalk Sam below for a fuller explanation of this lousy book 
 What a shame Leonard Ashley (who has no doubt spent some time looking into  his subject) is unable to string an intelligent sentence together. This  ridiculously pedestrian book demeans the fascinating subject of demonology  through a nauseous trail of sloppy ideas, puerile humour and incongruous,  misplaced anecdotes. A work of zero interest to even the most  unsophisticated of students 
 There are a variety of approaches to starting a Research Business, and this book simply does little justice to providing business-smart content for doing just that. If you want to embark into a research business on your own, this might give you a vision but it will certainly not give you the business smarts you need to really start and manage your new business. Best to look into resources on starting a consulting business and other resources about starting any business.  Best of luck.  - Dissapointe 
 I was looking through a friend's copy, and I've gotta say, the section I read on Disney's supposedly lax safety practices disgusted me.  I work for the Mouse at Disneyland, and NEVER have I EVER in my backstage experience been given a reason to question my safety when I attend Disney as a guest.  Far more damaging was my job in fast food to my desire to eat McDonalds.  If anything, I feel more comfortable now knowing exactly how much care they put into the safety of their guests.  There will be the occasional instance of human error or guest idiocy, but they do a superb job of minimizing them.  For those who take a dim view of Disney's morals, perhaps it's because unsafe rides lead to accidents, which in turn lead to expensive, high-profile lawsuits.  This book, or at least that topic, which was all I could stomach reading, was full of half-truths, misleading statements, and occasionally outright falsehoods.  I personally feel insulted, because I've now been unfairly deemed part of the profit-hungry scum of the earth 
 I hoped I could leave the theatre, but I was hoping it would get better. Here let me put it this way: 3-D sucked Plot sucked Actors sucked Movie sucked PLEASE DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL!!! 
 uh......... no this book had litle to be desired and its just not cool with all them big words i mean come on.  Whats a sherry and what is an  amontdillo i dont even know. loserbook. Go Central High Footbal 
 I bought this for my 5 year old and as another reviewer said....he would have to be double his size for it to fit (he wears a size 5-6)....and the items attached to it keep falling off.  We had to Duct tape it together to fit him because of course I would rather have returned it...but it was his favorite present!!!  It frustrates him a lot so I do not see him sticking with it! 
 Based on the user reviews, I ordered these knives.  The blades are, as advertised, sharp and well designed.  The handles, however, are very thin and poorly shaped. After a few minutes of slicing strawberries, my hand began to cramp. The knives are very lightweight, which can be a problem because you have to provide all the cutting power yourself. This is one of the very few items I have ever returned to Amazon.    
 Sharpen Your Tactics! presents a diagrammed position from 1125 games and studies, each with a tactical device ready to be unleashed. Occasionally the solutions include one or two brief variations. The diagrams are rated in difficulty from one-star (easiest) to four-star (hardest).  The problems are excellent, but the book has major problems and needs revision.  Many of the exercises, perhaps 70% of them, appear in the Convekta chess tactics programs: Chess Tactics for Beginners, Chess Tactics for Intermediate Players, and Chess Tactics Art 3.0. If you use those programs, this book feels redundant.   Just like the Convekta programs, this book splits many combinations into parts. First, they give you a diagram that asks for the final move of, say, a three-move combination. Then, maybe four pages later, they give you a diagram that asks for all three moves of the same combination. Your chances of getting it right are increased from your earlier experience.  I like this touch.   As I was checking the solutions, something seemed amiss, and I started giving them to Fritz.  Over the course of a year, I found 16 clear errors out of about 150 positions checked.  It seems a likely conjecture, then, that perhaps 10% of the alleged solutions are flawed.  I am talking about very serious flaws, too, where the defending side can hold against the recommended moves.  Rechecking the solutions on Fritz is a ton of work.  We should not have to do it. The publisher and authors should computer-check everything and issue a revised edition.   I purchased Sharpen Your Tactics! two years ago, and it is falling apart. The cover is off and many pages have come loose.  I hold the book together with rubber bands. (Apparently the success of Reinfeld has given publishers the evil idea that an exercise book sells more copies if it falls apart.)  The paper is cheap, the diagrams fuzzy.  It is hard on the eyes.   Aside from a brief introduction, Sharpen Your Tactics! has no words.  In contrast, Alburt (Chess Tactics for the Tournament Player) gives nice definitions of diversion, decoy, skewer, etc., and comments on the solutions.  Moreover, John Nunn, in Nunn's Puzzle Book, gives you verbal setups, hints, and crystal-clear explanations of every solution. Regrettably, Sharpen Your Tactics! gives no verbal explanations of anything.  This silence diminishes the value of the exercises.  Many times I could not understand why the tactic worked until I set it up on Fritz and played through some side variations.  This takes time and effort and should have been included in the price of the book.  The best thing about Sharpen Your Tactics! is its selections: these examples are remarkably similar to what we see in tournament games. This makes it different from Reinfeld, for example, who gives many "beginner positions" where one side has all his pieces developed and the other side has made only pawn moves, producing at best a patzer's wizardry useful only against the neighbor who learned how the pieces move last Tuesday. Most of the positions in Sharpen Your Tactics! are from actual tournament games between titled players. The remaining positions are well-selected studies that have obvious practical application.  Furthermore, the progression of problems is extraordinarily well thought-out.  With helpful sequencing, the exercises steadily deepen your handling of the pieces, as you learn step-by-step how knights on outpost squares so easily generate forks, how rooks on the seventh rank threaten everything, how queens become monsters when they are centralized, and even how tactics help you win a variety of practical endgames.  When you do such a fine sequence of problems, you feel as if you are not simply learning tactics but actually taking a chess course.  In light of how similar the selections are to the Convekta programs, one wonders if they are both borrowed from some standard work available in Russian.  Although the problems have no labels by topic, you can deduce a series of topics: near the beginning you go through winning a queen, then winning a rook, winning a knight, winning a bishop, and finally winning a pawn.  Then you go through knight checkmates, bishop checkmates, rook checkmates, queen checkmates, and pawn checkmates.  Next you get a set of drawing combinations.  Then you get a series of the best combinations of each year starting from about 1860 and continuing to the late twentieth century.  Then you get a number of attacks on the uncastled king, then attacks on the queenside castled position, then attacks on the kingside castled position.  The book concludes with many problems where you sacrifice material to destroy the pawn protection around the enemy king and deliver checkmate.  That same progression of topics, with many of the same positions, appears in the Convekta programs Chess Tactics for Beginners, Chess Tactics for Intermediate Players, Chess Tactics Art 3.0.  Yet in Sharpen Your Tactics! these topics go unlabeled, perhaps because it is cheaper to produce the book that way.  With its poor binding, its unchecked solutions, its cheap paper, etc., this book virtually screams out, "We made it on the cheap!"  In sum, Sharpen Your Tactics! has outstanding selections, but nothing is explained, the pages fall out of the book, the diagrams are unclear, the paper is cheap, the themes are unlabeled, and about 10% of the "solutions" are wrong.  To judge Sharpen Your Tactics! in perspective, we might compare it to perhaps the best tactics exercise book available in English: NUNN'S PUZZLE BOOK from Gambit, the only chess publisher run entirely by Grandmasters.  It also has good selections, but every solution is clearly explained, its binding is strong and attractive, its paper is high-quality, its print and diagrams are crystal-clear, and its solutions are computer-checked.  Nunn's Puzzle Book sets a high standard that Sharpen Your Tactics! fails to meet.  So may we respectfully suggest a revised edition of Sharpen Your Tactics!  Let us see computer-checked solutions, a strong and attractive binding, higher-quality paper, clearer print and diagrams, and explanations of the solutions.  These welcome improvements would bring Sharpen Your Tactics! up to standard, making it a truly superb tactics exercise book 
 The fantasy story in this book is delightful, as are the illustrations.  However, the book repeatedly shows a baby riding on a dog. There is no way I'm going to give the idea of riding a dog to my 2-year-old, especially because we have a dog in our household. This book would be better suited for older children who are able to recognize the difference between real and pretend 
 Hey folks! Do you want to avoid eternal damnation in the foulest depths of Hell? Would you like to guarantee yourself a spot in Heaven? Well then, there's no better way to reach the highest level of spiritual enlightenment than to follow the steps of Mr. Robertson himself! And thus, without further adieu:  1. Invest $8 million dollars into a gold mine in Liberia. Then lie about it, stating that the mine was established to help pay for humanitarian and evangelical efforts in Liberia, when in fact the company was allowed to fail leaving many debts both in Liberia and in the international mining service sector.   2. Enrol in the armed forces during the Korean War, and then proceed to consort with various prostitutes, while also hassling local Korean women. If there's even the remotest chance of you actually being sent to the front line with the rest of the bottomfeeding rabble, get your father to pay off the higher-ups to allow you to remain safely tucked away behind the fighting.   3. Blame feminists, abortionists, pagans, and homosexuals for any tragedy which befalls America, including 9/11. Then, when there's an uproar, kindly mention that your comments were taken out of context (you may also blame it on a faulty television monitor if you'd like).  4. Use your great personal wealth to aid the needy in Rwanda. Generously donate $1.2 million dollars to bring in heavy equipment to assist in your diamond mining operation. After all, who would give money away without the slightest chance of a return investment?   5. Kindly suggest that the explosion of a nuclear weapon at State Department Headquarters would be beneficial to the country. Nothing too serious though, just a "small nuke" in Washington DC to kill a few unworthy scumbags.   6. Claim to be pro-life, but then also support China's one child policy, which is regulated by forced abortions. When asked for the reason, simply state "you gotta do what you gotta do!" Then, some time later, state that you personally don't agree with the practice.   And people are actually worried about salvation! Just follow these easy steps, and in no time you'll become a filthy, disgusting, greedy degenerate like Pat Robertson himself. 
 This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory.  I found "French in 10 Minutes a Day" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook 
 I WOULDN'T KNOW I NEVER GOT MY CD AND ITS BEEN OVER TWO MONTH 
 The book is in black and white print on cheap paper, images are small and low quality, it's almost only text, text, text. The info might be good, but the PATTERNS aren't. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$ 
 When I first learned about this book, I was more than excited that someone had finally written book about high school hockey. I had already read the great accounts of high school sports in Friday Night Lights, and In These Girls, Hope Is A Muscle. Thirty pages into the book, I was more than impressed with the author's beautiful descriptions of Methuen, hockey, and his growing up in this area of New England.  Suddenly, things began to change, as I was now embedded in the author's autobiography of his past hockey and athletic exploits! He makes a very clear statement in the beginning that he doesn't want to be back in his high school years, but simply remember them. Oh, he does remember everthing and anything, and certainly lets the reader know of his dauntless exploits. Who really cares how many goals he scored on a frozen pond playing against a bunch of kids, or popping in nine goals in a pickup game with a senior group pretty much out of shape, or being one of the three stars in the annual JV intersquad scrimmage! Give me a break.   Atkinson managed to work his way into his old high school with the pretense of collecting background for his book. What he did was to live vicariously through this new Ranger team and maybe better his own team record of 5-15-1. He committed the inexcusable error of a writer; allowing your own life to intermingle and become part of what you were trying to write about.  As for the team, too bad Atkinson created an almost Neanderthal mentality and impression of these boys. The naive reader might think this is what hockey is all about, but what a terrible injustice to a group of athletes. As for the coaches, between the locker room expletives, bench outbursts during games, and the pre-game talks about "mating sperm whales" with your female goalie standing in the doorway, I feel this is a reasonable estimate of inappropiate juvenile behavior and thinking with some of the Methuen coaching staff.   At the end, as I struggled to finish his "memoirs," I had to laugh at his mention that he didn't feel quite the same and welcomed going back to Methuen High School after his year. They were probably happy he was finally gone. Typical of "volunteer" coaches or staff, their impression of what they are doing and accomplishing is usually far from reality. The author may have felt he was imparting "words of wisdom," and valuable pieces of experience to members of the team, but Mr. Bobb you really missed the target here. A sixteen, seventeen year-old boy barely hears the words of his parents, much less his teachers, and certainly nothing from a 42 year-old "want-to-be."  If you know anything about high school sports, and/or hockey, save yourself from this self-indulging book. Oh, by the way, why can I be so critical? I have just finished my 34th season coaching high school hockey, ninety-percent of it as a head varsity coach. Along with this, twenty-five years as a head varsity coach in two female sports, and thirty-six years as a high school classroom teacher have all allowed me to see just about everything. In my career, the players and teams of the past are in the books. Next season, all the pages start to be written again. 
 I bought this book and opened it thinking that it wil be the strong version of The Animator Survival Kit, then after just 5 minutes I realized that it was a serial loose of my money because it not worth the money I paid. It has nothing that helps you to animate , is just the story of some Disney old animated movies. And the rest of it is to read a full scale of bla, bla, bla, bla that don't help in anything. But if you are a collector of Disney old stories it will be ok, so before buy it just think if you wanna draw to animate or just collect a big & heavy book with a Disney name on it 
 I find "Overcoming Depression" an uninspiring read. It feels too flabby. And like another book I've read in this series (the Melanie Fennell), it can sometimes come across as fairly trite. Here are some examples: "Don't worry about not getting enough sleep. Margaret Thatcher only slept for four hours a day!" So that's alright then. "A milky drink before bed may help." And yet it may not: is this cold or warm milk we're talking about here? don't some kinds of milk actually stimulate the brain? "Also don't catnap during the day. If I sleep for longer than fifteen minutes during the afternoon, this can really mess up my night's sleep." First he says don't catnap, then he says he does catnap, then he doesn't give any advice on how to avoid catnapping which is surely the essential bit. This might seem like nitpicking but these sample quotes are just from a couple of pages, and turning the page I see we have the following howler on antidepressant drugs: "Many people worry that these drugs are addictive, but they are not." Not a word about the major issue of withdrawal symptoms, something which can occur even when the drugs haven't worked. The later chapter on drugs is also silent on the matter. Maybe this is all straightened out in the American edition, or the revised edition (I admit I got hold of the English edition from 2000). It needs to be. As it stands it feels at best uninformed and at worst irresponsible - a book about depression written by someone who doesn't appear to know about antidepressants, not good is it."Overcoming Depression" could simply do with a going over by a semi-intelligent editor's red pen. It's a shame really, because cognitive behavioral therapy is such a gold mine. Hence the two stars - it's not worthless, just not very well written. Self-help books can be intelligent, informative, *and* feature inspired and interesting writing. Check out "Essential Help for your Nerves" by Dr Claire Weekes. If you have nervous fatigue, or want to overcome stress, fear, panic attacks, you couldn't do better. It just feels as if it's written by someone who's not copying out of the manual, who writes as if they're setting down their life's work, who writes advice in an interesting and unpatronising way that will stay with you, that you'll remember - which is the point really. Mind you, she mentions the milk thing too 
 This CD was a disappointer for me.  I understand that digweed is a sort of pioneer for music with progressive house with no real climax.  I listened to the whole CD as soon I recieved it.  The only thing that I can say that I liked about it was the transition between each song.  That element is very smooth and enjoyable, however, the songs itself are horrible.  There are a few songs in here that I probably wouldn't even consider music because their is no rhythm.  It is more like a beat with obnoxious sounds playing with no smoothness.  I actually couldn't listen to a few songs for the simple fact that it was very annoying.  I had read good reviews so I decided to purchase, but only really liked 2 or 3 of the songs on this disc.  If your a diehard fan of slow, continous music of this sort, you may like it.  But if your not, you will be severely disappointed.  The only way to enjoy this is if your on drugs, and if that's the case, it's not good music.  I'm glad I bought it used 
 These are NOT RAY BANS! They should not come up when I do a search for Ray bans. Get your cheap CRAP out of my search for GENUINE Ray Bans 
 I don't own this gear bag, and I'm not going to buy it even though it looks interesting.  Would this be a suitable carry-on bag, or would I have to check it?  I don't know.  The dimensions are not given anywhere.  I want to know more about the products I order 
 There are just too many outside writers involved with this project.."Side by Side" and "Fall In Love With Me" are the only songs that have any staying power..I think the band could have used a little more time off to regroup after "Raise&quot 
 When I first bought this phone about six months ago, I thought I was getting a good deal, but I was wrong. The phone picked up a lot of static and the battery has a very short life, only a couple hours off the charger then it won't work 
 This is the book that has gathered together all the most annoying people in science studies -- especially the ones who flog the dead horse of 'practise'without considering the larger social and political contexts that have made the Science Wars such a hot issue. I would advise so-called Science Warriors looking for an easy target to look no further than this arboreal sacrifice. Everyone else: check out David Hess's introduction to science studies for something more reasonable and Steve Fuller's book on Kuhn for something really challenging 
 Well the arm rests will not stay in their holsters.. they flop around so you cannot get maximum impact from the machine.  i am totaly disappointed with this machine 
 I thought this book lacked focus and detail. Its basically a collection of thoughts from a number of so called "Pros" who use various methods and comment on what I consider to be the basics. I didn't buy it looking for handicapping advice(which is fortunate it has none)but I did expect some detail about wagering based on the books title. Instead it is a bunch of philisophical ramblings from a few well known handicappers and some who chose not to be identified. You'll laugh,(not really) you'll cry, you'll kiss 20 bucks goodbye. I can't reccomend it 
 I thought that this book was pretty awful. Its coverage was superficial and obtuse at best. The author seemed to have very little understanding of rural life and even less comprehension of the sources of Agrarian protest. Her chapter on Populism was filled with factual errors and was just plain wrong 
 I picked up this book after reading about it on the Simple Living network, which I found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and their work "Your Money or Your Life".  Unlike Mr. Dominguez and Ms. Robin, who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living, Ms. Andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism.  After reading Dominguez, this book is disjointed, preachy and quite frankly, bad. That's not so say that Ms. Andrews doesn't have some good ideas.  She does, but as with so many anecdotal books, they're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way.  If you live an environmentally sensitive life, Ms. Andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself, but if  your goal is to simplify your life, you could do better than spending time on this book 
 A story told first time can be fasicnating. As Rocket Boys was. The same story told second time is just boring. The first one had a backbone: boys trying to achieve the goal despite the circumstances. The second one - ranomly selected stories about this or that - I simply don't care. Meaningless and borin 
 I got this as a gift and if it wasn't alreay opened, I would have returned it. Theres nothing new or novel about the humor in the series. Its the same old tired race jokes throughout 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 I ordered this book having loved some other for dummies books.  Thank goodness I ordered several other saltwater tank books.  As I was picking through each of them I noticed that the for Dummies book contained information that completely contradicted the others!  I was so angry at the wrong information in this book that I sent it back at a $5.00 loss.  I'm actually considering checking some of my other for dummies books for errors.  Yes, the language is simpler than in other books, but the amount of wrong information is not worth the cost of the book.  Buy this if you want to kill some fish 
 This magazine is just page after page of Hollywood P.R. agencies releases. Unbelievable. Why didn't I think of it? I know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources, but other than a few pages of VERY subjective movie/music/book reviews, this magazine just re-writes and prints Hollywood press release after Hollywood press release again and again and again. This magazine must not have a staff of writers, but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes. The funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by, say, Tom Cruise's management company/major film studio/hired PR flak fawning over Cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever, sassy, wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks. Uh, okay - wait, didn't you get the press release? If you Tivo EXTRA and have the theme to Entertainment Tonight as your ringtone, this magazine is right up your alley. Otherwise, don't waste a penny on this nonsense.   
 I can't beleive the amount of good reviews of this CD.  I have most of the Pat Metheny library and this CD is the worst by far.  It was like listening to all of his un-inspired, not-as-good, filler songs in one sitting.  Yuck!  Don't get me wrong, I love Pat Metheny's work, but this CD was just BAD 
 I first read this book attending a School of Evangelism, and thought it was a great book.  At the time I didn't know how to read. 
 This is without a doubt the worst piece of social science ever produced. Regardless of where you stand politically, Johnson is guilty of revisionist history to the worst degree. Throughout this work Johnson displays a truly and utterly amazing ignorance of geopolitical realities. 
 This book is a "horrid example".  The author and Martina Navratilova were, for a time, a very public couple. Then they broke up. And Brown made the fatal error of writing a roman-à-clef. This is always a mistake. Getting revenge on your ex is death on good writing. It's a shame, because Brown is ordinarily an excellent writer. 
 Why New Orleans Matters is a short, small format book that attempts to make a case for why the New Orleans that was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in September 2005, should somehow be restored to author Tom Piazza's vision of the city.  The bulk of the book recounts places, events, customs and people that made Piazza's hometown of 11 years so special for him.  What he describes will be familiar to anyone whose knowledge of New Orleans extends beyond what is covered in a Gray Line tour.  Writing just weeks after Katrina blew away it was too soon to correct, so Piazza repeats, false or overblown media stories that  proved to be false.  Piazza's life, house and possessions were as ruined as the city he loves and he recounts a brief trip to salvage his and a friend's remnant belongings.  He correctly, appropriately and too briefly describes it and grieves for that loss.  That's the book's second theme.  The third theme is Piazza's demand that New Orleans be magically rebuilt to recreate the rare habitat he believes will draw back musicians, street dancers, workers and the underclass whose fragile spirit animates the true (i.e., Piazza's version of) New Orleans.  Unfortunately Piazza does not provide a single specific idea as to how this can be done.  But he clearly tells us it can NOT be done by property development types.  So who does Piazza think is up to the task?  Would it be the same local and state officials who, along with federal agencies failed the city before, during and after Katrina hit?  Piazza better hope so because New Orleans' mayor during the hurricane,  Ray Nagin, was elected to another term in office after this book was written.  In his introduction Piazza asserts that New Orleans "inspires the kind of love very few other cities do.  Paris, maybe Venice, maybe San Francisco, New York... the list is not much longer."  While overlooking Piazza's Western Eurocentric view as to what kinds of cities inspire love among the world's inhabitants, somebody should tell Piazza that dozens of well-loved cities have essentially vanished without a trace throughout history, although their residents' unique spirits didn't necessarily die.  Likewise, New Orleans' spirit will animate other cities just as people who initially came from Africa, Greece, Italy, the Middle East, France, Spain and England, Ireland and elsewhere brought the spirit of those places and combined them to create New Orleans at the particular moment Piazza stumbled into the mix and pronounced it "good".  Already some New Orleans musicians are putting roots down elsewhere - several reportedly decided to stay, of all places, in Portland, OR - and no doubt writers, artists and other creative souls are doing the same.  And many of its disbursed former residents are discovering that the price they paid for New Orleans' colorful folk life was enduring schools, police, government services and economic opportunities that were far inferior to those available to them in other American cities.  Tom Piazza needs to wake up and smell the beignets.  Old New Orleans is forever gone.  New New Orleans will arise.  Le bon temps roulette 
 mildly humorous, yet nearly completely devoid of useful information.  imaginative language: keep a dictionary on hand.  look here if seeking a few good laughs from a couple of witty fellas, dont if pursuing applicable advice 
 Did you notice that Jennifer Smith has written reviews for several of the scholarship books at  amazon.  Apparently she is a fake.  She probably works for amazon 
 This book does a great job of paralleling basic business concepts with Monopoly game play.  This would work perfectly if business was conducted by four persons in your living room.    The book covers concepts including aggressiion, opportunity, maximizing odds and negotiation.  If you find these concepts new or intriguing then this is a great book for you.  I found it somewhat humorous and witty but not enough to recommend to friends.   I do find myself oddly excited about my next game of Monopoly as I now have some insights on game strategy that I never knew or cared about before 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 While she has a lot of good information (the list of contacts at the end are great), as a Catholic-Christian, married-father adopting from Guatemala, I did not like the single-mother, pro-homosexual slant of the book. It is NOT a handbook of how to adopt internationally. It is her story of adopting a girl from China. In writing the book, she talked to a lot of people who adopted from all over the world. Their stories are spread throughout the book and add a lot to the book. Overall, I was disappointed with the book and would not recommend its purchase 
 I have tried three of these MyBooks and each one has the same problem...file errors.  The problem is it turns on and off by itself and if you leave it on and then decide to copy files over it will copy the files and then won't allow you access to them!  It is a real piece of garbage.  Western Digital should be sued over this useless, hack of an external hard drive.  Don't trust your data to this because you will be sorry 
 This book is superficial, gossipy with little insight other than ain't folk strange. Try Love's Executioner by Irvin Yalom for contrast  with ease and pleasure of readin 
 I watched this film as part of my history studies in Post-War Europe and before everyone docks me because I gave it two stars, hear me out.  I'm no Godard fan so I may not be able to appreciate this film as a fan of The New Wave might.  I'm just your regular Joe Movie-Watcher.  Masculin Feminin is about Paul, a 21-year-old French citizen that just retired from his 16 months in the Army.  Paul is a believer in Marxism and throughout the film promotes the Worker's Party while denouncing US involvement in Vietnam, the Du Gaulle government and most forms of Westernism such as condoms, psychadelic rock (many songs in Masculin Feminin have a style similar to The Kinks, Jefferson Airplane etc) and even Coca-Cola... yet Paul is often seen playing pinball and that mini-bowling game you see at an arcade.  Paul seems to be the pro-French identity kind of guy as he often eats cheese and drinks wine.  The preserver of the romanticized French culture.    However, Paul's friends and interviewees (Paul works for the IFOP, the major French polling agency at the time) seem to not care about the change towards a quasi-American consumer state.  Paul's girlfriend Madelein is a rising pop-singer, her room mates are materialistic consumers, one who owns a car, and the people Paul interviews seem to only care about themselves.  This is very accurate in terms of how the 'baby-boom' generation of French youth began to rebel against the traditionalist governments in Europe.  Like the teens in the 1950s in the US, the teens began to form their own demographic.  However, this is where my fascination ends.  Godard apparently never heard of music editing and film editing.  In many parts in the movie, Godard fixed the camera on one person's face in a portrait shot and kept it there for minutes at a time even though the scene was a 15-minute back and forth conversation.  The volume in the music went from very high to very low instantly in many parts during dialogue, making it very annoying if almost distracting to the audience.    In a few parts when Paul was whistling, the recording of the whistling obviously overloaded the sound buffer as I heard static in the speakers.  I thought this was a volume problem on my end so I turned it down, nope... it was the sound editing.  This is just poor recording and editing.  Furthermore, the sound editors had this fascination with using the same gun-noise sound (which sounded more like a cartoon car noise) over and over and over again and in very unlikely times.    Other times, ambiant noises would drown out the dialogue such as vehicles from outside a cafe or even drinking noises.  Sometimes the sound didn't kick in for up to five seconds into the scene.    Because this is a French New Wave film, I won't attack how there is virtually no plot and has random scenes that are just plain silly.  However, I strongly recomend not getting this film if you're just in the general audience and not a New Wave fan.  Otherwise, you might like this New Wave classic but I'm no expert on the subject.  I was just extremely disapointed with the lazy filming, recording and editing.  
 Podhoretz, the man who recently said what's the big deal about a few thousand dead G.I.'s in Iraq considering what's at stake (without having a clue that nothing is at stake), Norman disparages the artist/intellectual/egotists of the 60's/70's that don't fall in line with his ideology while today he lauds the conservative egomaniacs that have brought our country to its low level of intellectualism and turned a nation founded by intellectual deists into a Disneyworld of McReligion.  But it's all fine so long as we make the world safe for democracy.  Norman seems to think there is something hypocritical about professing social justice and being a small time celebrity, when in fact, as Freud said, the partial motivation of any "artist" is fame and the love of women (speaking I assume of male artists). Einstein enjoyed the limelight; everyone enjoys the limelight and everyone has his or her weaknesses.  Have you ever read Einstein's poetry?  YUK!  So to disparage the ones you don't happen to like is a bit disingenuous.  The true irony is that only an attention-seeking egotist would write a book about such trivial nonsense.  But this is all in keeping with a man who explains what writers should be writing if they only knew better, ex., he applauded James Baldwin's early career because he was on his way to being another Henry James; he condemns him when Baldwin's attention turned to racism in America.  Imagine that: a black writer distraught over racism in America.  The very idea! I think Norm's whole problem can be traced back to his youth, which he relates in his autobiography "Making It," talking about taking the subway from culturally challenged Brooklyn to Manhattan, growing up as a nice Jewish boy, the son of modest working class parents, attending college, and rising among the ranks of the intellectual New York crowd. Nowadays, Norm is comparing the invasion of Iraq to the invasion of Normandy, and explains that Iraq will become democratic by using as an analogy post-WW II  Germany's quick transition to a modern democracy (of course, with the help of 2 1/2 million allied troops occupying it).  How did this guy ever have friends to begin with?? 
 I can actually understand Morvan's character better given the 14th century backdrop of this novel. However, Anna sounded more like a 21st century feminist to me. She did not sound very genuine for a woman in that period. I wish Madeline had never written this book, given that this is the only one of her 11 novels (if I remember the number correctly) that I had to put down before reaching the end. I just could not take the characters, mainly Anna. However, I loved to see David drop by :)..   Rags 
 I thought this book was going to be sooo great! I love Hake and that back sounded awsome. The character,Ruth, in the begining even sounded so intreseting but then it was so boring. It just died in the middle. Even before the middle. Why was there so much on secondary characters when there was absolutly no point. There was no spark between the two main characters by the time the ended up together i was so bored with them. Josh had like no emotions either. he was so even on one line it was wierd! If i'd known it was going to be soo flat I wouldnt have bothered, read Measure of a Lady much more Intresting 
 Seriously friends...I was watching a youthful EJ on the ACL DVD and he just blew my mind, lick after lick but let's be real...Bloom is a repeat of the same old thing except not as good as it used to be.    EJ, take it from one of your biggest fans who owns all of your music...if you come out with another album, don't use samples because you think that they will help you modernize the music or "relate" to the kids.  Go into the woodshed and seriously, build a chair.  You need to practice and learn something new if you're going to do something original ever again.  Otherwise, each and every album that you put out is going to sound the same as old ones...like this one does.    Still, much respect.  You are a great master of the instrument but, PRACTICE 
 I don't think I've ever read a book as blind to its subject matter as "Race-ing Toward A White Future".  Bernardi misinterprets many of the episodes, taking certain scenes and characters way out of context, and  ignores the vast majority of scripts that would counteract his hyper-PC  argument.  I found myself disagreeing with him in almost every paragraph.   For example, Bernardi seems to think that every use of the color black in  Star Trek and other Sci-Fi shows and movies is an automatically racist  gesture (!); this is a paranoid, ignorant and ridiculous assumption. And  just when it seems like he's about to make a valid point about a particular  episode or scene, he takes it too far by making grandiose statements which  have no basis in reality.  AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS.  It is poorly  written, narrowminded in focus and misinterpretative of Star Trek's  position on race 
 Tedious and inane come to mind. It is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a "catty" pseudo-feminist style, rambling descriptions of Egyptian archaeology - real or imagined - thinly veiled racist comments about the "ignorant natives" of Egypt and inept sexual innuendo. The book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced. The characters do not come across as real.  Very disappointing. Leave this one on the library shelf 
 This book looks big and impressive on the outside, but inside, it is of very little use to the average commercial mural artist.  I was very disappointed, especially considering the hefty price tag.  Would not recommend 
 The turnaround to receive the product is horrible! Product was ordered before Christmas and wasn't received until end of January 
 I haven't bought or read the book.(I read Trends which I found to have no detail or market research-just cute man bashing).  What I challenge anyone who has read this book is give me 10 discreet things (ok 3) that the author gives you to help market to women. I mean take back to the office and put to use things. I don't mean 'women want complexity' - more than that. What do we mean by 'complexity'? Or how do we create an online  experience for a woman that increases click-thru to purchase.  Do we upsell items on the first page (because that is how women prefer it)? Do we put shoes next to the business suits because women multi-task?  Or??... you get the point. My take is most of her material is anecdotal- even personal opinion. I may be wrong - someone help me on this. 
 I have only read the Neon Genesis Evangelion section (for a paper). From what I've read, it seems to me that Redmond makes provacative assertions that are annoyingly lacking in evidence. The Evangelion chapters largely consist of episode summaries, the majority of which has nothing to do with his thesis (that Evangelion is an allegory for East Asian regionalism). Redmond occasionally throws in generic terms such as "Asiazilla" and "East Asian subjectivity" to maintain a link to his thesis, but his weak analysis and sparse evidence on them only confused me. A book worth a glance only for its brevity and originality, as there isn't much literature that closely examines anime in the scope of East Asian regionalism.      
 I have not been able to find a replacement for my 2-fold nylon wallet by Rolf's. Based on the good review this wallet has got, I went ahead with my oder.  It turns out that the wallet I just received lacks a secured compartment for storing dollar bills. This is because one end of this comparment is entirely open and the compartment for the dollar bills is secured only when the entire wallet is folded.  I fail to appreciate how this product can even be called a wallet when there is no secured compartment for bills. Granted, commados may never need to carry dollar bills or they are trained with special skills to secure them in this product. In all fairness, it would be good for the seller to fully disclose this particular feature and let the fully informed buyers  decide if this product fits their needs. 
 The title of this product is a joke.  It should be called "Not Easy CD burning".  Roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is.  It is way too complicated for burning simple CDs 
 I was forced to read this in high school and it was awful.  The characters behave idiotically as if they have no common sense.  Liberals including my literature teacher love this book because of of the pro-communist and "blame the white man" views.  I'm not white, and I still found it impossible to relate to Bigger.  Young adults would enjoy books more if they weren't forced to read bad novels like this 
 I really can't imagine what might have encouraged those reviews above.  I found it exhausting to get through this--not particularly because the anecdotes O'Brien tells are boring but instead because O'Brien's tone itself is so off-putting, so agonizingly pretentious, that it actually ends up ruining what I think could be a very fascinating read.  I can't recommend this book.  Sorry 
 In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.  If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.  The first chapter is written in a maudlin, "those-were-the-good-old-days" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say "Erin Go Braugh" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.  Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as "It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism," or "they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism." These "Morris mind-reads" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.  Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!  But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.  Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.  Benjamin Franklin said "Statistics is a liar." Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.  Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in "Moby Dick," we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: "I caught a fish this big!"  There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.  In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!        
 i never even got this book because apparently its not a book yet amazons web site said it was. it took me 4 phone calls with 4 different customer service reps for some one to figure that out. all they gave me for the inconvenance was a 15 dollar amazon gift card which i tryed to use and doesn't work. i still don't have the book i needed and it is 4 weeks into the semester. i have baought other things from amazon and gotten them but this expeirance makes me never want to use amazon again. i would like to give you a review of the actual book but i never recieved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I'm a Tami Hoag fan, but this book was weak at best.  The plot was predictable; the characters stereotypical and 2 dimensional.  The reparte between the characters was overly witty and contrived.  Hoag is definitely capable of a more intricate plot and better writing.  
 I was enjoying this book for the first sixty-seventy pages until I read Mr. Lengel's description of Ft. Ticonderoga. He places the Fort on the Hudson River. (????) Ft. Ticonderoga, so important a location in the French/Indian and Revolutionary wars is, in fact, on Lake Champlain. Mr. Lengel also incorrectly writes that Henry Knox, after retrieving the cannons from Ft. Ticonderoga takes them down the Hudson. This too is incorrect. Knox and his men took the cannons across land to Lake George (which was frozen in winter), down to Lake George village and south to Albany before turning east to Boston. I'm totally shocked that no review of this book mentions these inaccurate statements. Anyway, after about 100 pages I took the book back to the library. I couldn't depend on the rest of his facts-so what's the point of reading it? 
 Found this novel very trite and the lead character too overblown and shrill. Also as another reviewer said - what is with Jerry Mather's being gay???  I am sure that he is NOT.  Loaded with errors and mis-spellings.  I could not understand why the lead character did not want to be around her family.  Her mother did not seem like a bad person so I did not think that this was developed at all.  This novel could have been alot better and I am not going to read any of her other books.  Too many good southern writers to read instead of reading Ms. Smith's. Read Cathy Holton's novel instead - wonderful southern women's novel 
 Nothing much new or of substance here.  I sent it back and ate the postage 
 I'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and I can't decide among the following:      * Travels Through Guilt with the World's 33rd Richest Hippie     * The Mind of an Empty Suit     * A Self-Important Revisionist History     * How I Learned to Hate Myself and Love the Third World     * Memoirs of a Cold War Paperpusher  Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the Cold War by a man who had no stake in his own ambition.  The first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world, when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry. If you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy, then the moral outrage of this book makes sense. But there's a whole lot to swallow.  On the plus side, it's a fast and somewhat entertaining read. Otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface.  One of the things that I've had in mind as I was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny. As I look at the 20th Century, I think of most of it focused on the economics of . Perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation. He falls in love with Socialist charismatics in Latin America, rues the lives of poor peasants, and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism.  Perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist. a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric. But you can't imagine that he even had the temerity to read Marx, Weber, Engles, Friere or anyone. Back when I was a bit more blackified, I referred to such people as culture vultures. If it's indigenous, it's good. But you'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics, literacy rates, crime rates or even inflation.  I discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the World Bank except that he saw it as evil. Technically, you'll get a great deal more insight reading Wikipedia. Basically, Perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet, his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the CIA and NSA and that this is, was and always will be the American way. You really get a foggy view of the Evil Empire of America from Perkins, who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game. It's a confession all right.  By the time I got 2/3rds of the way through, reading the book began to become annoying. The incredible vacuity of this man was staggering. There are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of. He found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning. It is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory.  We learn that he took one of his charges (female) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the Caribbean, but that when he got there, he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees.  If you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance, the best book I've read is My Life as a Quant. If you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy, the best book to read is Larry Kolb's Overworld. If you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the Cold War era, then this is your book. But it's nowhere near as good as, say The Quiet American.  You can imagine that Perkins, who is a great admirer of Graham Greene, might have had aspirations to be such a character as Greene might pen. He is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus, but he is to honest to consider himself heroic, and I suspect that he'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life. In that regard, 'Confessions of an Economic Hitman' is (now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition) a blueprint for American liberal guilt. If there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom America to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown, it is John Perkins. He has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic American, down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of Thomas Paine. You'd think, being a pseudo-economist, that he'd have some room in his heart for Alexander Hamilton. Ahh but that would mean that he'd have to admire courage.  I didn't want to be a harsh judge of Perkins. I thought I might learn of an extraordinary life, one of conviction and then epiphany. Instead I learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through.  Someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that 'corporatocray' is evil. This book has been a disappointment in many ways. I may well be very happy to read Thomas Friedman after this.  Good parts?  Yeah there are a few. He speaks about a few South American presidents who might have been contenders. He gives a few details about Saudi Aramco. But compared to Larry Kolb's fascinating and detailed portraits of Daniel Ortega and Adnan Khashoggi, this is Romper Room. If Perkins thought he was an agent... don't make me laugh 
 Seriously: the sound is the worst I have encountered on any DVD release, a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles - there is a lot of video jittery things going on, it all adds up to my conclusion that the DVD version is transfered from a very, very bad analog copy. On top of all, the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled. Dont buy this unless you are a fanatic WKW fan who already own all other releases..... 
 You Got Served was a horrible misrepresentation of what the b-boy scene is actually like and this instructional video pushes that misrepresentation even further. If you want to learn to breakdance buy the Breakdance step-by-step dvd released by bboy.org or any of the films in the Breakvision series 
 Ella Enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when I heard that they were going to make it into a movie, I was estatic. I marked the movie release date on my calander, got my tickets in advance, and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater.  The movie was a huge dissapointment. While I wasn't expecting the movie to be just like the book, I certainly wasn't expecting that. While the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie, I hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book. The only common thread I found were the names of the characters and the fact that Ella was cursed from birth.  I suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie, it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears, despite the fact that I've read it over 100 times 
 I did not like the layout of this book at all--particularly annoying was the fact that you had to turn pages between the "before" and "after" room drawing layouts-they should have been either put on facing pages or on the same page.  Also, her first book worked well because it seemed to focus more on average people with decorating issues, this book was definitely skewed towards people with scads of money like the people with the view home in Laguna Beach, who practically had walls made of windows--hardly what the average person is looking to showcase!  I would borrow this one from the library, but buy her first book 
 I bought this book because I need it for my His. class. From chap. # 1, I wanted to drop the class JUST BECAUSE THIS TBOOK.  Chapter 1: Referring to slaves and Native Americans "Within their own families and COMMUNITIES they made choices..."  My questions are  How many Slaves had choices??? What community of slaves?? Welcome to the Black Slave Community. The book is a joke  Slaves were not human for their owners. They were an expensive item. If the owner wanted to sell a Black baby, they were able to do it because the baby was the owner's property. The parents of this baby didn't have the "CHOICE" to say THIS IS MY CHILD. HE/SHE DOESN'T BELONGS TO YOU, SO YOU CAN NOT SELL HER/HIM. I think that this book and the authors do not respect Native Americans, African Americans and the history.  Also, the trade of Europeans with Native Americans . The book reads, "that the Indian was 'making sport of us Europeans.'" We, the people from America (the whole continent), lost everything we had in our trades. We didn't know the value of our gold, and we traded it for glass beads. So, What sport are we talking here? How this author want us to believe that we, people from America, fooled the Europeans 
 This book is one of Dean Koontz's worst.  Not as bad as THE TAKING, but right in there.  OK, here is the plot ... really, really bad guy kills girl and parents.  A girlfriend witnesses and escapes only to find herself in the hunt for really, really bad guy.  Girlfriend chases really, really bad guy and craters the guy, but that's not all.  During this (yawn!) high drama, the heroine finds a little girl that really, really bad guy has (yawwwwwn!!) captured.  After knocking off the really, really (yawwwwnnnnnn!!!) bad guy, heroine rescues little girl and adopts her. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! Oops, sorry, I nodded off.  Please Dean, can you recall this book?  I mean we aren't asking for an apology here -- just take this piece of junk off the market.  I did see where "new and used" has it for as little as 1 cent.  Uhhhhhh!  DON'T SPEND IT !!! It is not worth it !!!!  And Dean, when you are going to give your email address out to the fans?  Most authors do this.....but, you seem to be reluctant.  Could it be literary cowardice?  Inquiring minds want to know.    Much of Dean's work is excellent ..... this book isn't.  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 The book was more about wicca then the actually show. I bought it because I thought it was more show oriented. If wicca doesn't interest you I wouldn't buy it. 
 We used this book for our materials science class, and while it contained a lot of information the information was very poorly presented.  The text would often refer to figures and tables nowhere in the vincinity, and it was written in such a way that it was extremely difficult to follow.  They didn't emphasize the important parts, so it was unclear what we should've known 
 In "Rebel-in-Chief", author Fred Barnes does his best to prop up a failed administration.  Barnes is an inside-the-beltway Conservative commentator for -who else? "Fair and Balanced" Fox News, so it seems legitimate to question his impartiality.  Barnes praises Bush for taking bold action against terrorism, and providing unwavering leadership, even in times of decreasing public popularity.   But 2/3 of Americans know that the interests that Bush is protecting so fiercely are the interests of his base: "the haves and the have mores".  His energy policy was written with no input from environmentalists, while the CEO's of the nations major oil companies were invited to secret meetings at the White House with Dick Cheney, an unprecedented access to power.  Was anyone surprised when those companies who are enjoying record profits were the beneficiaries of munificent tax cuts at the tax-payers expense? Very little progress has been made in the last six years towards developing alternative sources of energy or increasing CAFE standards. I guess we will be drilling ourselves into oblivion. Bush and Cheney are consistent in one important way; they never forget who put them into office.      Bush is never held accountable in Barnes' mind for the debacle of Katrina. FEMA, which functioned efficiently during the Clinton years under James Lee Witt, was fused into the mammoth Dept.of Homeland Security.  Led by Michael Brown, a political hack who lacked the qualifications to run this key agency, FEMA became incapacitated by budget cuts and interagency in-fighting. No one holds Bush accountable for acts of nature, but a key function of government is to protect and defend its people. This was by all accounts, a failure of government at all levels.     Bush is also given a pass on his poorly-planned invasion of Iraq, and his failure to make the necessary personnel changes due to personal loyalty. Many have confused stubborness with steadfastness.  The most successful of our war time presidents -FDR, Lincoln, Wilson, Truman, have understood the need for a change of leadership at the top when the policy was failing. Instead, the public has been subjected to a pro-Iraq PR campaign that has never acknowledged the reality of the situation. Any nay-sayers were immediately attacked as traitors, discredited, or marginalized.  So this administration has put America in a situation with few options-if we stay the country will dissolve into warring factions, if we leave the country will dissolve into warring factions. Meanwhile the spectres of Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and Haditha will leave permanent scars upon the nation's psyche, cause incalculable harm to our image world-wide, and poison the very hearts and minds we seek to win. Conservatives, Barnes included, cannot admit this has been a catastrophic failure.     Finally, Barnes' premise that Bush is a rugged outsider in the vein of Ronald Reagan strikes me as ludicrous.  Bush, the son of a former president, who has led one of the most priviledged lives imaginable is as well-connected as one can imagine. He's never had to work, and didn't for many years, while struggling with multiple addictions. After having bottomed-out, he became a born-again evangelical. This accounts for his belief that he was appointed by G-d.  And who can question the policy of someone with such divine connections? Does this divinity also account for his arrogant refusal to entertain opposing points of view?  History will decide 
 I first was a rent STAGE FAN, owning the original cast album and addictly seeing the play.  I then got this soundtrack, which leaves out 3/4 of the good songs.  I mean really: Angel does not even sing contact, and there is NNNOOO song "christmas bells".  Rosario Dawson sucks and should play britney spears, not Mimi.  I gave the original 5 stars and this one. OMG. Mimi should be EDGY not GLITZY. I feel bad that Daphne Rubin Vega had to watch her awesome part be ruined by Rosario Dawson's "valley girl" voice.  As for the original cast, especially Wilson Jermaine, their voices almost matured too much.So in the movie recording, Angel does not sound sweet anymore. If you buy the original cast recording you'll end up marrying the recording and worshipping it.  If you buy this recording it will etiher end up in the garbage or in the fireplace.   If you burn it-LAUGH 
 What a shame this DVD transfer is so aweful, because the movie is great. I have seen this movie before on SBS TV (Australia) and have been wanting a copy since. But this DVD looks like a transfer from an already poor quality VHS copy. Very disappointed 
 VERBOSITY, n. the employment of a superabundance of words; the use of more words than are necessary  This probably describes all this author's works. I had a terrible time wading through his bio on W.C. Fields and had to skip over most of it. I disposed of that book as soon as I was finished with it. When I got this book out of the library I had fogotten all about the author. But when I started reading "Stan and Ollie" I quickly looked at the cover and cried, "oh, no!."  I made it through almost three chapters before giving up.  Yet, I am a person who loves to read how an author weaves words together. That is part of the pleasure of a book. But this author doesn't weave, he just pours!  This book could be a third of its length and do its subjects far better justic 
 According to the Internet Movie DataBase this miniseries was originally filmed in 1.33:1, so that means that the signature edition is reduced from fullscreen to widescreen for modern theatre-style TVs.  That means a lot of the picture has been removed.  In my view this is a fatal flaw.  If you want the real version, get the older DVD set, as (in my opinion) this one doesn't have enough extras to recommend it even for people who own widescreen TVs.  UPDATE: Recently I purchased the Signature Edition of this miniseries as my old one was badly damaged.  So I had the opportunity to compare the two side-by-side.  I immediately put a sample of both the old and new DVD episodes.  Contrary to a later reviewer's assurances that this DVD set was filmed in 16/9 ratio, and that it was cropped for the original TV airing, I can now state with absolute certainty that that is not the case (or if it was, this edition has suffered a further cut, giving the viewer even less image - at least vertically - to watch).  The Signature Edition is definitely a cropped version, as it showed a distinct loss of image at the bottom of the screen in the clips that I chose to compare.  This does not apply to the titles, which have been re-done for this edition, and are an improvement for those of us with big screen TVs.  It may be that the miniseries was filmed in something like 1.66:1 as it may be the case that in the horizontal plane some image has been recovered, but if it was filmed in 16/9 (1.78:1) the Signature Edition does not reflect that.  Also, this DVD set has some very apparent visual flaws that are not evident in the original DVD release.  During the special effects sequences (during spaceflight etc.) there are often visible horizontal mismatches on the film.  These happen with almost every space sequence and are very distracting indeed because the eye is naturally drawn to the flaw.  To be completely fair there's no way I can tell whether this is a DVD flaw, or if it's due to the transfer from my DVD player to the TV - but it shouldn't be there and I don't experience this flaw with any of my other DVDs.  So my warning still stands.  This is not the definitive edition of this miniseries.  The original DVD release is the series as it was meant to be seen (uncropped vertically).  The Signature Edition shows less image and a poor quality image, and the visual artifacts make the spaceflight sequences virtually unwatchable, especially on a larger screen.  Needless to say, I returned this DVD set for a refund.  In my opinion it is sub-standard.  If this series was indeed filmed in 1.78:1 the definitive edition has yet to be seen on DVD.  I would like to see such an edition in the future - perhaps remastered and enhanced for 16:9 viewing and perhaps in a HDTV format so that it can really be appreciated on big screen TVs 
 Grey takes a European vacation with his girlfriend and others but on Elba has his first (?) sexual experience with another man.  This apparently converts him and he returns to New York to take up with Scott, a whining, unappealing stereotype of the nelly queen.  Grey also has a brief, undeveloped fling with his boss, Bob, and then is driven back to Elba where for half of the book nothing happens between him and Paolo.  There is much potential here but it is not delivered.  The dialogue is also stretched, with Italians inexplicably saying "ya" with the same frequency as the Tennesseans in the  story.  On top of all of this, the book is frequently just weird.  Chapter 25 is totally unexplainable.  Some, but not all, chapters begin with cartoonish sketches of floorplans or maps.  Drew Banks, the author, may want to say Able Was I but this effort doesn't support it.  
 One word, terrible. I asked for Nosferatu's Rise (awesome) for christmas and my mom saw this album under the "users who bought this album also bought" category. Save yourself the agravation and pass this one. I feel like Ive been robbed because I put the time into listening to it. There are only two good songs on the album and one of them is all but ruined due to shabby recording quality. The rest either are ruined due to the recording quality, or have terrible lyrics and crappy music, or usualy both. Hunter's kiss is sung in the first person from the perspective of a deer that has just been shot. Stupid stupid stupid. If you want an album like this except better in every way buy the soundtrack to the Witchblade comics. You won't miss out on anything if you dont read them as I dont and still thought it was awesome. Common, Peter Steele is on it 
 If you love hip hop then don't buy this video. It's a mix of movements that are NOT hip hop 
 Actually, I found Kathryn Davis' "Versailles" to be very well-written, but as the author herself admits, she was never interested in history in school, and it shows. I think she should stay away from  the historical genre, and focus on possessed doll houses and other arcania. After reading the very authentic and exciting novels about Marie-Antoinette and her family by Elena Maria Vidal, I kept asking myself if  Ms. Davis was indeed writing about the same people. There was hardly any resemblance at all. How could Louis be so flabby if he was always hammering away at his forge and horseback-riding and hunting? And yet Davis persists on describing him as such. One cliche after another, and charmless cliches....Antonia Fraser in her biography "Marie-Antoinette: The Journey" says that Louis did not really have a phimosis or require surgery at all to consummate the marriage so I wonder if Davis did the most basic research. Antoinette wanders about in a vague, hazy paradise, not really in touch with anything or anybody, so different from the dynamic, engaged queen who organized charities for the poor. Davis has her saying that it doesn't really matter if she and Count Axel von Fersen were lovers or not. I guess it would have mattered very much to her husband...and to the Count, too. The title of the novel after the palace where Antoinette lived made me nostalgic for warmth and intimacy depicted in Vidal's "Trianon," named for her private retreat, which is scarcely mentioned in Davis' book. And I missed the supernatural element in Vidal's books, as well, although Davis makes some attempts to capture the mystical aspect of the queen's confrontation with death and life, quoting the queen's dead profligate father, who said, "There is naught save eternity that is without end." But no extremes of good and evil here, no exploration of what her tragic life was really about, just a depressing depiction of a lost, clueless woman 
 This book gives you glimpses of the influence Drucker has had on society. But, unless you are looking for a biography, I do not recommend this book. It is dry and tedious to read 
 I loved this item for a long time.  It is quiet and not unattractive.  But, I have had it for a year or so, and now it is not working.  The pump seems to be broken, because when I add water to the resevoir it stops flowing and sometimes days later it will suddenly turn back on.  It is also difficult to clean in certain parts that are hard to access for scrubbing, but good at trapping orange mold.  I also bought one for my neighbor a while back and her cats refused to use it 
 I can't believe what a useless waste of space this "vacuum cleaner" is. I've had it less than a year. On the 2nd use, the first belt broke. It goes through belts like my 3 year old goes through clothes. The hose won't consistently stay clamped to the handle, falling into your knees as you try to push the thing. I can't get through a single job without it clogging and respreading the dirt everywhere as I try to unclog it. Its a 3-4 step process if it clogs further inside the filter sending me into a full-blown asthma attack (and my asthma is pretty mild). Its going to the curb on the next trash pick-up because now the clamp that holds it locked upright is now broken and I don't even know how that managed to happen. I guess at about $90 you get what you pay for. Those Dyson's better be worth the $[...] because I'm getting one tomorrow 
 While this book gives some helpful information I was overwhelmed by the detail.  For me it takes alot of the fun out of making and enjoying homemade bread. As one who has been successfully winging it for 25 years, and experimenting with different recipes, the detail in this book, I believe, makes bread making more akin to rocket science than something to do on a weekend morning so one can have some tasty homemade bread with dinner.  Keep it simple, keep it fun 
 I opened this book without having read a single review, armed solely with the knowledge that it had won the National Book Award.  I wish I had been armed with a paper shredder.  For such a rich and potentially captivating topic, Tuck did a horrendous job.  The life of the beautiful Ella Lynch, mistress South America's most enigmatic and charismatic tyrant, should have provided us with cutural and personal insights beyond a standard history text book.  For example, I would have liked to have finished this book with an understanding of how Francisco Solano Lopez managed to inspire 60% to 80% (depending on your source) of his country's inhabitants to die in a war which had absolutely no rationale.  Instead, I got a good solid dose of the Latin Lover.  Tuck did her research, but not to a greater degree than any high school student.  At no point in the story did I gain an understanding of the causes of the war, or of the unique political and social position held by Paraguay in South America at that time.  Not only did Tuck miss the broader context--the political rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, the constant power vacillations of post-independence South America, the struggle to establish national identities--she completely failed to establish the character of Paraguay and Paraguayans.  This is as unforgivable in a historical novel as failing to develop the characters (a feat which Tuck also manages to accomplish!).  Not only did Tuck do a slap dab job with South American history, her writing was consistently poor.  Long botanical lists which had no relevance to the plot (what little there was), letters, diary entries, which were all meant to provide the reader with verisimilitude, merely slowed down the prose.  Short,almost cartoonish, sexual encounters between undeveloped characters, one-paragraph vignettes, strange graphic violence, all gave a disjointed quality to the prose which made it tempting to skip paragraphs, if not whole pages.  Last, but not least, the author clearly does not speak Spanish.  This wouldn't have been a problem had she employed the services of a native speaker to check her error-ridden manuscript. (And where, pray tell, was her editor?)It was highly irritating to wade through grammar mistakes that a first-year Spanish student could have caught and corrected.  All in all, a highly disappointing read 
 I had a hard time finishing this book. The characters were all created nicely, but the book bored me, the end was just too bland, nothing shocking, and no resolution for the reader. I won't read any more of his books. 
   I was really looking forward to the release of this movie, but I will not buy a movie in 1:33 ratio when it has been cropped.  After reading the other reviews, what I feared seems to be true.  The movie was not filmed in 1:33; yet Disney did not seem to think it was worth the trouble to put out a great DVD in the original aspect.  They did this with "That Darn Cat" as well; another great movie I won't be purchasing because of the inferior quality of the DVD.  They did this before when they first put out "The Absent-Minded Professor".  Thankfully they put out another edition several months later that was in the original aspect, 1:66.  I'm hoping they will do the same with "Castaways" & "That Darn Cat" as soon as possible!  I will wait to purchase them when that happens.  
 I think that this is a classic example of the problems with alternative punishments.  Not that I wouldn't like to see vast improvements in how we handle prisoners, but this is a prize example of the arrogance of untested theory.   With the vague half-vast planning that attends so many vast ideas, Menninger pompously assured us that "men of science" would solve all our problems.   The statistics that I have read don't bear this out.   Psychologist are USUALLY wrong in predicting whether or not a released prisoner will later become violent.  It almost seemed a little cruel reading this book.   Menninger praises indeterminate sentencing at our Patuxent Institute here in Maryland as the shining light beckoning to the future proper criminal justice.   Crime was a social sickness, and should be handled by doctors, who would know when people could be released.   In the mid-70s, the same people who had mouthed these sentiments were denouncing Patuxent as cruel, indeterminate sentences as monstrous.   I may not have the figures for the prize case absolutely correct, but in the ballpark, a man had spent 19 years in Patuxent for an auto theft; he would have served about 18 months in prison.  Apparently, the good doctors are competent to release someone, but not to hold them.  The aforementioned man, after all, wasn't supposed to be undergoing punishment but treatment.   Supposedly, he was suffering from a disease as real as any physical ailment and his anti-social behavior arose from a real inability to control his own behavior.   Stealing the car was merely a symptom of this illness, not evidence of its severity.  If we are supposed to believe that psychprofessionals can tell us that it is safe to release someone, they should be able to tell us when it is not, and we should therefore believe that the above-mentioned prisoner was not yet fit to be released and presumably would have committed more crimes and been re-arrested.  But, indeterminant sentencing was modifed so that no-one could be held at Patuxent longer then they would have been held in prison, so the Institute began to specialize in particularly grim crimes, usually exceptionally ghastly murders.   Concerns about the goal of returning these people to society caused an embattled administrator to complain because people wanted Patuxent to deal with people guilt of lesser crimes (like car theft?).  She complained that such were often more difficult to treat than the extremely violent.  So there we have it - if treating people as mentally ill has no better result than treating them as willfully irresponsible, shouldn't we simply go for the cheaper system?  Or are we simply to accept criminal behavior as the just punishment of us as a society for failing to meet to social needs, effectively abolishing the idea of crime and take no coercive steps to control it?  Are we really sure that we have only to choose to take better care of our citizens to ensure that no-one will be traumatized into antisocial behavior?  In all situations, I believe that it is a given that we could do better, indeed standards of what constitute an adequate job are always changing, but will it really eliminate all our problems?  The problem is that people cannot seem to make up their minds whether most people should be held accountable for their actions or not.   The present system assumes that in most cases they can, and that punishment is intended to make them decide that the possibilities of the crime aren't worth the risk of prison.   "Crime as a disease" assume that they cannot be held accountable, but most people still want to retain legal structures and protections intended for the former case - a real dog's dinner of a system.  Maybe one day, crime can really be handled in a rational way, based upon meaningful research.   For now, it seems to remain a clash of egos and insufficiently supported philosophies 
 I cannot imagine what Sony or their sad, sad technicians were thinking - or NOT thinking when they "remastered" this great musical.  I HOPE - and one can only hope - whomever it was that "remastered" this music (and I can't imagine why they would call it re-MASTERED) that they got FIRED afterwards or went back to basic recording school.  MASTERING a musical CD means that you check your levels and balance - something they either forgot to do or were too busy talking while they should have been listening to what they were doing.  Did Sony imagine they'd be able to sell this on it's own merits...that being an attractive, well known, sell-able music CD of a charming musical - while duping the buying public (sadly ME included) that it would be something worth having for any Broadway music collection??  Well I was most assuredly fooled.  Even with my cheap (Sony by the way) 2 track tape deck could have come up with better than this rendition.  I just cannot abide that some highly technical "master" of recording equipment couldn't fix this before the thing was committed to a glass cd master to be cut in quantity, offered and distributed as a "remastered" version that SHOULD have been BETTER than the original but sadly isn't even close.  I thankfully, still have a cassette tape version of this musical from when it was first released many years ago and prefer that to this impossible display of cd "mastering" I have EVER heard - and I've heard a lot of quality remastered CD's - but this isn't one of them.  THE ONLY saving grace of this CD is some of the extras that have been included.  But not at full price..if you ask me.  Think twice or at least understand at the outset what you're getting....a very poorly "rekindled - NOT remastered" CD that has some singers sounding as if the "technicians" forgot to bring up the volume on those tracks.  Pretty sad, pretty sad.  Disappointing.  Love the musical - HATE the lousy CD 
 I sympathise with the theme of this novel and I really wanted to like it. The ugly face on neo liberalism should be exposed more often.   Unfortunately, the exploration of the idea is studded with cliches and the  writing is often too self consciously cute for comfort - Billy Bragg songs  cover the same territory with far greater ease 
 I had just purchased the hp cd and some of the cds were corrupted. 
 I generally hate writing a bad review since I believe in every effort being praised, however this book was an absolute waste of time. The book is a compilation of clichés and myths about the Balkans, having worked there for three years after I read this book, I can with full confidence congratulate the publisher on the selection of a catchy title for the book - aside from the title there is nothing of value in it. I wanted to find out more about other works of this author since I was shocked with the amount of ignorance he had of the Balkans and yet embarked on writing a book on the region - there must be something to it! Well, I noticed that Mr. Kaplan seems to have set a similar pattern in writing for other places of the world without knowing them! Like in Balkan Ghosts so in other works of Mr. Kaplan, the reader always comes across a mysterious personage that the author has met quite by chance and has had a conversation with on a subject that oddly fits the plot of his book, be it the Serbian lady or the African monk in his later works - there's a work of this, is called fiction! And this is where Balkan Ghosts should be, in the novella section, for it makes a nice fiction.  
 Don't buy this book, unless you have a copy machines that enlarges in your home. Very disappointed. Will never buy a book from That Patchwork Place again 
 This book is very disappointing, as is most of Gunaratna's work on islamist terrorism. It's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear, ie. bin Laden and AQ are everywhere, responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups (such as JI) are AQ franchises - total bollocks. The book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a "scholar" who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary 
 Cressida Mandeville wants to recover her family's fortune.  Her reckless idiot father gambled away their property to Lord Crofton.  Her father had hidden jewels in an erotic statue and Cressida agrees to be Crofton's mistress for a week so she can get the jewels back.  Tristan Tregallows, Duke of St. Raven, poses as a highwayman to clear his cousin's name and, thinking Cressida needs help getting away from the evil Crofton, kidnaps her.  They spend the next 350 pages being stupid.  This story was a mess.  Tris was okay for the most part.  But Cressida - what a hypocritical, judgmental harpy!  She's the Worst. Heroine. Ever.  She agreed to be a lecher's mistress, does all kinds of inappropriate things and still looks down her nose at Tris?  She's a sanctimonious shrew.  And ew, ew, ew, on page 359 she decides to have sex with Tris (they're not married) and says, "I want to be closer to you, Tris, than I've been to anyone since I slid messily from my mother's womb."  Blech.  That's romantic HOW exactly?  I've enjoyed some of Beverley's previous books and wonder what happened with this one.  Thank goodness I bought this from a used book sale that benefited the public library - at least some good came out of the experience.  
 I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs 
 I recently read "I", "K", and "L" in succession.  Compared to "Innocent" and "Killer", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising.  With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line.  I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome.  Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).  I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in "L" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.  Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly ("M" being one of them) 
 I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc.  That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO?  Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory .. 
 Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one. 
 Dear Amazon, I paid for this but until today I did not received it, I wrote to the supplier and until today I did not received any answer from him 
 Thanks for the reviews, I'm glad some of you enjoyed it. Sorry to tell you though there will be no more "Berkeley Square" as, sadly, the BBC decided not to continue production. You'll have to let your imaginations  fill in the blanks left over 
 I'm rather disappointed by this edition of the MM.  Too few monsters for one thing, and and not many truly interesting monsters in what IS included.  As with the other reviewers, I agree that multiple class-options for each creature type is unneccesary [to the point of being an unwelcome waste of space].  Gee, 5 new orcs - I'd much rather have had 4 totally new MONSTERS.  The stat blocks are the same as the ones used in Dungeon Magazine, so I didn't find them that hard to follow.  The addition of Knowledge checks for each creature *IS* helpful, but took up too much space - it could have been done as a side-bar and in smaller type.  Ditto the information in Forgotten Realms and Eberron settings - it would have been more useful as an appendix than mixed in with the creature descriptions.  On the positive side, the art is good [better than in most recent books] and the editing seems proficient [unlike most recent books which are chock full of errors] - basically it's just another thing to add to my collection rather than a reference that I'll actually use 
 First I will say that JAK was not previously on my must buy list and judging from this book she will not be there any time in the near future.  For me, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting and at many times annoying.  I didn't even like the dog and I have now been informed over and over that jogging will ruin my knees.  The mystery part of the book seemed almost like it was thrown in as a second thought and made absolutely no sense.  I thoroughly enjoy a well-developed romantic mystery but this is certainly not one.  I might give JAK another chance sometime but hopefully I have helped save someone's time with this title. 
 6 volume series? he man could have easily compressed this into 400 pages, but he's so long winded with everything. And reading this feels like i'm standing at the front door with Jehova's Witnesses. Ender's game was great. It deserves 5 stars. But i'm almost convinced it was written by someone else 
 I have to wonder what world, what physical plane, what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on? Or maybe they are Full Moon employees LOL...First of all, the movie, especially one of the earlier scenes, was identical to the 80's flick "The Unnamable", which is also and HP Lovecraft based flick. The castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit. When he breaks out his cell, well this was just hilarious, it reminded me of the incredible hulk. Yes, Jeffrey Combs is in it. But his acting is cheesy as it can be. Hunt down The Unnamable instead, a much better movie 
 order this item only if you do not need to use it immediately and can wait for a long time. i do not know how long because i am still waiting 
 I actually read this entire book just to see if/how Beatrice would get what was coming to her. Yes, the book is about incest. The ads and cover I've seen for this book state something like "Murder, Incest, Betrayal" or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest. The thing I didn't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex. Sex scene after sex scene. I frankly belive it's better to leave it to the imagination. We all know what happens when you have sex. But really it seemed more wrong that Beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love. It wasn't just the incest that was gross. Gregory's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times. After everything, I think what Beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts I've ever read. This book was at the most okay and I do not recommend it 
 i'll admit i havent even read the book. perhaps i will in the future, but a few incorrect "facts" fly out while just gazing over the material available online.  the most glaring is that "Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney was Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney's Aunt." get with it she was his mother, obvious she named her son after her father. anyone who has read either's biography would know that. and for other sources John Hay Whitney "JOCK" was his cousin not his brother 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 I normally praise Disney's animated movies, but I've got to draw the line somewhere. I can't believe the average review for this movie was 41/2 stars. I found the characters in this movie annoying, even more annoying than that suv commercial where that guy walks out of his house and parachutes off the cliff. I urge you to buy Treasure Planet, any Disney Pixar film,Tarzan before this one 
 Much is made of dyson's intellectual prowess; this just goes to show you that all things are relative. There are organisms shuffling down the street to whom dyson's intellect would, one assumes, seem impressive. But that don't necessarily make it so. You may, at some point, have heard the term pinhead. The term signifies that the owner of such a head has a tiny little brain, a "peabrain" if you will. This, in a nutshell, is dyson. He meanders around offering weak commentary and observation that appeals chiefly to the MTV and BET crowd. This is to say, he offers nothing of value other than allowing Penn to make their quota. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs 
 Don't get me wrong: Jeph Loeb, chief writer on DC's terrific "Superman/Batman" series, has done outstanding work with these two players -- the rock solid foundation of the DC Universe ... but VENGEANCE -- by its bitter anticlimax -- feels very much like a conglomeration of ideas instead of one masterful story from start to finish.  Loeb begins with a Super-opening: Superman and Batman appear from a Boom Tube (don't ask, you've just gotta know what one is to really appreciate what happens here)and kill a superhero called Skyscraper who presumably murdered Lois Lane; incensed and out for vengeance, the Maximums -- this world's Justice League -- vow to hunt the Man of Steel and the World's Greatest Detective to the ends of whatever universe they inhabit in order to have their revenge ... and right there -- at least for me -- is where this story FELT like it wasn't going to be quite right: superheroes represent the best any world has to offer, and these Maximums want vengeance.  They want blood.  They want to kill Batman and Superman for taking one of their comrades away.  Honestly, right there, I was wondering if this was a tale for me.  Not too many pages later, I'm struggling to get through the mental and verbal gibberish of not only Bizarro but Batzarro, and I'm thinking, "Geez, Jeph Loeb really needs some time off."  VENGEANCE isn't a total loss.  Loeb's a great writer with a fantastic imagination and an uncanny ability to seal himself inside the minds of these two superheroes to show the reader what makes them tick, and only from his learned hands can you find so many wonderful moments in an otherwise forgettable story.  There's not only two worlds at play here; there are, quite possibly, dozens, as Supermen, Batmen, Supergirls, Batboys, and the like show up from earnest supporting appearances.  Granted, it may not make a whole lot of sense, but even THAT makes sense once you find out which dastardly villains are behind this whole world-hopping, mind-blowing affair.  Yes, it's worth a read, and, yes, it's arguably worth forgetting.  Remember the little moments along the way, and keep your fingers crossed for Loeb to appear in top form again real, real soon 
 This book is a bit dated.  There is no use for this book if you want to get into this business on a serious basis.  Poor style, poor grammar and very poor content.  The author devoted 75 pages on trade agreements such as NAFTA and the EU.  You don't need to know the technical details of these agreements.  You need to sell, sell and sell.  This book is very bad.  If you want a primer on the ins and outs buy get Exporting, Importing and Beyond.  After that, buy Building an Import/Export Business by Weiss (this book gives you techniques that are absolutely useless but it is important to know this...so you don't do what he advises).  You can round it off by buying How Small Business Trades Worldwide by John Wiley Spiers who gives a no-nonesense approach.  Back to this book.  Carl Nelson really needs to update this book to include E-bay and recommend Frontpage or Dreamweaver to create a Website instead of saying it is "easy" to use HTML.  In this business, a website isn't necessary but it may be a good idea to have one if you want to market directly to consumers. Also, consider getting into this business by starting off as a Manufacturers representative (consider William H. Krause book on How to Get Started as a Manufacturer Representative) This book was plain AWFUL.  
 This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good.  But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes.    The final fight did't work for me either, and the very last scene I thought was pretty unnecessary.  Did anyone really remember Joey Wong was in this movie by the time that the end came.    The commentary on the DVD was one of the better ones that I have heard from ric meyers 
 This is a bridge book. Do Not waste your money. I agree with some of the other reviewers. Slow is not the word. Wait for book 4 then read the reviews and see if it is better. Hopefully a lot better 
 Porter writes as if the North was never wrong, its commanders never fooled or mistaken, its armies never disspirited, and that the Union campaigns always succeeded. We all should know better. According to Porter, every time the Confederates didn't hold a field they were "repulsed handsomely." Every time the Union didn't hold the field, they were merely "compelled to retire." You will see these gross aberrations throughout this stale and shoddy work. His characterizations add nothing fresh about the famous personages surrounding him, and certainly his military perspective offers less in quality of insight than the diary of any Union private. There are many great books on the Civil War by the figures who fought it: this one can wait until you've exhausted everything else 
 This is an over analytical view of the Charmed ones and really provides no interesting information only made up theories. I was hoping for a little information on the show,insight on the characters or gossip about the outside lives of the stars of Charmed.  I found this book boring and couldn't even find any interest in it what so ever even though, I am a huge fan of Charmed and would recommend you save your money for the Charmed magazine or the paperback book series which is far more satisfying 
 The author has touch on many a NLP techniques and has not talked enough about them to enable the reader to learn those techniques 
 I bought this dish about 6 months ago and use it on a regular basis.  However, when baking some fish at moderate oven temperature (375), it split into two separate pieces with a loud "crack"; there was no extreme temperature changes either. Go figure 
 I agree with others! Season by season BOX SETS of Beavis & Butt-Head are what we fans want! With all music and B&B commentary and no damned edits of anything!  Until then, Mike Judge & company, I will NOT buy anything B&B related, relying instead on my own VHS recorded episodes(limited in number of episodes as they are at least they're the complete original episodes)that I've transfered to DVD.  I want each and every episode uncut and in their original broadcast order.  Who's the brains behind the lame "Mike Judge Collection" series anyway?!? Some dumbass idiot working at Burger World???   Just from a purely greedy standpoint you'd make way more greenbacks by doing it the right way for cryin' out loud! Not to mention retain the show's and your integrity.   Hell, even Beavis and Butt-Head'd think this "Collection" concept'd be lame and stupid!!  Get with the groove Mike & Co. and give us what we want already!! 
 When I first glanced through _Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook_, I was impressed.  Every topic comes with an explanation of what it's about and a "How do I do that?" section that gives a step-by-step guide to getting it done.  Most also come with a "Why do I care?" section that explains why that topic is useful and a "What just happened" section, that reviews the material just presented and explains most of the technical details.  It seems like a perfect tutorial for Hibernate.  There is just one problem.  The "How do I do that?" sections _don't work_.   Either the author wrote them without checking them step-by-step on his computer, or they apply to older versions of the software and have become obsolete.  At almost every step I had to go through frustrating gyrations to get it to work, and finally gave up partway through Chapter 2.  Ant wouldn't handle the quick test at the end of chapter 1.  I had to build a table of contents for all the jar files on my machine and find the missing classes.  And I was lucky -- I had some jar files lying around from the last time I did some Java work back in 2002, that happened to contain the classes needed.  They weren't in the ones that came with the downloaded software recommended by the book.  The same thing happened again with the mapping files in chapter 2.  Run around and find the missing classes and put them where the JVM can find them.  Then came time to load the generated schema into the database that the book recommends (HSQLDB).  It turns out that HSQLDB wants a file, sqltool.rc, that for some reason is never mentioned in the book.  I made several attempts to edit this file so that the sample DB schema would work and I could get through the schema task.  I never did succeed.  Let there be no mistake.  I'm not an 11-year-old trying to start my first project.  I've been a software developer for almost 40 years -- compilers, operating systems, and applications.  If I have trouble with this book, what will a beginner make of it.  Moral: if you are going to write a tutorial that involves installing software, start with a clean install of your operating system and go throug step-by-step to make sure you haven't left anything out 
 I bought this recording with high hopes.  What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?  Well, not with this recording.  The cast is made up of "distinguished actors," the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line.  The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!  When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  For audio recordings, you need the best voices.  Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this.  My advice?  Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums 
 Sewn into the hem of an eighteenth-century cloak stored away in a museum, curators in the early twenty-first century discover twelve pages of handwritten notes, in code. When eventually deciphered these pages seem to indicate that shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin paid an unemployed dock worker a sum of money to murder, thereby silence, the lowly-born woman who had given birth to Franklin's illegitimate son William. The notes are apparently the minutes kept at a sort of judicial hearing attended in secret by Washington, Hamilton, Adams, and Madison, in order that the question of Franklin's guilt or innocence, and what to do about the accusation, be decided. Are the pages a modern forgery, an eighteenth-century hoax, or did one of the most beloved Founding Fathers truly spill blood to preserve his reputation? I wish I knew. After finishing this novel, I still don't. Lehrer wastes his first eighty pages on flimsy character building, then it's true he finds his stride for about the next hundred, but the trouble is, I'll tell you now, the ending is one of those variety that makes your head hit the table, because it's so frustrating. Books that fail to answer questions are rudely-composed. Why write what you don't finish? 
 I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big "thumbs down". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome! 
 I really don't like this book, and don't understand the positive reviews it got. It's a vague and shallow overview of a bunch of ajax-related framework that will not help you get anything useful done. Buy only if you have money to waste. If you are a Java developer interested in Ajax, and looking for a useful book, try "Practical Ajax Projects with Java Technology". Not perfect but worth some money 
 Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details 
 Anyone in the public health arena has heard (or even read) of Paul Farmer. The Harvard MD/PhD (Anthropolgy) is indeed a passionate and competant professional who has fresh drive and leads a commendable life in service to humanity. This book seems to be his most popular work (at least on campus of major public health colleges) and it deserves attention and analysis.     Farmer gives systematic treatment of HIV and TB etiology and prevalence in the US and Haiti. More importantly, how those diseases affect the poor in inequitable ways. Peppered with intimate anecdotes and cutting analysis, the book brings hard ideas with the immediacy of the individual plight. He debunks myth of AIDS early history and establishes perspetive for the disease to be viewed/studied in light of the poor and the strucutral violence that (he deems) causes the propensity of the disease in the lower levels of society. He offers solutions and pleas for attention to these 'new plagues' so that the effects can be mitigated for the sake of all humanity.    There are some issues with that perspective. Of course every author brings inherent bias to the writing (either intentional or not), but Farmer makes no apology for his worldview and dismisses opinions of others who are even within the sientific community as he. John Stuart Mill (in "On Liberty") would say that such an attitude is likened to assuming infallibility (which Farmer more or less accuses the attitude of the 'rich' toward the modern plagues). His neo-Marxist tendency completely undermines the state of the world and he therefore addresses his problems from a "the way it should be" approach. That is his prerogative, but taking such an attitude means that his ideas will remain just that: ideas. His lack of pragmatism borders a silent taint of militarism and that approach rarely attracts policy makers, even those on the left.     Farmer assumes that a preponderence of evidence precludes a serious analysis of personal aganecy. No one would argue the conflict of structural violence and the inherent effects on personal agency. Yet, the fact remains that it does exist and it at least needs to be addressed in a thorough matter in order to be a fair treatment of the subject matter.    Furthermore, he needed to address the distal factors (i.e etiology and biology of the diseases) with the proximate (i.e. socio-econimics, etc...) for the book to be of more interest to the lay person. Despite my reservations, it is still a great book to get the reader "out of the box" and see AIDS and TB with the urgency it deserves. Yet, this type of book needs to be in the hands of the lay, and this recommendation would help.    Lastly, Farmer claims on several occasions a foundation of political economy in the analysis of his subject. He is a physician and anthropologist, and without the concurrent opinions of a political-economist to back up his claims, the ideas therein are weak at best. His political-economic opinions may be in line with greats like Marx and Henry George, but he cannot assume the validity of his assumptions just by telling the readership he his resting on such evidence. Several other leading political-economic ideas stand in direct opposition to his conclusions of goverment fixing all health problems to his liking.    All in all, it is hard not to be moved by Farmer's compelling treatment of such horrendous plagues on humanikind. Yet, passion does not always equal pragmatic and working solutions. Therefore, his work will hopefully inspire those who can take his passion to offer clear and viable solutions in the war on these plagues.    Michael Jewell, MPH 
 Just like one of the other reviewers, I've probably read a good 20 Laymon books. And even though a few like Blood Games and Among the Missing seemed relatively pointless and more then a little boring most of the time, I made it to the end of their 350-450 pages. With this piece of junk however, I struggled until pg. 60 and then gave up. It seems the author was on a real woman hating jig for this one. Whereas most of this female characters are at least equal to their male counterparts, if not downright surpassing them in cleverness, as in One Rainy Night, the protagonist of Come Out Tonight is so pathetically stupid that I went from wishing bad things upon her to straight not caring enough about her to finish the book. The "Villain" is just some moronic nerd with a god complex and way to many issues, that we are subjected to over and over. If your looking for a good Laymon book, there are plenty. I personally recommend The Traveling Vampire Show, Body Rides, the Island, and Darkness, Tell Us. While all these titles, especially the Island contain perversion and stomach turning scenes, the characters found within them are in most cases realistic, easily empathized with, or downright loved. Check some of those out, or some of his earlier work, (Midnights Lair was wicked fun,) just avoid this piece of junk at all costs. You've been warned. 
 I loved the first book (and all of her other works) but this one while it held my attention also annoyed me.  Way too much time was given to the spoiled little girl and she lost me from the very beginning when it was explained that if she didn't get to watch the movie every day she screamed.  Sadly the adults were almost as spoiled as the children and it was hard to feel any kind of sympathy or empathy for the main character when she was the one who had created these brats 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 This is nothing more than a bad autobiography of the author.  A general "name-dropping, let me brag about my accomplishments and never tell you anything about how to accomplish the same things yourself" book.  I could have gotten better advice on songwriting from my 9 year old 
 I had my Pink iPod mini since Feb. 2005. It was fine until it died the next year on the exact day I got it, and the warranty ran out. I got it repaired at an Apple reseller, and then it died again  on the warranty expiration date. What is it with the iPods? It's like they have a self destruct inside! ):- 
 ok heres the deal. jaci is an average singer that has a hype of this superwonderful voice and powerhouse. it's not true. her voice is nice at best and her songs are (generally) trite and simple, with melodies stolen from current pop songs (tell me you can't sing Jennifer Lopez's (don't get me started on her sub-par singing voice)"if you had my love" to the chorus of jaci's "every time i fall". if i was j.lo's agent i'd sue). this isn't her only song that does this, but i can't remember anymore so it's hard to believe me, i know. :) I had (notice - HAD) the enhanced version that encluded exclusive interviews (!!) with jaci at home. it was all so touching...anyways. so i got "special insight" to the song on the album. she said everyone but her didn't want "crystal clear" to be on the album but she insisted. too bad she didn't listen. its one of those confusing songs that leaves you thinking "wait...are you talking about God...or your boyfriend?!?" if you wanna sing a love song (which CC most assuredly is) than DO it! don't try to pass if off as singing to God, cuz it just comes off as a little weird and confusing. and I don't have enough time to get started on "Adore Adore Adore Adore...etc etc etc" what she needs is a window (ok ok it's a bad joke sorry). but actually i like to use the door when i hear that song. i don't recommend this to ANYone! if you MUST get a jaci cd, then i hesitantly suggest "unspoken"(also a kinda dumb song but 2 to 3 star cd). ok im done 
 We used these radios on a Corvette road tour to the national convention in San Antonio.  Had no problems, great response.  Batteries appear to last more than a few days 
 AMAZON'S ALBUM DESCRIPTION UP THERE IS WRONG, THIS ISN'T THE ALBUM WITH 'THE RUNNER' OR ANY OF THE 19 TRACKS THE REVIEW SAYS... THAT SONG YOU CAN'T GET HERE 
 A rewiver In a big music magazine wrote that this record reminded him of Bottle Rockets and The Drive-By Truckers. He must be kiddin`. You can't compare apples with oranges. I rather say It sounds like Bon Jovi were playin somekind of Nashville pop-country, like the Great Divide.  Some compare this to legends like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Allman Bros. They couldnt have been listening to the same record as me!  But If you like Shelby Lynne and Pat Greens newer stuff, lend an ear to these guys. But If you want blood, search the real thing In these bands The Lost Trailers thinks they have something In common with. 
 While the writing was acceptable, I felt that the juxtaposition of the classes in this novel was very forced.  The differnce between the classes is too obvious.  The contrast between the rich world (the students in the Wilcox school and the Cornhills) and the streets of London (and Isa's forced marriage to the grocer, and Mrs. Cornhill's predictable and obvious snobbery) was not one that led me to feel any of the injustice.  I was left cold by the overall plot.  One thing that truly bothered me was the fate of Mr. Cornhill and Isa.  I felt that the way it happened in the book left something to be desired, and was not in true Bronte style.  The characters and their development also left something to be desired.  They were too predictable at times, and Mr. Ellin was just annoying.  There were few occasions when I sympathized with any character, other than Isa (and only at certain points in the plot). There was nothing spectacular about this novel, though I won't discourage anyone from reading it.  It was fast paced and it did hold my interest.  
 I really feel stupid about ordering this book. Why did i do it?. The story is that Stacey is moving Back to New york 
 i order those shoes because they matched the dress perfectly, then the shoes arrived, they were brown. nothing like the picture on the site 
 This book is perhaps the most disgusting display of blatant prejudice I have ever witnessed in a work of fiction. I don't believe Mr. Caldwell could possibly have interacted on any personal level with any of the people whom he so cruelly and stereotypically portrays. As a resident of the South, I have had literally thousands of narratives of the Great Depression passed down to me through family and friends. None ever reflected anything in the realm of this book. "Tobacco Road" reflects a view that poverty equals inhumanity, and this could not be farther from the truth. As social parody this book is almost entertaining--but taken as seriously as the tone of the writing encourages, it is ludicrous.  
 Unfortunately, Mr Bickle's book is little more than unauthoritative ideas taught with authority.  Many of his statements of truth begin with, "I belive that" and "I am convinced that" followed by teachings that cannot be proven in the Bible.  He lifts up Paul Cain as a prophet equal to Old Testament prophets. Hmm.  Cain has claimed that Jesus rode in the car with him one day and in order to discourage his upcoming marriage, placed his hand on him and removed all sexual temptation from him for life.  Of course, Cain would later fall into sexual sin.  Old Testament prophets aren't what they used to be.  Bickle is the prophetic movement's damage control arm.  He is there to do the PR when things go wrong. For example, in this book he relates that one time a prophecy happened where a man told another man he was to have a music ministry.  Bickle says that guy blew the prophecy because what he really saw was musical notes surrounding the guy.  He interpreted the prophecy wrong. Oh, if only God would stop being so unclear!  I could go on, but I don't want to take the time. If you are a believer, pick read ALMOST ANY book on Bible interpretation and learn to discern truth from falsehood.  If only Bickle had done so as a young man, we wouldn't be subjected to such nonsense 
 Not very happy with this product. The software on the pc side doesn't work well at all. Won't list all my files and I can't get it to update changes or new folders.  This bugger has way to big of a foot print.  The remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies. Hey I have a Xbox with XBMC on it. Get a clue, and copy some of it's functionality. It continues to blow away any of the media players I have purchased 
 Sometimes a hit isn't as good as the second time around. Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series debuted in the slow, ponderous "Eye of the World." The follow up is "The Great Hunt," with a slightly better plot and some Machievellian intrigues, but the first half "The Hunt Begins: The Great Hunt, Part 1" only illuminates Jordan's many writing flaws.   Rand and company have arrived at the home of the Aes Sedai, the female sorceresses who now hold his fate in their collective hands -- because he can do magic, albeit by accident, they might "gentle" him. What he doesn't know is that Moraine and the Aes Sedai leader, the Amyrlin, are secretly plotting to keep him safe -- because they suspect he is the Dragon Reborn.    All the Aes Sedai intrigues are interrupted when the stronghold is invaded by trollocs and a Myrdraal -- and a message for Rand is scrawled on the wall in blood. Turns out that they were stealing the legendary Horn of Valere, which can raise dead heroes. So Rand and his friends -- including Mat, whose life is bound to a stolen dagger -- go out in search of the horn.    Robert Jordan's books are slow. Really slow. Incredibly slow -- the hero, Rand, spends a hundred pages fretting about something that never happens. He spends an entire chapter getting dressed. Long books -- Dosteyevsky, Thackeray, Tolkien -- are often good things, richly nuanced and full of intricate plotting. But Jordan just seems to be describing everything in detail.    The plot itself has promise -- the action scenes tend to be swift, gritty and tense; the idea of a stolen horn that can raise the dead is an intriguing one. But between it is endless pages of quibbling and personal tics, as well as dozens of minor characters who have no bearing on the plot. For example, Jordan introduces countless Aes Sedai, but only two other than Moraine have any plot purpose.    Sadly, Jordan's writing isn't up to the challenge -- he reads like a second-rate pulp writer. The force of ultimate evil is called Shai'tan (can't he come up with a better name?), and just stops short of cackling out loud. The characters all interact by flirting or bickering, usually with women expressing disdain for the men. Jordan devotes a great deal of attention to the jewelry and clothing of the characters, even devoting a paragraph to a piece of Moraine's jewelry.     The characters are more like a collection of tics and personality flaws than actual people -- Rand spends all his time worrying, but breaks out long enough to be a hero. Nynaeve and Egwene pull their hair and snipe, while Perrin feels inferior and Mat flirts. Of all the characters, Moraine is the only one who comes across as a person, especially since she keeps most of her plans to herself.   "The Great Hunt" is one of those fantasy books that could have been quite good if about three hundred pages had been whittled out of it. As for "The Hunt Begins: The Great Hunt, Part 1," it's half of a bloated fantasy sprawl 
 I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.  Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.  I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well 
 I was hugely disappointed with this book. While some of the new 3.5 rules features are nice, those familiar with its 2nd edition predecessor, the Monstrous Manual, will find the more aesthetic aspects of this book lacking.  Firstly, the quality of the illustrations in this book doesn't even come close to that of the 2e Monstrous Manual (the same could be said for most of WOTC's illustrations). Some creatures don't even get an illustration.  Secondly, the book is poorly laid-out. This has already been discussed, and WOTC rectified it in subsequent MM publications -- but they should seriously consider re-revising this book.  Thirdly, the editing is almost nonexistent. Barely a page goes by without some sort of typographical error (ie. cleric spelled 'clertic' or 'x monster is about is about y feet high'). Hell, the sub-editors didn't even notice that their entry in the credits is written as "Editorial Assitance". There is a proofreader named in the credits, but it's painfully obvious she didn't actually do any proofreading before the book went to print.  In conclusion, while the 2e Monstrous Manual might be obselete in terms of rules, it was a much better product. It had more monsters, better illustrations, a better layout, and better editing. It was better value for money than this rubbish. Sadly, though, if you want to run a game using the d&d 3.5 rules, you're going to need to get a copy of this book. See if you can get one second-hand, though, as it's really not worth the price new 
 I have about two years of hands-on experience managing a Windows Server 2003 domain in a small-business environment. Recently I decided to pursue MCSA Win2k3 certification in order to learn more about the technology and better fulfill my job responsibilities. I bought a 3-pack of Sybex books for exams 70-270, 70-290, and 70-291 (this one).  The book for 70-270 was awesome; I read it cover to cover in 6 days and took the exam on the 7th. I passed with flying colors (score 860 with only 700 needed to pass). The only objections I had with the book were its many terribly-worded sample test questions (both book and CD) that were too vague to answer. However, the content matched the actual exam very well and I had no complaints after passing.  The sample test questions for 70-290 didn't get any better, but this book was also well-written and matched the exam's content --- for the most part. While taking the exam, I noticed a few questions that I *knew* weren't covered in the book. However, I still passed the test with a score of 811 and I didn't make a big deal about the missing content.  Then came exam 70-291. I devoted a total of 16 days to studying this book because it was more technical than the last two (not more difficult, but more detailed). I earned roughly the same scores on the book's practice tests that I had on earlier books (about 87% - 91%), so I sat down at the testing center rather confident that I would pass without any difficulty. WAM. 20 questions out of my 55 were on subjects that were NEVER MENTIONED in this book (these include DNS Forwarding, Aging and Scavenging, ISA Server, and others). I failed this test with a score of about 640. Because the last two books were so great, I was absolutely shocked by this one's shortcomings and I resolved to reread the chapters on DNS and DCHP just to make sure that I hadn't forgotten about some of the details. Sure enough, the information just wasn't there. I purchased sample tests from Self Test Software and retook the exam to earn a score of 760 (not that great, but more than enough to pass).  I am willing to give Sybex the benefit of the doubt by conceding that it is possible -- or even likely -- that Microsoft changed their exam content after this book was published, or that my test questions were not necessarily representative of an average test. However, I still wouldn't recommend this book to anyone studying for exam 70-291, and I decided to purchase a Microsoft Press study guide for my last (elective) exam on Exchange Server 2003 
 I admire Vollman's ambition in this novel.  He is a thinker who seems to be attempting to tie together aspects of religion (Buddhism, Christianity, and Paganism . . . ); commentary on the differences / similarities of love, lust, and addiction; Capitalism versus Marxism; racism between all colors of all people; classicism; reality and fantasy; misogyny; unions; child-love or child-molestation depending how you look at it . . . the list goes on.  And this is exactly the problem with it.  The connections are vague--not subtle.  Fragments connected by tiny threads that fray as the book continues leave us suspended in a kind of weird sickness--ready to fall.  If I were Vollman, I would have let this book sit for a while and then returned to it in an attempt to clarify and condense . . . maybe map out this Royal Family to make it worth his while and worth our while as readers.  His characterizations and insight about human fraily are immaculate.  I don't advise giving up on him yet.  He has potential.  But I don't think spending days reading this will get you anywhere but depressed and tired 
 I paid over $150 for this watch a couple of years ago, and I loved it when I first bought it (as do many of the other reviewers on this page). However, it took about 18 months for the band to break, and then less than 2 years for the watch to completely die. The solar charger slowly quit working - at first I just couldn't set the hands on the watch because it was stuck in "recover" mode, but the digital display was still correct so it was still somewhat usable. Then after a few months of this, everything went blank. I sent it off to Casio expecting a quick, inexpensive repair (or even a free repair, as I expected them to stand behind their product). Shortly thereafter, I received a repair estimate for $94.11 - more than the watch currently sells for brand new! So...in my opinion, the watch is probably worth the $69.00 that it currently sells for, but don't expect it to last more than a year or two. I won't be buying another Casio 
 The metal pieces on the sides looked like they were going to slice my cat's throat!  threw it in the garbage 
 Sure enough, I tried to get away cheap, and got bit in the you-know-where for it.  Three months after buying it, the card is unusable.  The lifetime guarantee?  You need the original packaging and receipt.  I suppose I can only really blame myself for not saving it all, but hey, it was a well reviewed $20 card, right?  So now it's a holiday, with everyplace closed, and I have no flash card.  You get what you pay for 
 This "lab manual" is VERY thick and far too wordy.  Really, it's more of a spiral-bound textbook than a lab manual.  Additionally, the lab questions appear in list format at the end of each section, so there is virtually no standardized answersheet for students to record their work on.  That not only makes it harder on the students, but efficient grading is nearly impossible unless the instructor makes his/her own taylor-made answer sheets for the students to use on EACH lab.  As if that weren't bad enough, the lab manual's companion web site is horrid.  I am amazed that the AGI and the NAGT produced this lab manual 
 I feel I must be missing something as there are so many positive reviews for this book. I did not even finish it. All of the reviews say it is smart and funny. I suppose I'm not bright enough and don't have the sense of humor it takes to appreciate this book. To me, it appears to be nonsensical stream of consciousness dribble. Just writing with no real clear direction or organization. I am a fan of Vonnegut's other works. Unfortunately, this one was not for me. I'm not sure what others saw in it that I didn't. Maybe they're just very loyal to Vonnegut. I don't know. I cannot recommend this book. 
 Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. 1 Ladies...series.  No comparison.  The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book.  I just don't understand the rest of this book.  Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face.  The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book?  I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read 
 Although there have been some updates in the essay on Christian Science, it's very sad to see the persistent attack on Mary Baker Eddy based on falsities. I have no knowledge of the other "cults" under discussion, but my knowledge of Christian Science is so different from what is written that it makes me doubt the accuracy of anything else published in this book. The falsities abound, starting with incorrect names and events. But the most egregious errors come from the ridicule of a theology that is misunderstood and misrepresented. I kinow several conservative Christians who have changed their minds about these claims after we've had a chance to have an honest heart-to-heart discussion of these issues. Please listen more carefully to those who know the subject matter better 
 I was looking forward to a some good new recipes and have to admit that I was disappointed with this book.  First of all when I opened the box I saw that this book was a really small paperback book that was poorly made.  I was further disappointed when I read the recipes and saw that one of the recipes for the "Best" dips calls for canned bean dip.  The book doesn't cost that much but it's still not worth it in my opinion 
 I usually really enjoy Jayne Ann Krentz and her alter ego Amanda Quick, but I actually returned this one to the library unfinished. I found it boring and the whole dream reader concept to be unbelievable 
 This movie stunk. I hate this movie. I should throw my copy out the window. I should pee on it. The way you shake it i cant beleive it you make my pee pee go badoing doing dump 
 I only bought this cd for the song "Under the Water" that is unavailable anywhere else. The rest of the cd is dull and will most likely give you a headache after listening to three songs 
 Recently the gal who started Moderation Management as a response to AA was convicted of killing two people in a drunken driving accident. AA's response to that was no comment. AA's response to Peele is no comment.The truth is that AA is not for everyone. Nor has it ever claimed to be. It is for those who want it not for those who need it.  The proof of the effectiveness of the AA approach is the hundreds of thousands, if not millions,  of people who have stopped drinking and learned to live productive, helpful lives 
 This book was so poorly written that it was almost impossible to keep track of what was going on. Often times the editing was so bad that the wrong person was being named in the wrong subject matter. The author's thoughts were not well thought out and certain facts were repeated multiple times in exactly the same sentence used in chapters before. For a book that is being presented as true crime, and factual, Mr. Glatt failed to keep his information straight, often contradicting points he made in one chapter in the very next. Since I reside in the immediate area where this crime occurred, I have first hand knowledge of the surrounding region, and can say that often in his accounts were not just slightly off base, but wholly inaccurate. I was excited to purchase this book and disappointed when I wasted the time to read it. This man, Mr. Nyce got away with murder, and the book failed to give the victim a voice, for someone who is capitalizing on such an atrocity I found it distasteful that more time wasn't spent elucidating his wife's life other than her infidelity with regard to their marriage 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 This book is a good start for someone that has no idea what to do to take care of their muscles and joints.  As a martial artist, active in the gym (weights) and a therapeutic massage therapist, I found this book to be a waste of time.  On the positive side, it is a quick read and I have reinforced, by second oppinion (the book), that I know more about taking care of myself than the average bear.  In purchasing this book, I was hoping to find something that I didn't already know or something that I didn't think was common sense.  If you have never played sports, never taken care of your body (stretching, contrast therapies, proper posture) then this book is for you 
 This book is drivel. The author teaches you to approach men, chase after them, research their lives and backrounds, etc. I thought it would be an interesting book, but she actually fills the pages with advice like: give  hints to let him know you'd marry him if asked, men don't like white shoes  after labor day, and she even has recipes and word lists!  The fact that  she herself has not managed to snare a millionaire and her mother is  divorced because her own father was cheating tells you just how effective  her advice is in getting a rich husband and happy marriage. If you must  read it, get it at the library, but don't pay for it. I wish I hadn't 
 I ordered the regular size, they were to big, the smaller size? too small. neither one fit well but both did one thing well, hurt the area under my eyes. Buyer BEWARE 
 The heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive, but it's mostly advertising.  Very disappointing.  It does have some useful info and I do enjoy reading it (which is why it got 2 stars from me), but I definitely won't be renewing my subscription 
 I know I was taking a chance buying a beanie online, but it was a great price so I rolled the dice.  The quality of the beanie is great; it looks like it would last for a long time, and I really like its looks.  And I do have a decent sized dome (7 1/2 in fitted hats).  But this lid fit my one-year-old son's head better than it does mine.  It kind of sits on my head like a yarmulke, barely covering my giant bald spot.  So if you're concerned at all about it being too small, it probably is.  If you've got a smallish noggin, this would probably be a sweet beanie 
 To use a Mets phrase, "It's amazing" that Jeff Pearlman can make a living focusing on the dark side of people. Baseball players are people - period. They have talent to swing a bat, run, throw a ball, but this does not make them enlighted, beyond temptation or anymore newsworthy than my father, an insurance executive who drank too much, was abusive to his family and as great as he was at work, could have been so much more.   This team is a microcosm of the real world and there are companies out there that make the story of the 1986 Mets pale in comparison.   Yes, Gooden and Strawberry could have been Hall of Famers, but they were strong at baseball and weak at life. This makes them human, not tragic.   We do love to put people at pedestles, simply to knock them off and watch them fall.   The 1986 Mets are my favorite team of all time. They had heart and they went into the season with the highest of expectations for them, and won.   What more did you really want from them?  Spend your money on a book with an ending that you don't already know. 
 When I received this book for Christmas, I was excited. As I read the book, my excitement palled and has become dismay. I find it, though somewhat informative--at least the names of prominent medievalists are given--generally a venomous reflection on those with whom Cantor did not agree. His ascription of venal motives to a number of historians, particularly the Annales school, is not an objective assessment of their contributions to  historiography. Were this book billed as a personal polemic, it would be correctly labeled. One may gain some insight into the construction of Medieval history, but if one lacks any prior introduction to the subject, this is NOT the book for the 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 This book is not good at all. I lived in the valley for 2 months this summer and have learned to hate it. Despite the previous rating, Don Reid is DEFINITELY no master at getting you to the climb itself. He often has only a sentence or two telling you how to get to hard to locate climbs. Furthermore, the so called stars by the "best climbs" often mark some of the worst cracks... 
      I bought this from Amazon, it arrived, I used it to try to fix two discs.  The product seems to work only closer to the center and does not do much on the outer 3/4" or so.  It has you use a solution in one of the steps and you are suppose to put on 2 or 3 drops, which I did.  I placed the disc back into the machine as instructed.  After the required 3 minutes of spinning I opened the cleaning unit and removed my disc.  One of the drops had not even been touched.  So, not only is it not fixing my disc, it can't even remove a drop of fluid.       Also, there was some kind of contamination on one of the discs.  It looked like a stain about 1/4" across and I was hoping this device would clean it off.  It didn't.  Having nothing to loose, I put some Windex on it, rubbed gently, and the spot went away.       So, some of the scratches went away, they were near the center, end of story 
 First he says he cracked down on all those "liberals" but yet he admits to loving their evil ways. If this is as wishy washy as he can get, no wonder he and Sam Donaldson get along ! You can't expect to be credible if on the one hand you attack them but on the other hand enjoy a nice and cushiony rich job offer from these same "liberal media". If he were working as a farmer in Idaho for instance, he'd have more credibility but I'm not so sure Stossel says what he means 
 Excellent performances by strong ensemble cast. Heavy-handed moralizing hurt this film. Technical military flaws also detract from the story but not the performances. 2 stars only 
 Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish.  There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption.  I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out 
 This book looks to be an in-depth expose of the lives of presidents since Kennedy.  However, it quickly turns into a anti-Democrat and Clinton-bashing book.  Johnson is portrayed as a compulsive liar and serial adulterer and Carter is described as a disingenuous hypoctite.  Reagan, on the other hand, is portrayed as a nice man who was a wonderful human being.  While this may be true, it is worth noting that this is the same man who lied to the American people about his knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal and who left office with the worst budget deficit and highest unemployment rate in American history.  This man also declared war on the world power that is Granada and bombed that country back to the Stone Age.  The auther seems enthralled by Reagan and repeatedly describes him as a great communicator (which he was) and a man who could make you feel good.  Of course Reagan could do these things...he was an ACTOR!  That is what actors do!  The worst part of the book is the end.  Kessler wrote this piece in 1995, just over 3 years into the Clinton presidenc.  Yet, criticism of Clinton dominates the book and is almost 2.5 times as long as the chapters on Reagan, Johnson, and Nixon who each served over 4 years.  Kessler condemns the press for not investigating Clinton's lies about his philandering and makes the case that since Clinton can't keep his Billy in his pants he is unfit to be president.  If that were the ultimate judge of a man's ability to govern a country, most of the world's countries would be left without a leader.  Also, U.S. presidents throughout history have had mistresses: Jefferson, Cleveland, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Roosevelt among others.  The fact is this book does not reveal any bombshells about president's secret lives; all it reveals is Clinton's healthy extramarital sexcapades.  Clinton-haters should love this book, though there are better books available on the subject 
 Despite being a comedy show, this turned out to be a rather depressing experience. There were a few amusing bits here and there, mostly there, but the targets of the satire were very lame.  Most of the parodies are from pop culture in the 1990's, so they are extremely dated.  The "Information 411", "90210", and Yakmin Shirmnov sketches were particularly painful to watch, as bad as anything on SNL.  I only made it through the first 8 episodes, and skipped the last 5.  The commentary on episode 8 was more interesting (check out Garofalo screaming how she hated kissing a sock puppet because she hates "sexuality".  I still don't know what she meant by that) than the actual episode.  As we know, Ben Stiller became a star playing neurotic, clumsy nerds, Andy [...] has done a plethora of drugs and seems to be on the path of being the next Courtney Love (in terms of obnoxiousness and drug intake), Janeane does supporting roles in mostly forgettable (and sometimes wretched) films (even though she does have talent), and Bob Odenkirk did Mr. Show and recently (as of November 2006) directed the awful Let's Go to Prison.  The only sketches I remember in which I mildy laughed were the "B Minus Time Traveler" sketch.  Stick with Monty Python's Flying Circus, which is still unsurpassed in sketch comedy.       
 As a parent of a young girl, this seemed like the perfect Christmas present.  Since it is cartoon themed, it is sure to be a hit with any avid Dora fan.  Also, the dancing theme is more feminine than your average video game, which is perfect for young geek-ets (like my daughter).  However, beyond the initial concept and theme of this product, the game is a total flop, and parents should beware!  While the voice and graphics quality is decent, the game play is absolutely infuriating.  The mini-games are extremely repetitive and have difficult to understand criteria for passing.  For instance, one of the stages requires you to click to make the characters dance in time.  However, the animals you are attempting to mimic move at a lightning pace while you painstakingly inch the characters arms up and down one degree at a time.  Getting the timing to match the invisible metronome is frustrating at best, compounded by the long-winded instructions they repeat on every failure.  Rather than being the exception, in every stage you will learn to share the frustration as your child attempts to figure out a new eccentric game that is somehow themed around dancing, but has little educational value whatsoever.  However, the difficult control mechanisms do a great job of covering up the fact this game is rather short in content and length, focusing more on poorly animated skeleton-like character jigs than educational content.  I have also purchased several other Dora titles form Atari, such as "Backpack Adventure" and "Fairytale Adventure", and have enjoyed playing them with my daughter, so this game is definitely not representative of other Dora products.  I just hope other parents can avoid the disappointment and frustration of purchasing this product. 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 I personally really didn't enjoy this book. It was a waste of my time. Who really cares about his life. My teacher assigned the book and i was forced to read it. It was pain. I think he could of made it more interesting but unfortunately he had a very dull life. My teacher compared this book to Boy and in my mind there is no comparison. BOY was great book and Knots in my yo yo string was definatly not. I enjoyed reading boy but HATED reading knots in my Yo Yo string. IF you want to read a book i would definately recommend Boy and not Knots in my yo yo string. Thank you for your tim 
 Having just paid [...] for this product, I expected the word processing component to have at least the basics.  Wrong. To me, the ability to easily format a business or legal document with "page x of y" at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental. Well, Works 8.5---unlike other Microsoft word processor versions or programs---does not provide that choice. Without this basic a "feature", you might as well simply use Wordpad.   I cannot comment on other abilities this program has or doesn't have, or, on the spreadsheet or database modules, because I simply don't want to spend any more time on this.   Recommendation:  Go to OpenOffice.org and get Open Office for FREE 
 I've liked these books in the past, but this one fails to inform or entertain. It's not terribly awful, just not very good. The writers are average or below average, and for a "best" anthology, that's not good enough. I wouldn't pass this book on to anyone, and that tends to say it all 
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 I am generally not into chick flicks and THIS movie is one of the big reasons why! The characters were so phony, the plot was tired and the ending was exactly what I expected. Famous girl meets regular boy, they fall in love, the end. I don't even have to write a spoiler because every little girl (and grown woman) knows how a fairy tale ends...If this is your thing you will love this movie. On the positive side it's a very "pretty" movie with a beautiful setting etc, etc. Once in a while a romantic comedy or chick flick will get me going, this was not once nor a while, unfortunately. 
 the nokia bl-4c battery i got is a counterfeit with fake number 0406040703000042032 
 Don't believe the hype. This movie sucks. Nothing happened. The ghost of a boy and a lady showed up every now and then,then the movie ended. I'm not one to usually complain about or laugh at cheap effects. I actually think that the so called low buget 1980s movies look a lot more realistic than todays CGI. But I just had to laugh at the sound that the ghosts made. I imediately reconized it as a sound I used to make with my mouth all the time as a wee lad 
 This was TOO SMALL! The description says "women's" but there is NO way a woman will fit into this top. "6th grade girl" would be a better description. The price was great so I ordered a large but I usually wear a medium so I was shocked when it didn't even come close to fitting. 
 "The Beast in the Jungle" is the most effective sleeping pill you are likely to find anywhere. I challenge any reader to go through this text in one sitting and not falling asleep or, at least, not to experiment a tremendous mind-numbing feeling. Of course, I haven't read all the books in the world, but I dare say that this is the most boring piece of writing ever conceived by anyone. I find it very hard to imagine something more awful than this. It's absolutely impossible, unsurpassable.  Henry James' style is so artificially conceited and pompous that you have to ask yourself if the trash he used to write wasn't a very calculated joke after all or if he's just trying to take the reader for a ride (a ride into a world of dullness and boredom, that is). The supposedly "psychological insight" of James is just a mere exercise in nothingness, the highest form of pretentiousness in its purest expression.   In this short???-story (James wasn't very strong on things like "precision" and "conciseness"), the terrible fate that seems to be in store for the main character after pages and pages of monotonous text, turns out to be that "nothing is to happen to him". Pathetic and childish. In my opinion, "The Beast in the Jungle" is the greatest proof that James was a dreadful writer (not to say "an insipid donkey").  Actually, James is so comical as to excite parody. In the old days H.G. Wells likened his prose to an hippopotamus pushing a pea and Ambrose Bierce said that James' work would benefit if someone took the pain to translate it into English. I personally agree with the two of them but, you know, many things that in the past have been judged as "ridiculous" or "stupid" are considered today, through some arbitrary process known as "reassessment of literary figures", as something pretty relevant and sophisticated. That's life, isn't it?.  "The Beast in the Jungle" is a poor story that serves James as an excuse for writing a lot and not to say anything significant. Completely worthless. In case I had to choose, I'd prefer to read a telephone directory instead.  Of course, this prime example of literary incompetence is regarded as a masterpiece by many scholars.  Well, each to his own.. 
 This would be a great compilation, but they chose to include the live version of "Over My Head" instead of the studio version. WHY?!!! The live version stinks. And "Over My Head" is a fan favorite. It's probabaly the first song most of us ever head by King's X....because Atlantic sure didn't do much to promote "Out Of The Silent Planet"! Nope...we had to wait until Headbanger's Ball brought King's X to our collective attention. The STUDIO version of "Over My Head" is a powerful piece of work. And they deliberately replaced it with the weaker live cut. Again, WHY?!! Because the record companies are so busy tryig to be in tune with TRENDS, that the are totally out of touch with the FANS! If they really wanted to make a good compilation they would have given us studio versions of the hits, and given us better live cuts like "Manic Depression" From Dogman. Screw these record company buttheads. 
 I am sure some people would find this DVD useful, but it wasn't at all what I expected.  This may be attributed to my not being familiar with yoga, and have nothing to do with this particular DVD, but I wasn't even able to watch the entire thing 
 This extremely expurgated version sells for about a dollar a minute! So if you think a 15 minute (estimate) feature is worth the price, by all means, buy this. If not, save yourself the heartbreak I suffered 
 Returning this antenana because the performance was actually worse than the tiny standard Apple G5 antenna with its theoretically less advantaged placement under a desk.  Mac Stumbler rates the signal strength around 45-51 with the standard T shaped antenna.  Even raising the DWL-M60AT to head height the signal strength never rose over 43%.  Maybe the omini-directional standard antenna is better at dealing with the obstructions and DWL-M60AT would perform given clear line of sight.  Perhaps the larger Dr Bott directional antenna is worth the 5x premium 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 As a feminist, I hate movies that portray women as victims who struggle futile against the big bad evil MAN.  There are no good men in this movie.  There are no evil women.   Such portrayals of women are demeaning.  We are human beings, just like men.  We are capable of evil.  Men are capable of good.  Yes, some men would turn their wives into robots if they could, but so would some women!  And I find it ridiculous that not one man stood up for his beloved partner.  I find it ridiculous that not one woman was capable of true evil.  Are we puppets?  It also bothers me that if these women are so strong and powerful, that they are helpless against the big bad men.  The message seems to be that we can't save ourselves.  We are just doomed to be what men want us to be.  I hate this attitude.  Men are not all powerful.  Women are human beings, not saints.    Two stars, though, for capturing the fears of women everywhere 
 First off, I don't write reviews very often but felt some need to do so for this book. I am a huge Robin Hobb fan, I've read and reread the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies so often I need to replace the books. I enjoyed the Liveship Traders series, though not as much. I also found the first book of this series quite enjoyable, if a bit slow, much like some of the other reviewers I've read.   This book, however, was crap. Absolute, steaming, stinking crap. First and foremost, it was depressing right from page 1 to page 700 whatever. Now I enjoy a dark series, I'm a huge fan of George R R Martin and there's nothing shiny and happy about his current series, but this book contained no triumphs for the protagonist, only defeat after depressing defeat.   With regards to the characters I find Robin's supporting cast beautifully rendered but her protagonist severly lacking. The more I read this book the more I coulnd't stop thinking one thing. This is Fitz... with a gun.   Why the author persists in writing stories from the viewpoint of a teenage / young adult male is not for me to question. I do take exception to the Robert Jordan school of cookie-cutter characters however and trying to brutalize myself through 700 pages of yet another spineless, wishy-washy character who simply acts in accordance with the last suggestion given to him and is incapable of putting his foot down for anything, including his own morals is disappointing at best, and extremely frustrating at worst. Especially since Nevare actually seemed to be an original creation during the first book.  No so with this book.  With regards to the plot and pace, both were severely lacking. Again, taking a page from the Robert Jordan school of plot advancement, NOTHING HAPPENS. Let's sum it up! Nevare goes home. Nevare gets Fat. Nevare leaves home and spends a few days in a village. Nevare gets to an Outpost. Nevare digs graves and runs in the forest. Done! The events taking place could have been paced perfectly into a section a third its size and most of the big feels like filler. If the author only had enough quality material for 2 books, she should have only written 2 books.   I was a huge Robin Hobb fan and I can pretty much guarantee I won't be wasting my hard earned money on the next book of this series much like I stopped throwing away money on Jordan years ago. I'm glad this one was a gift or I'd feel even more cheated 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
   I enjoyed reading it, but I didn't find it very helpful. I have shown dogs only 3 years and found this book not very good. The guy talked to much about min games and psychology if you ask me.   I wouldn't ever spent money on it, but it was a fun book to read. If it's at your library get it.   I willn't suggest paying more then a few bucks for it.   If you really want a good book read: "Making it to Westminster" it's loaded with information and great to read, you willn't be able to put it down 
 I found it difficult to even complete the first chapter because of the verbose style of writing.  There are so many euphasims, comparions, tangents, etc. that the message is somehow overshadowed and it makes it  difficult to recall the main point the author was trying to make.  Not sure who the author's target audience was, but reading like this was worse than any graduate level text or professional journal that I have ever read. 
 I took a numerical analysis course last semester at my university and had a horrible time understanding this book. As many reviewers have already stated, there aren't very many examples and the explanations aren't very clear. I had to refer to a number of other books from the school library to actually figure anything out. Don't waste your money on this book, there are much better books on the subject out there 
 The book was supposed to ship two day ground but showed up 3 days late 
  This product is not good at all I had to return mine after only 2 weeks. I found out that it is really inaccurate and it doesn't work when you want it to. As for as the body fat percentage I couldn't even get it to work. Do not buy this product 
 Her writing style has changed for the better over the years.  This book was to much like a harliquin book.  Give me A Good Yarn anyday 
 The shaker is very good about keeping your hands from feeling the temperature of the drink as well as nice styling-- that is until you wash it in the dishwasher.  I should have listened to the other reviews, it does condensate inside the shaker so you can see water droplets under whatever colored material is used to make the outside of the shaker, and the stainless steal of the inside.  Of course, there is no way to seperate them to clean it.  If looks matter, it shows that stainless steel is probably still the way to go if you want quality 
 the third book on kindom hearts is bad. The story is out of place, the art seem worse than the others, and the adventures found in the book are very bad. This manga would have been better if it was written and illustrated by the creators of the game instead of this manga author and artist!! 
 As someone who lived (and, I guess, is still living) the life of a "gifted" person, I'm not terribly surprised by what I found in this book.  Many of the problems held by gifted students originate not from parents but from bureaucrats--people who want to figure out how best to control their talents for profit.  There isn't much profit for the parents themselves, so where's the profit going to come from?  Other than those kids marked by stock brokers and scientists for high-paying jobs, what's left?  Political profit, of course, and this is Quart's real goal.  Quart simply oppresses her topic into non-existence unless it can produce the right kind of person that will be sure to vote the right way.  Scrabble players, spelling bee kids, math geniuses...they're all weird at best and dangerous at worst, *especially* if they've been home-schooled or attend church.  Competitors in chess are hyper-competitive, but (surprisingly?) kids participating in politically-charged poetry slams are "encouraging" and "supportive".  She weeps for school districts that support the gifted and thereby thwart the  "equal results" that certain political groups seek, yet cannot find anything but disdain for programs that support the results of all students  simply (and clearly) because of the political party that happened to begin it.  Her descriptions of her subjects are caricatured so badly that one cannot have any faith in the descriptions.  And, as some have noted below, she has played loose and fast with those she quotes in order to make the right sort of case.  If you have the ability to ignore or refute the author's opinions through basic critical-reading skills, you can get a basic idea of the sorts of issues faced by the gifted.  If not, look elsewhere 
 Sure, it's steamy, and the leads are sexy, but we never really get a chance to know or care about them, so their bad choices and struggle to get together just never seems to matter.  In fact it was a little boring.  Plus, what language are these folks speaking?  I know it's English, but it might as well be French.  The supporting cast is universally nasty, selfish, uninteresting, and unlovable.    Not much to like here.  Avoid this unless you have a thing for bloody fights, of which there are a couple 
 The heater does  not function well.  The foot button is very diffifult to use and requires using my hands repeatable to get it to turn on or off.  The timer is a sometimes thing...not very reliable.  I am very tech savvy and didn't get much help from the manufacturer. I had selected this product based on a prior purchase from the manufacturer which was a good product. 
 I have never seen a WORSE production by National Geographic than this.  I have lost respect for them after this awful DVD. They did not do their homework, nor did they connect the dots.  Very disappointing.  Watch "9/11 - In Plane Sight" instead 
 i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit, but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting. The ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world.Dont even rent this, i dont even know why you are considering the film.  I only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since. 
 I bought the dual room iMonitor yesterday. (only available in store at Babies R Us).  It is the same as the one shown here, but it has two transmitters to montor two children.  Based on only 4 hours of testing, I am taking the unit back.    Pro: -The range was great.  Whole house, plus 800ft outside. -No interference.  I live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference. -Easy to setup. -Shape/size of parent units are much better than others (especially sony) Cons: -Controls are not very straightforward. -The unit always hisses.  It is not sound/voice activated. -The power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed.  When you turn it off, it does not beep or let you know that you did.  The button is easy to bump, and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off, and you think it is on. -The DEAL BREAKER: a power outage requires turns off child units.  With even a short power interruption, the child units come up in the "off" mode.  You have to go to the baby's room and turn them on.  Until you do, the parent unit will beep and flash red.  We have been using the Sony 910 for 3 years with our first child.  I guess it has spoiled us 
 I have first hand experience dealing with Ms. Morgen. I paid for and attended one of her 3 day courses. I even did some work for her. I was really excited to work with her at first, until I found out what kind of person she truly is. I totally agree with Gill's comments. Although many of her concepts have validity, I've seen her *not* use the same type of "we" space she advocates. I won't be specific, but I can say with certainty that I've never had a more unpleasant client experience. Ms. Morgen can be very rude, abusive and confrontational. Her opinion is if you don't agree with what she says then there must be something wrong with you. I would recommend this book for some helpful cold-calling tips, but I would not adopt Buying Faciliatation as my primary selling technique 
 It's a good book it just askes me as a student to assume too much.  Some of the problems at the end of the chapters are incomplete.  If i was to go about my life as a ME assuming random stuff i would get sued to a point of non-existance.  This book does not teach good engineering practices 
 I am a fan of utopian literature. It is a great measure of the human soul that we have these books. The spur us on to better ideals.  Sadly, we have abandoned these, replacing them with the ugly dystopian literature, and are worse of.  "Herland" is unique in that it is feminist utopianism.  It is so off-beast that I was excited to read it.  All of the classical cannon of Utopian Lit is all male: Plato, Moore, Bellamy, and so forth.  I was curious about what insights Gilman would have.  Sadly, I felt left down.  First of all,  having so many expectation for a book, and then being let down forced me to look deeper at what was going on. I had to reexamine my assumptions and expectations.  I realized that so much Utopian Lit is the same: people getting together, decided to stop being fools (in the Biblical sense of the word), and  actually doing what then should be doing.  Part of templette involves uniform clothing, large mess halls, centralized planning, and the un-Biblical open marriages.  Gilman covers all of theses, except the open marriages, which I will later cover.  In fact, there was nothing really new in this book.  This is not to discredit it, but to to convey the epiphany I had while reading it.  The utopias all have common elements, with minor modifications.  The problem with Gilman's book is in the virgin births to perpetuate her Amazon society.  This dues ex machina fatally shifts the story form Utopian Lit to mere fantasy.  All Utopian Lit must, of necessity, be atheistic. Otherwise, it becomes religious social philosophy.  There are some other problems, some of which come from outdated science.  For example, genetically, all the women would be identical, and the environmental conditioning would not change them.  Gilman has them with different features (p. 76, 78), a genetic impossibility.  Another problem is the centralized planning without omniscience and omnipotence.  "The best laid plans of mice and men . . ." We cannot control nature, predict earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or predict hurricanes.  Herland has none of these. It is a peach of an Eden, but detached from the real world.  Centralized planning never works.  We have limited knowledge.  And even if we know something, we have limited capacity to change things. We have Murphy's Law, entropy, and  Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.   Couple all of these with the Butterfly Effect of our ignorance and impotence, and it is a wonder that anything gets done at all.  I so not want to get into Praeto's 80-20 Law, except to mention that all utopianists, except the American Founders, completely ignore this principle, Gilman not excluded.   Most confusing is the birth control alluded to in Chapter 6 (p. 60).  If pregnancies are virgin, are they spontaneous, and if so, how does one control them?  This all comes back to the fact that this book is essentially fantasy, and not utopian.  Sometimes Gilman gets downright ridiculous, as in mentioning that babies do not cry (p, 88). I understand the miracle eugenics and "negative eugenics" (p. 59), but this is ridiculous. Crying is not an annoyance, but serves several purposes, and is the root of communication.  The religion is a disappointment.  It is just Social Gospel, but no power. It has virgin births, but no Virgin Mary.   Another problem is the nature of evil.  Gilman notes that "They had  no theory of the opposition of good and evil" (p. 87). That smacks of Nietzscheism, and is fundamentally at variance not only with the Laws of Logic, but also common-day experience.  By virtue of creating a Herland, she is setting women in opposition to men.  That is , she believes that society of Amazons is good, and mixing it with men is evil.  Aristotle said,  "There are some, however, as we have said, who both state themselves that the same thing can be and not be, and say that it is possible to hold this view. Many even of the physicists adopt this theory. But we have just assumed that it is impossible at once to be and not to be, and by this means we have proved that this is the most certain of all principles . . ."  "If all contradictory predications of the same subject at the same time are true, clearly all things will be one. For if it is equally possible either to affirm or deny anything of anything, the same thing will be a trireme and a wall and a man; which is what necessarily follows for those who hold the theory of Protagoras. For if anyone thinks that a man is not a trireme, he is clearly not a trireme; and so he also is a trireme if the contradictory statement is true.  And the result is the dictum of Anaxagoras, "all things mixed together""(Metaphysics, Book IV.4)  Herland is not Eden-it is a Fool's Paradise.  It is not practical, relies on a dues ex machine to function, and naive.  The most corrosive ideas is that men are not only unnecessary, but the chief cause of the problems in the world.  This is unabashed sexism, and ignored the fact that men are out there, and have things to contribute.  This is as radical as any male chauvinistic nonsense. Changing the genders does not confuse anyone.  If we were to implement Herland, what would be Gilman's final solution to the Man question?  She does not say-perhaps for the better.  Gilman is a pseudo-utopian. This book is not utopian, but more of feminist fantasy, which is just as bad a the male fantasies seen on cable TV.  I recommend this book merely as a literary curiosity, and not as a blueprint. 
 Being a looooong time Batman fan City of Crime ranks as one of the worst stories I have ever read in a Bat-title. Do not waste your time on this one. It was a 12 issue series that disappoints.  
 I am a very happy wife and mother, with fairly conservative views.  As someone who's career is in research, I am disgusted with what others are considering "well researched".  The author has taken facts and twisted to her own advantage, and to the disservice of women.  The "supporting facts" in the book are as comical as the cover.  This author attempts to make a few good points, but then ruins her concepts with overwhelming bias 
 This book was great.  I especialy liked the chapter where Bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker's hoo-hah.  Priceless 
 When I got this book, I couldn't put it down.  After reading it, I was anxious to get started on setting my goals as Mr Brown described in chapter 16, but I hit a roadblock.  Mr. Brown gives an example of the goal planner, but he didn't show how the math works to get the amount one should save each month.  Mr. Brown even states,  "The following goal-setting forms will serve as a map in guiding you toward your desired financial goals.  They are here to assist you in your planning.  Feel free to use the formula over and over again for your actual desires."  One frustrating problem, Mr. Brown gives NO FORMULAS.  I followed up by going to Mr. Brown's company website and sending an e-mail explaining my frustration, I got a reply telling me to visit the website and click on "need a financial plan."  This requires me to enter in my credit card information and be charged $25 for Mr. Brown to preform the calculations for me (the same calculations that should be outlined in Chapter 16).  In addition, I get a free copy of a book that I just bought.  WHAT?!  I bought this book expecting to be given the tools to be independent when setting up my goals.  Or at least to understand how calculations are made before I seek out professional help.  But Mr Brown only brought me halfway when he suggests ways to set up goals and then in turn doesn't fully explain them. 
 I'm sorry I wasted the afternoon reading it....was about the worst thing I have ever read in its category.  Would have liked to rate it as NO stars but that is not an option.  Just happened to read it because it has been sitting here for 4 years since my mom died and I took i 
 There are only four good songs on this C.D.! Don't get it, it is a waste of money 
 I think this movie is too bad, why?  because...  when you hire a woman body to act porn movie it's animality. when you share all of your feeligs casually, it's animality.  so be human.  be for one.  be valuable 
 Thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material, i ordered it thinking it was a good buy. When i got it in the mail, a week later, i was soooooooooo disappointed. The material is like paper/ potato sack material... Its awful.. Like plastic...  I dont recommend u waste [...] on this .. The jacket is stylish no doubt... but the material not something u'd actually wear.. So a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best. [... 
 Without religion it would be easy to see good men doing good things and bad men doing bad things.  With religion bad men can do bad things and justify those things under the guise of religion.  However good men can also do bad things behind the same religion.  Here we have a fine example of either.  You can pick which man you see here.  Whichever way you go it does not remove the fact that BAD things have been done.  That is the message of this book 
 I have a two-bedroom apartment with hardwood in the living room and bedrooms, linoleum in the kitchen and tile in the bath. I have four area carpets, two 8x10s and two 3x5s. The apartment collects its fair share of dust, but since it's just me, there is minimal traffic. My Swiffer electric broom that I got at the grocery store does a marvelous job of keeping everything clean and tidy. I've even used the Swiffer on the carpets, but because it doesn't slide easily over the carpets (I have to remove the dust cloth and essentially get down on the carpet on my hands and knees to manually run it over the carpet surface), I decided to buy a separate stick vacuum that could do a better job. Well, I wish I had heeded the negative reviews on this product. It is very loud indeed, louder than my old Bissell traditional carpet vacuum which long ago became so clogged that it is no longer functional. The noise really is painful to the ears. It blows dust and dirt away rather than sucking it up. You do have to vacuum over and over on the same spot to get it to pick anything up. Same thing on my hardwoods, linoleum and tile - it just blows everything around. Apart from the noise, this seems like an easily fixed design flaw. Guess I will be sticking with the Swiffer for now 
 Once again in fantasyland we go with fake "gangstas".P diddo or diddity, pifily poof what ever his name is this week.This movie is not worth the price of the plastic used to make it.the established italian mobsters would not put a black or puerto rican on equel footing.these guys would not share the same area in the joint.ridiculous!!!when it comes to TRUE GANGSTERS there are serious racial/ethnic barriers.That is just the facts.As much as the mass media tries to rewrite history it still doesnt change it 
 Cruel, horrible story with a typical Barr convoluted plot. The abuse of children, evil ranger poising as a dead ranger, freaky religious sect, dead animals on the bed, and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me. I've read many Barr books, and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters, it's hard to keep them straight. In this book, that was the last of my worries. I didn't even finish it, I was so turned off 
 The best part of this book is the first page, and then it's all down hill from there.  There really isn't that much of a plot, and the book is just boring and stupid, and to be honest, just not very well written.  I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading this book 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 I'll start out by saying that I am a complete idiot who does not know the first thing about calculus, but I do have 10 years worth of software engineering experience and have no trouble following complicated data processing concepts when they are explained in terms of procedures rather than terse, obfuscated, squiggly equations. The introduction in this book looked promising in that it seemed to be taking a step-by-step "this is how you need to juggle the pixel values around" approach to the concept of wavelet transforms, but as luck would have it, the very next page AFTER the freely available sample is chock full of everything I can't read and didn't want. Of course, my own ignorance is neither the book nor the author's fault, but a better description and/or lengthier excerpt from the publisher could have saved me a lot of trouble ordering and returning this item since it's not something a lot of brick and mortar stores carry on their shelves. The price tag is also more than a little steep for its size, but I suppose the book's target audience is college kids who are used to throwing away hundreds of dollars on whatever their professors tell them to.   I've no doubt that mathematicians will find humor in (and possibly be enraged by) my folly, but maybe this will save a fellow stupid code monkey a little time and money. 
 i really liked the first one and even went to my mom's house to pick up the second one (this) at 10:30 at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on. from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page 120. not much has happened to make me want to finish it. very boring. not really into roz and mitch characters, i don't think they are very well developed, they seem kind of blah. and the story is kind of blah. blah, blah, blah, and just words for the blah, blah, blah going on and on.  
 Dr. Cutler barely mentions the acupuncurist from whom she learned her methods, but it was probably Dr. Devi Nambudripad or someone trained by her. So skip the copier and get your information from the woman who discovered a way to truly eliminate all allergies, not just food sensitivities. Her book, Say Goodbye To Illness, is packed full of testimonials, some which include phone numbers and email addresses, which are truly miraculous. She also has a research foundation which has verified the effectiveness of her method, which is called NAET. Nambudripad's materials are much more comprehensive, and there are a lot more NAET practitioners around the country than there are BioSet practitioners. Dr. Cutler does talk more about diet and enzymes than NAET does, but it is also old info you could get in any natural healing book. I am disappointed I wasted my time on this book and will stick with  NAET 
 This is one of those books that glosses over everything glibly and reiterates everything that you already know in a cursory and superficial manner. If, however, you don't already know anything, this book would make a nice easy introduction and overview 
 I was expecting at least a little meat, and all that I got was some bones.  If you are Fundamentalist Christian, then you will be singing the praises! This is YOUR book!  If you are looking for intellectual discourse on the topic, forget it. This book will be a total waste of your time! This one does not deserve even a star. I did learn a valuable lesson by ordering this book...READ the Amazon reviews BEFORE you buy! I'm not Longing for Daddy, I'm longing for my MONEY BACK  
 I can offer no praise for Jeffrey Goldberg's book, "Prisoners: A Muslim and a Jew across the Middle East Divide".  Although Jeffrey Goldberg goes through the motion of tracking down former prisoners to see what their lives are like today, his consciousness and heart are never truly penetrated.  On page after page, Jeffrey Goldberg shows deep-seated fear of and disdain for the Palestinian people, easily dismisses their narrative, their history, and their longings.  He makes many negative references to the Quran, in his attempt to validate his own fears that Muslims are anti-Jewish.  At the same time, he presents the Zionist narrative as unquestionable fact.  His fears, ideological beliefs, and biases make it impossible for him to give fair treatment to the Palestinian side.    Where is the intellectual curiosity and ability to either distance oneself from one's own feelings or empathize with both sides that I expect in a good journalist?  After reading this book, I find it quite disturbing that Jeffrey Goldberg is a respected journalist writing about the region.  I fear it shows that the audience of readers does not recognize when Palestinians or other Arabs are being treated as sub-humans 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 This was a terrible disappointment.  More of a memoir than anything about book-collecting, it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was.  There seemed to be no context or fabric to the book.    There were, however, HUNDREDS of references to obscure authors, actors, film-writers, magazines and books.  There were pages at a time where I was completely lost because I had no idea about whom the author was speaking, but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader.  Baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia, thence to Britain to the US and ending in France.  Again, there is no context.  He would flip from a reference to the obscure artist, to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book.  If viewed as a book about collecting books, you will not learn much.  If viewed as a memoir, there was little that was interesting about the author's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions.    There were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector, but they were too few and far between.  If you could not tell by now, I can not see much reason to read this book.  I think Mr. Baxter flattered himself to think that either he or his collection would be of general interest 
 I gagged my way through The Notebook but thought I would give Nicholas Sparks another try.  I read about 1/3 of the book and decided it was a waste of my time.  
 The topic of suburban Christianity is one that deserves attention and thought. And I do agree with the premise of the book--that Christians must not give up on the suburbs. But although this book was well researched, it lacked a fundamental passion to really inspire and encourage the love of God in suburbia. Perhaps that was not the intent, but that is the book we really need to find!  What you are left with is some dry sociological information, mild commentary and a few tentative suggestions like "walk more" or "practice hospitality" or "simplify your life" or "remember how the other half lives" that any non-Christian book about the topic might suggest. I can and do get that type of social commentary from David Brooks. And generally he is more humorous about it too.   God can radically change suburbia through each of us. If we don't believe this, what are we discussing anyway? I believe what is going to get suburban Christians to make eye contact with people and invest in them is a love of God and God's love for people. If we don't care about our neighborhood barista then all the short-term weekend trips to urban missions are more about us than about the people we are suppose to be helping. If we are simplifying our lives to consume less (and save money) but not giving over and above our tithe to charity--again the benefit goes all to us. Ditto for our taking more walks if we don't end up actually talking to anyone new while walking! It's not all about you (or me) the suburban Christian.   To be fair I would probably be less critical of this book if the blurb from whoever Lauren Winner is didn't claim it would be "Provocative...even prophetic." That is what it is precisely NOT. Not provocative enough and not prophetic enough. Bill Hybels' new book "A Walk Across the Room," which talks about making personal connections, is a better guide book for bringing Jesus into your suburb. And as for passion, you can't beat Brennan Manning's "Ruthless Trust" or almost any other book he has written. If you care about this topic, suggest you read Manning to get the passion, pray hard, then do what Hybels says 
 I bought this pedometer for myself, and bought my wife a $20 Omron pedometer, and hers' is far superior. Easier to set up, more accurate, durable. Lesson: spend a few dollars more for something that works well. This one is disposable junk 
 Some of the medical information is very helpful.  My recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35, it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy, nor is it for someone who has young children at home.  Her hormonal theory, that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families, and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed.  Many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age.  Do I think that my total hysterectomy at 34 (and the obvious onset of menopause) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children?  Of course not.  That's ridiculous, and if I think about it too much, it's actually offensive.  Her comments about marriage are questionable, as well.  Marriages sustain many changes, and menopause is just one of them.  Open lines of communication, deep love and commitment are certainly enough to weather the "hormonal storm."  How sad that it seems as if one point of the book is that menopause is the time to assess your marriage.  Shouldn't we be doing that every day, and re-committing ourselves to growing together?    Many reviewers have commented on some of her more non-traditional methods.  I am not a fan of tarot cards, and I'm not sure how I feel about taking medical advice from someone who diagnosed herself on several occassions, by using them.  That's just my own opinion.  I tried to look beyond that.  I just think this is another book written for people older than I am.  That's okay, but it still leaves me looking for something I can truly relate to 
 We bought this for our son when he was 2 months old and he has yet to be interested in it. The music is very loud and he has no interest in playing with any of the buttons or objects on it. He does kick it and push it away from him, so I constantly have to push it back towards him. At 4 1/2 months old, he still is not that interested in it, but we keep trying it out each day to see if it will spark an interest. 
 I looked forward to this book but found it sorely lacking.  My biggest gripe is that the brothers jump in a few pages from their modest upbringing to b ig shot dealers wheeling and dealing million(s) dollars items,  There is no discussion of how this jump was made, or how they could manage to finance the huge purchase prices they describe.  Further the books deals in antiques that only the top .00001 percent of the population could actually buy.  Nor is there anything about the business end of things, like how one becomes a top line dealer.  Instead of focusing on real tips and experiences acquiring items that a serious (middle class) collector could hope to acquire, they focus on items that most millionaires would find expensive.  Don't expect this book to have any relevancy to you 
  Too bad I can not give Turbulence no stars.  This movie is just filled with way too many things that just stretch even the most liberal imaginations well past the limits of reality!  The whole movie just does not work.  The FBI agents are too easily overcome and out smarted by a self professed genius serial killer whose one dimensional actions make his IQ seem incredibly average to me.  Rather than being very smart the serial killer seemed a self absorbed slob who is overly impressed with his own lame exploits.  The rest of the airplane passengers seem like fawns or sheep.  Logic suggests when transporting a dangerous horde of hardened criminals the crew would be a select group of individuals hand picked for their skill at dealing with a plane full of diseased brilliant minded malefactors.  The plot is obviously concocted to introduce fawn like ladies and foppish men into the mix so the audience has a heightened thrill factor.  Problem is the other non-law enforcement passengers seem inserted into the plot for no good reason other than their role as pawns to be used by the serial killer to drag an otherwise painfully predictable lifeless story along to its all too formulaic end.  Also the Christmas lights festooned all over the plane when you are carrying hardcore prisoners is so over the top that you must wonder what the heck were the writers thinking.  Most hardcore prisoners are quite intelligent and could certainly turn all those dangling Christmas lights to their advantage in some vile criminal way.  No FBI agent or corrections officer  worth his or her salt would let a prisoner set foot in a plane that had so many opportunities for prisoners to escape their direct care custody and control.  Also the most glaring flaw in Turbulence occurs when even the most basic tenants of maintaining care custody and control of violent malignant inmates were overlooked again and again.  The Plane skimming over buildings through rooftops into structures was just plain stupid.  While most tall buildings roof top garden rooms and associated elements are lightly constructed they must stand up to high winds.  Add that buildings the plane was scraping had mechanical equipment towers where strong girders and supports reside that should have broken the plane up or at least damaged it more than was shown.  It is like the writers of Turbulence were a bunch of college drama students drunk and totally detached from reality got challenged to come up with a disaster thriller plot.  Drama for drama's sake without any plausible relationship to reality is not thrilling or action adventure it is just disjointed stupid garbage.  Turbulence is just garbage to watch when you have time to waste.  If you want real suspense on a plane get Air Force One.  Turbulence is an invitation to take a round trip to and from Palooka-Ville, the plane has plenty of seats available but who cares!. This Turbulence is just a bumpy ride that leaves you feeling sick.  I can think of better ways to spend time. 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 not being hip, I must venture out and say:    Oh my God!!!  What????  Who cares?  Franny is pregnant.  The big twist in this story was that it was in the 50s.  But beyond that, what's the point?  Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood.  Boring in the 50s and boring now.  As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey.  Holden was familiar.  Franny and Zooey made me want to shower.  I really wish I had the time back that I spent reading this trite piece of...         
 I just purchased the software and successfully installed it on my computer.  When I got to the point of entering dividends and capital gains, I couldn't figure out how to import the data from Fidelity that I've done for the last few years.  Looking around on the Fidelity website, I can across the following statement: "For the 2005 tax year, Fidelity information will not be able to be imported directly into H&R Block's TaxCut programs. H&R Block expects that these products will have this functionality restored for the 2006 tax year."  Unfortunately, this is the reason I'm using a software tax prep program, looks like it's back to TurboTax 
 I think I would've liked the book better if the author had said that it was "based on actual events". It read too much like a novel. While I have no problem with an author using creative license at times, some of the dialogue was too far fetched. I also found it impossible that he would know what the characters (for lack of a better term) were thinking, especially the target. There were at least two inconsistencies that I found. Not good. Makes you doubt the veracity of this version of the story. As a novel this would've worked. 
 This book was not enlighting, alot of the information was out date. The phone numbers to the locations were disconected etc 
 As much as I loved the movie, I was very disappointed in the CD. I thought this was suppose to be a soundtrack. It is not! The French songs in the movie were lovely, this version is not what I expected 
 In fact, it may well put you to sleep!  I agree with the S. Berner review and would add the narrator had a definite negative impact on the book.  While using a narrator may be a clever idea in some instances, here it detracts.  We had no idea who this narrator was until about a third of the way in.  The use of British idioms was annoying but finally made some sense when we find out the nationality of the narrator.  This is essentially a story about a non-story, that is, there is nothing to it.  It is really unfortunate for Mesce has written another one about Major Harry Voss, an interesting character, but Mesce fails to do anything with him.  Simply not worth the effort to read all the way through to the ho-hum conclusion 
 As someone interested in the Russian Revolution, I found this book at a school library and read it. I was not favorably impressed. Lenin is pushed down to the level of megalomaniac idiot. You don't have to like the guy to try to really explain his motivations or to seek real answers to the questions that bamboozle people. In addition to the pyscho-babble mentioned by other reviewers, I had a problem with Robert Service picking on someone who is to dead to sue him for slander. Robert Service accuses Lenin of shooting down his own Soviet troops (an absolute idiocy in the middle of a civil war).It may be fashionable to produce "exposes" of Soviet leaders, but that doesn't make it a good trend. Modern biographers of the Russian revolutionaries need to remember that Joe McCarthy and his Committee are no longer here to black-list them. In Robert Service's biography, I was upset to find the author judging Lenin through 21st century glasses. By this I mean: 1. Cutting out the context of the Russian economy's ruin during the Civil War. 2. The abject failures of the "democrats"  3. Forgetting what the alternatives would have been had the opposition won (I don't mean the Whites- even the peasants hated them) I wonder what Mr. Service would do if he were in Lenin's shoes...  While I'm wondering, I think I'll go pick up W. Bruce Lincoln's books on how the revolution happened and what happened during and after the civil war 
 Rush Limbaugh - the man most responcible for replacing the biased liberal media with the biased conservative media - giving millions of Americans false hope and dangerous half-truths.  I've had enough of this marketing phenomena known as "conservatism."  They have created a demographic group for the sole purpose of selling books and merchandise.  The anti-Clinton/Moore/Kerry books are the same junk as the anti-Bush/Cheney/Reagan books.  No on is interested in opening their mind  and learning-they simply want to reinforce their own shallow ideas, entertain themselves and feel comfortable in their own little imaginary world.  Forums hosted by so called Conservatives are run in the same close minded ways in which college liberals shout down any guest speaker with whom they disagree.  Meanwhile, the two parties (the only choice the American voter is given) are virtually the same when it comes to the most important issues.  Both parties are taxing and spending, and supporting the illegal invasion of America by Mexicans.  Big business is in bed with big government and they are both getting even richer by selling you books pretending to speak ill of each other.

 Having read only brief publications about TR, I can only claim partial qualification for this review. That said, I found this book to be highly insulting and disrespectful to the memory of Theodore Roosevelt. The author paints a picture of a man that was emotionally disturbed at best. How can she come to such far fetched conclusions when she has never even spoken to the man? The analytical process the author uses is  abstract. Nearly every page is filled with modern feminist language that I found to be very out of place in a book that is supposed to be about an important American icon.  I'm truly sorry and ashamed that I even picked up this book, let alone read it. This is revisionism at it's most rank. 
 Bought it for a present. It fell apart within a week.  What a headache 
 This machine looks great, but it doesn't have the power to remove absolutely all the air when sealing a bag. It also doesn't seal well enough to keep the air out. Every package I put in the freezer came out looking like I hadn't vaccuumed out the air at all. Not worth the money, even at this price 
 Why oh why did I buy this useless thing?  I have a perfectly good Cuisipro mesh 13-inch screen, which does what it is supposed to do, namely reduce the spray of grease spewing onto the burners, walls, and floor.  Is it perfect?  No. But it definitely does most of the job, which is what I can't say about the Tovolo.  It has three fatal flaws.  First, the working end of the detachable metal handle is proportionally too small to securely and safely leverage the screen off. I had to use  one hand to steady the metal edge of the lid--hot hot hot--as I tried to wedge the handle under the screen's lip with my other hand.  Second, count the number of air holes in the silicone screen.  Then, count the holes in the metal mesh of the Cuisipro, or its ilk.  The purpose of a screen is to catch the grease, and this is the important part, to allow the steam to escape, otherwise the water vapor condenses back onto the food.  I first tried using the Tovolo to saute ground beef.  The beef began to stew in the water dripping from the surface of the screen.  Third, too much grease escapes around the edge of the screen because the metal rim bows from the heat.  In all fairness, the mesh type bows also, but not as much, possibly because the edge is thin and more pliable.  This product, imo, is just one more silicone kitchen gadget that does not work as well as the metal version. Save your money and buy the old fashioned kind.  
 Ever read a newspaper article to find half of it is taken up by useless information? e.g. "Dr Kenith E. Browner (MBA, BAS, winner of the 2002 SoandSo award, local Environmentalist, Graduated from Northern SS University with honors) says to bundle up this weekend."      ...     You just can't help to skim past it all.. Which brings me to Death Valley by Keith William Nolan. Half of this book is filled with useless info! Once in a while you get a little hint of a story, but then it jumps back into naming so many battalions, sergeants, lieutenants, soldiers, weapons, equipment, points...etc   You just can't visualize anything happening with all of this... well.... I don't know what it is. One thing I'm sure of is that I totally regret setting eyes on this boo 
 First of all I am a big fan of this band.  However, this CD left me greatly disappointed.  It is not immediate or catchy except for a few songs - that unfortunately, after a few listens, emerge as false hope - for they also leave a lot to be desired.  Even after repeated listens on my part in an effort to give it a chance to grow on me, it never did.  Maybe for comparison purposes you could say this album is of a similar vein to the self-titled 1992 effort King's X ... but not even in the ballpark.  Try Gretchen, Out of the Silent Planet, Dogman, or King's X for their best.  I even liked Bulbous and Manic Moonlight, but this one is summed up in one word ... DUL 
 I puchased this book, in addition to many other telecom books and found this to be one of the worst ones.  Not only is the information useless it is written in a diffucult to understand fashion.  I recommend that you do not waste corporate money of this book 
 Though Mr. Steyn does have strong opinions and some good observations, his judgements are tainted by an anti-gay bias (he titles one chapter "The Fags", and it's not meant affectionately).  His readings of stories such as the reaction of Lorenz Hart upon hearing "Oklahoma" in a blackout could have been better informed by further research, and he repeats Lerner's silly comment about Lorenz Hart being to short to be heterosexual so he had to turn to men.  The book is also dated in many respects including the waning influence of British Operettas and the public's acceptance of Stephen Sondheim.  Rather than this book I would reccommend anything by Ethan Mordden or Martin Gottfried 
 The Sluggers Club is an okay book, but I think it is pretty boring. It has an exciting beginning and ending though. Most baseball finds would enjoy it 
 I was very surprised that a lot of peole thought that this book was bad.I thought that the book was gripping but I guess that is just my oppinion. Even though the book had absolutley nothing to do with basketball I still thought it was a pretty good book. But not as good as 5 star 
 Some interesting lists mixed in with a lot of either fanboy or totally confusing lists of top fighters, etc. with little actual merit makes this a very hard book to get into 
 some explanation.  I am having this terrible time of getting past the first few pages of this book.  So help me those of you who own refrigerators.  If you, or some unknown enemy, shuts down your "at work" fridge late on Saturday, and you for some unknown and bevildering (but deep, yeah deep and unfathomable) reason wake up at 4 A.M. on Sunday to go to work, do you think that at 6 A.M. you wouldn't be able to enter your workplace because of the PUTRID stench from your perishables?  I don't know about you but one of my problems with my fridge is the time it takes to thaw before I clean it.  Never, ever, has it made my food putrid in less than 12 hours.  And for some reason, I don't know why, I thought that fridges were as close to airtight as you could get, you know, to hold in all that cold air you pay electricity bills to produce.  FOR CRYING OUT LOUD WHY NOT MAKE IT A WEEK or better yet, a month.  And will somebody explain also why the author hates her sleuth so  much she makes her dumb enough to wake up at 4 A.M. to go to work when she clearly has not enough to do.  I mean Goldy gets knocked out, calls the police, calls Tom, calls Marla, goes in and cleans up her catering place while simultaneously getting rid of dozens of mice AND MAKES UP A WHOLE NEW BATCH OF LUNCH FROM BEGINNING TO FINISH.  If she had time for all that, why not wake up at 6 A.M.? I hate stupid books and this one makes it to the top of  the list.  However, I will get past page 20 if somebody explains to me why the laws of physics and common sense don't apply in America 
 Some say everybody loves a mystery, but this book wasn't supposed to be one. It struck me as a buffoonish rant by an unbridled ego gone wild. The book's logic was so wildly disconnected as to leave me wondering exactly where the author was ultimately headed. The real mystery was whether or not someone could truly pontificate for two hundred pages without saying something of substance. The problem was that if there was any value in what was being said, it was masterfully disguised in a shroud of name-calling, racism, and non-sequitur. It was a pompous diatribe rooted in such shallow thinking that any reader with a hint of common sense runs aground long before arriving in port - wherever that was supposed to be.  In this work of art, all those who disagree are evil "liberals", even Bush! If the world were truly as black and white as this uneducated and vitriolic assault on the spirit of humanity, it might be a worthwhile read. However, you'd get more out of reading "The Chronicles of Pee Wee Herman". The book's greatest merit would be as a study guide in a seventh grade class on the fallacies of logical thought.  Newscasters are renown for having big voices, huge egos and pretty faces. Deep thought is not normally something associated with these "readers of the wire". This book presents no evidence to the contrary.  If there is to be another effort by Mr. Hayworth, I'd suggest more substance and less simple-minded name calling and chest pounding. If the rest of the world is as dumb as he paints it, we're all in trouble. He reminds me of the under-achieving student in the back of the class throwing tantrums to to call attention to himself. Try studying more and talking less. 
 This slim volume is a hodge-podge of information about Asheville that is poorly organized and written in an affected style that makes it difficult to glean useful information.  The maps included in the book are inadequate and are more akin to something drawn on the back of a paper napkin than what one would expect from a published guide.  Photographs included in the book are of very poor quality, and sadly do little to enhance the quality of the book.  The book specifically excludes B&B's and other possible lodging accommodations, which is intentional on the authors' part but seems a major omission in a book with such ambitions.  Asheville's proximity to exceptional outdoor recreational opportunities is one of its biggest draws, but the authors do a very poor job describing them. [... 
 I never received this item, I put the wrong address for delivery and the sender said they never got this back. It is in limb 
 Don't bye thees. They don't look like orginals. They are really small, so it looks like glasses for children!! It's just waste of mone 
 I'd seen Shimizu's "The grudge" and so my expectations were pretty high on this supernatural horror film.   It's nowhere near the scariness or originality of the grudge but that bein said, it's not too horrible as far as japanese horror flicks goes these days. The trailer was actually a lot scarier than the actual movie.   The special FX are probably better than other stuff I've seen recently in b-type movies.  Bottom line, I was expecting much more out of this 
 I saw the "Young" part.  I even saw the "Black" part.  But "Gifted"?  My God!  This was such a waste of time in my busy life.  I can't believe I was subjected to read such boring nonsense.  If you're thinking of reading this book, DO NOT.  You would have more fun  being dead 
 A pamphlet would have accomplished what this guy said in the entire book!  I wanted to strangle him!  Repetitive, condescending, overly simplified and so BOOOoorrring!!!  Here is the nuts of it all:  Pick a stable stock with a narrow spread between bid and ask.  Buy 2000 shares and then sell it 1/16 higher right away.  Everything else is simply preamble... over and over and over.  Hope I saved you 20 bucks 
 Yes, it's about "good fellas."  Yes, it's peopled with alumni from the "Sopranos" (weakly cracking wise).  And there are too many requisite bullets-to and through-the-head cinemagraphic moments.  The plot is pretty weak - the downloading of money from a satellite requires a great deal of imaginative assent - the development of the story is uneven, and the acting is transparently bad on not just a few occasions.  Still, the actor-writer-director, Provenzano, shows flashes and this would have been a very good end-of-college project for a cinema student.  (Is that what it was?)  What you have to like about it is what he tries to do, not dislike what he doesn't do.  Provenzano occasionally gives us - just now and again - the atmosphere of the NY-NJ crime-world, but these are far, far better than any portrayed in the "Sopranos."  The dedication to business, the rock bottom-line mentality, the utterly cold sides that appear inhuman, in short, the "other" side of the human coin are nicely revealed in some very chilling scenes.  Uncle ordering the death of his nephew's friends before his eyes;  Johnny Irish bashing heads or killing; the torture scene:  to paraphrase Tessio in "Godfather I," "nothing personal, just business.")  (Of course, it has been alleged that the members of the underworld carted away and sold much metal from the WTC towers in the immediate aftermath of 9-11. "Just business.")    Thus, there is none of that revolting soap opera component that is increasingly dominating the "Sopranos" has become.  (Indeed, the "Sopranos" jumped the shark many moons ago.)  So try this one on for size.  Sure, its production values are poor, some scenes are painful, you keep comparing to other Mafia-movies.  But there are some hidden gems for those who look.  (Yeah, I agree:  Johnny Irish was a good character.  The FBI guy, however, was agony to watch.)  Two stars for effort and for promise.  Serious cinema students should check out Provenzano's next 
 this was terrible - i tried getting my weave shaped like a helicopter for my prom, but it turn out looking like a melting ceiling fan. like in "Something About Mary," splooge would have been cheaper, and would have held bettah. 
 Conservatives will probably dislike it.  Liberals will find it a good, fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole.  I'm a liberal, so it was fun for me.  But have you noticed how the word "community" is becoming the new flashword among liberals?  "We are all in this together," says Mario, so we had better take care of ourselves.  Like Hillary Clinton's "It Takes a Village."  The use of "community" is like the use of "opportunity" by the conservatives.  Both are code words for points of view that, taken to their extremes, can be far more detrimental than helpful.  Americans ultimately prefer the middle.  Just remember that, folks, and no one will get hurt 
 I bought one of these last year, and put it up in our yard just five feet from the fence dividing our yard from the neighbor's yard.  This device completely failed to stop the neighbor's barking dog.  I could detect no effect whatsoever.  Save your money, and try something else.  I wish I could tell you what works, but we're still looking 
 This was the required text for a comparative studies course I took on Ancient China and if it wasn't for the help of my prof I would have been lost completely.  Even he said it was difficult to understand and he has been studying China for decades.  This book was simply a mess of facts.  The author should have worked more on the order of the content he was stuffing into this book.  I give it two stars because of the great images it provides.  But, at the end of the day, images will not teach you about China.  The author may have covered a variety of Chinese history and provided nice pictures, but it doesn't do any good if it is simply scattered over the pages.  I am a deans list student but not after this book.  A China lover would enjoy the overview but take some Tylenol with it.  
 I cannot imagine why a publisher agreed to publish this book.  Of the purported 166 pages of text, from page 69 onwards are the text of three speeches to Congress.  Of the 60 pages before that, every second page is a poorly reproduced picture.  The result is that there is only 30 pages of actual material, and those are written in large font.    The book stats show that there are 5647 words in total in this book - maybe enough for a first year tax essay, but he would have failed on content.  There is nothing to learn from this waste of paper.  It should have been 15 pages long and given away as a pamphlet.  Save your money.  
 -This spectacular piece of poop is about the three angels stopping a former angel from taking over the world or whatever. So the angels must stop her and whiles they're busy doing that they run into such amazing adventures like stripping for no reason and delivering lines so terrible they almost blew out my center speaker. In the incredibly predictable and crappy end they save the day and they all give us a constipated smile to suggest that they live happily ever after. Wow that has never been done before. I always thought that foolscreen DVD's were the worst thing to happen to cinema but it turns out I was wrong, that crown goes to the master filmmaker McG. How the hell he keeps getting his movies green lit is perhaps the greatest mystery since "why Paris Hilton is famous". I'm really glad that he dropped out of the new "Superman" movie and let the supremely talented Bryan Singer direct, because if he had directed it then "Batman Begins" would have been the first and only great DC comics movie.  -I really hate this movie. Usually there's something decent about every movie but this movie had NOTHING. Much like that dog poop "House of the Dead" this movie is devout of any form of entertainment what so ever. There are potholes so big you can drive a tank through them. Then there's the lines, my god this movie has pound for pound some of the worst dialog ever to invade my ears. Whoever was the DP on this movie needs to beaten severely because the look of this crap gave me a headache. The colors are so bright and so "look at me" that it causes nausea, and the lights are so heavy on the actors that their faces look like it has had too much make up applied to it.   -The fights are also incredibly stupid. You can tell that these women are on a wire so much that it borders on the idiotic. McG's attitude in this crap was that the angles can do anything, and that includes sliding under tables and doing cartwheels with a chair. Another thing that drove me insane is that these girls are suppose to be intelligent and yet they keep acting stupid in every scene that we see them in. There is one scene in which the angels must retrieve a key from a man and instead of waiting for him in a parking lot and knocking him down to steal the key, they instead opt to do a striptease and distract him. I'm sure some horny 14 year old may find that entertaining but if you're not horny, and 14 then you'll find it as pointless as everyone else did. The music is bland and the jokes go down faster than Jenna Jameson at work. If you look up deplorable in the dictionary you'll see a picture of this movie  -If you have a party and you want to clear out the room then pop this movie in and surely everyone will leave your house so you can clean up, but if you're not having a party and want to clear the room then please by all means avoid this with all your might. it is really dreadful and painful, kinda like my jokes 
 I ordered this from Amazon and they sent me the wrong book.  I returned the other and requested the correct one.  They could not provide it and instead offered me a partial refund.. 
 Bob Scheinfeld outlines an interesting and intelligent approach to the application of a universal spiritual principle in a secular context, namely how to build and benefit from a relationship with your Higher Self - or "your Inner CEO" as Bob puts it.  The strength of this material lies firstly in its language and style of presentation which successfully avoids any religious or "new-age" jargon, and secondly in its structured and systematic approach as to how to apply this principle.  My main criticism of this book is that it is positioned as the missing or secret factor that is required to achieve wealth and success. But, as Bob tells us on p185, "becoming successful in business or becoming wealthy may not be part of your mission or life purpose."   Throughout the book Bob stresses the critical importance of your "mission or life purpose" as the ultimate determining factor as to whether (or when) wealth and success will be achieved.   It would be more accurate and truthful (and ultimately more helpful to the majority of people who may not be destined for great wealth and material success) if the primary focus of the book was on how to establish and fulfill your personal "mission or life purpose". But perhaps that angle wouldn't sell as well...  However, I do recommend this book. Follow the steps and processes that are so clearly outlined and then use them to discover and fulfil your mission or purpose in life - which may or may not include wealth and material success!    
 I can only say that the effort was obvious but the information was hard to use.The research was solid but lacked common usage for slugs like me 
 When I bought the book I did not know that they already made a movie out of it but I learned about it later on. So I was really excited when I started to read it - also because other comments were really good. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all.  First the story development is really slow- it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens.  Second, several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly.  The worst part of the book though is its style: It does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime - he/she gets an extensive characterization. Most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader. Without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about 200 pages shorter.  But even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter, couldn't it still be an interesting book? Unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well. The detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than 100 pages. On top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is - and wonder why you need to go through over 200 pages to find out officially.  Conclusion: If you are a psychologist and/or like in-depth character studies this is exactly the right book for you. BUT for those of you who like fast-paced stories, ample twist and turns, surprises, action, thrilling developments and/or elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time. Please do not come anyway near it. Watch the movie instead - this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in 2 hours 
 I am a big fan of the show, and was disappointed that for so long, only a few episodes were available to purchase, and those were only on VHS. I was really happy when I heard they're releasing the complete series on DVD... but if you ask me, these DVDs are worse than having nothing at all.  The box advertises "complete, uncut" episodes and yet many episodes are missing scenes for no apparent reason. I can't imagine the reason for this. The DVD picture and sound quality are far worse than the VHS releases. How does that even happen? The episodes are also missing the introductions (which are different for each episode, depending on guest stars, etc)... left out for no reason. The DVDs also have no chapter stops whatsoever.  How does this happen in the modern day entertainment industry? No one in charge of product quality, no one even attempting to release something up to DVD standards, yet they hired someone to delete scenes that aren't crucial to the plot? I just don't get it... did they think DVDs have very limited space, and they have to take any steps necessary to reduce the length of the show?  The Little House series still appears on cable TV. You can literally get a much better quality product simply by taping the shows off of TV... this DVD release is a joke.  It's a bit frustrating to see so many shows (including older shows and less popular ones) are having great DVD releases, with great quality video and sound, and actor commentary despite the show being made decades ago... and then to see that Little House is treated so poorly 
 This book had no focus, was choppy, and really doesn't help you to understand Iran - if anything, it confuses you even more.  The first half of the chapters is the story of Ali Hashemi, a young Iranian boy who studies at a madreseh and eventually becomes a prominent mullah in the town of Qom.  Not fantastic, but that part's okay.  What kills the book is the second  half of the chapters: a sloppy, unfocused, confusing, rambling account of Iranian history.  The book goes into such detail on some aspects of Iranian history (for example, providing detailed biographies of historical figures) that you can't grasp the overlying structure.  This detail would be fine in a purely nonfiction book on the history of Iran, but coming in a book with such a jumbled format, a general synopsis would have been more appropriate. The history portion attempts to relate to the previous "fictional" portion of the chapter, but in doing so the history isn't presented in a clear chronological order, leaving you befuddled as to what's happening when.  I had to read this book for a class and it was very painful.  Don't read it if you don't have to - stay far away 
 If a story doesn't hook by the middle of Chapter 3, there are other books to open, books that kick in by PAGE 3, thank heaven. I bought TIME BOMB because the reviews on the jacket made it look fast and thrilling. I could not even finish chapter 3. I'd read something once by Jonathan Kellerman that made me remember him as a reliable author of great escapist fiction. I can't remember what it was.  *sigh* I don't see where these rave reviews are coming from. The book is so boring.  Also, the racist meanies I saw lurching up over the horizon, as well as being hackneyed and ho-hum, were unrealistic. Even the meanest harshest republican white adult male doesn't picket a school in a high income neighborhood shouting "wetback" and "greaser". Not even in wacky California, I shouldn't think. 
 There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the "wisdom" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.  She should have based her book on real Aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population.  That way readers would not believe the lies she tells about Australia.  The book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling.  She should not be profiting from this book 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 Though I understand other reviewers' opinions of this book, and I agree that some of the book's ideas were interesting, The Lives of a Cell just didn't appeal to me. I have always loved science, but not in the way this book displayed it. I got extremely bored with this book and found myself skimming chapters. Lewis Thomas seemed like he was trying to sound too intelligent while getting his opinion across, where a simple explanation would have been much more powerful. Some may like this book, but I think there are much better reads out there 
 My son was on target in all of his milestones until I bought this toy and the whole collection. He became obsessed with it He would not want to play with anything else and asked me to buy more and more Thomas toys. I made tests on him and he showed developmental delays.  Two child psychologists and two Occupational therapists told me that it is statistically common that children become too obsessed with this particular toy and they show developmental delays. Therefore, I got rid of all the thomas collection and my child is now again on track for his age. But It took me some time to correct his behavior with  therapies. I would not recommend this toy for any child. If your child gets too obsessed with it, discard it and do yourself a favor, do not buy the collection 
 I bought this title after looking and looking at many reviews for Italian cookbooks. I have made 5-6 recipes and cannot rave about even one 
 This book is so far from Krentz's best romantic novels (Grand Passion, Absolutely Positively), that I would have believed it written by some other romantic novelist because it was so predictable and boring.  The heroine has this "amazing" ability to tell where people have been murdered, but there is no way for her to use this ability to try to solve crimes & contribute to her husband's detective business.  Her husband is a private investigator who somehow manages to stay afloat financially, since he spends most of the book picking out color schemes for his home (Ochre or gold, ooh, the mystery!).  There are a couple of romantic subplots where friends of the couple who have previously been unlucky in love suddenly discover each other & decide that they're perfect for each other.  At the end of the book, you end up with a clumsily-plotted attempt to kill one character, a bunch of references to some nutty mental institution where two of the characters were held captive, three soppily happy couples dancing in the sunlight and one majorly bored reader who wishes she had picked another book for her weekend read 
 This book is simply awful. I gave up after a hard slog through ninety percent of this dreck. The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead 
 I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach.  The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating.  The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over.  What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking 
 Probably need a couple more listens, but my first few tries put me to sleep. I really like this genre of music, but somehow could not take to this album 
 This is a short book with wide spacing, large fonts, and many trivial examples.  To people who have read "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" or other references, this book offers nothing.  Reading the book is often uncomfortable.  The author is not funny, cute, expert, authoritative, or anything else that he tries to be 
 I read the preceding reviews and really question what I did wrong with this unit. I tried for 6 months to get this to work right and it never did. The ice cream would be too frozen to get to come out of the unit. even when I used it to make alcoholic drinks...it STILL froze up! (and alcohol is not suppose to freeze) Luckily, I had purchased it at Williams-Sonoma and even w/o a receipt, they refunded the purchase. I only wished it would have worked like it promised, it's an impressive unit and people would just look at it in awe but every time I used it, people would just be disappointed (especially me for what I paid for it!) Unless my unit was just defective, I will never know, but would not even risk trying to buy it again! It is a beautiful unit, but that alone is not worth paying $$$$ to have it as a pretty countertop decoration 
 that is, trite, predictable and mawkish.  The film "Billy Elliot" was a genuine delight in every way, possibly a masterpiece.  All I know is that it delighted me from start to finish. If a musical could be made from this situation and these characters (and why should it since the film is all about reticent characters' passions finding expression through non-verbal means of boxing,dance, etc)these songs demonstrate why it should not be done. You know in advance where every song will go: one for the instructor, one for the grandmother, one for Billy's cross-dressing friend. And there has to be a stale anthem for the miners, a song from Mum beyond the grave, a song to lamely describe how Billy feels when he's dancing...even a thudding number to Maggie Thatcher that celebrates Xmas as "one day closer to her death." Elton John's music is no worse than it ever is and features a flagrant steal from Les Miserables.  This score could have been spit out of a computer program.  It aims low and succeeds.  No wonder it's a hit! Better to have recycled Johnny Cash songs on Broadway than junk like this...we already have enough junk of our own (Spamalot, anyone?).   
 This version of the DVD promises on the cover that English OR English Closed Captioning is available. In fact, the menu provides only English with closed captions, with all the little sound descriptions like [water sloshing], [cattle lowing], [people muttering] which, while possibly useful to the hearing-impaired, are a constant irritation for a hearing, non-Swedish-speaking viewer. I'm returning this DVD and will wait 'til Fox gets their presentation right, in line with the features description on the case. Sheesh 
 When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame. 
 Ultimately, the flaw in Lessig's books is his belief that the revolution of personal computing and the internet are the products of intellectuals like himself.  Undermining the freedom and property rights of the programmers and companies who really invented these marvels is a profound threat to one of America's most vital and creative industries 
 If you expect this to play music by itself, you will be dissapointed.  Basically, each foot is a sqeeze horn.  It's not bad a plush but as a musical toy, it's horrible 
 You can come to any conclusion if you carefully omit the pieces of information that conflict with your intended outcome. That's what this book does. It's a good read if you're seeking to reinforce the comfort found in your beliefs. The author states that the virgin birth story is too weird to have been made up, yet virgin birth stories already existed at the time the biblical one was written (the stories of Apollonius of Tyana, Krishna and Mithras to name a few). Evidence clearly suggests that Christianity "borrowed" these concepts from much older religions. This type of information was omitted from this work, making it, in my view a very narrow study 
 Like others I was mislead by the false description given.  I waited to open the box til the 21st so that my daughter would not see it. I didn't realize til I took it out the packaging that it had legs and not a tail!  Now I have had to go to ebay and it's doubtful that it will be here by Christmas. Very disappointed in Amazon 
 This handlebar mount mirror was most disappointing. The adjustable mirror shaft has next to no memory and creeps into a position which is totally unusable. Don't risk your safety or your dollars on this product. It's simply not worth the inexpensive price 
 If any kid music annoys you, this CD is NOT for you.  These are good old classic songs, but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs.  I'm throwing it away.  I want my two-year-old to know the songs I know and love, but this was a bad buy on my part.  
 I was incredibly surprised at how negative this book was about dissertation completion.  The last thing someone needs when starting out the process of writing a dissertation is reading about how many people never complete their work.  A how-to book should be encouraging not discouraging.  There are plenty of other books available that explain the process while leaving this authors cynicism at the door 
 It would not download; it just stopped about 1/4 the way through.  I will have to send it back 
 Unfortunately the pet blinker didn't hold up very well.  I think a washer fell out or something but the unit came apart after day 1 
  Some movies are not be remade. This remake does not have the creepy settings or lighting of the original. The cast stinks.  Why did they change the story? It is too wishy-washy. If you want to see better acting, creepier settings, and a music score that will scare you, see the original 
 I got this book at the library (interloan) and I have to say this is dead last in financial self help books.  If you have the time and inclination, by all means go ahead and read it...but I would recommend many books before this; Millionaire Next Door, Richest Man in Babylon,  Think & Grow Rich, How to Win Friends and Influence People, anything by William Nickerson or John T. Reed...or Stephen King for that matter.  Honestly, after reading 50+ books on financial freedom, this book has the dubious distinction of a singular 'a-ha' moment; I realized that if this guy can write a book like this - anyone can.  In short, don't bother...the 3 hours it takes from your life would be better off with your kids, your pets, or your dentist (come on - you know you need it).  Alternatively, buy it yourself.  If for no other reason that encouraging the author in you (but please don't take my word for it)

 i could only read half an hour of this. ive read over a dozen guides in this vien. dont waste your money 
 I, along with several others from my adult and aging class, purchased this book because we were under the impression that it was actually the BOOK. We were all excited that we were saving about $100 dollars to buy this book from you.  The picture shown was the exact same as the book that is required for the course. It wasn't mentioned that it was a workbook to accompany the text book.  For future buyers, maybe you should change the picture to the book you are actually going to sell people so you don't fool them as you did my class 
 I must be the only one who didn't think this book was wonderful. The story was nice. I enjoyed the excepts from the 14th century journals. The characters were all right. But Ms. Mitchell's writing kind of set my teeth on edge. It seems that the only thing she ever details are the clothing that everyone is wearing! Instead of just saying, "I went up to my room and changed into black pants and a sweater" she takes up entire paragraphs with descriptions like "I went upstairs and changed into slim, black pants and a black boatneck, high brand name sweater and black shoes that my late husband had purchased for me when we went to Switzerland."  She describes Cranwell's clothing obsessively - rust colored courduroy pants, gray courduroy pants, brandy colored turtleneck sweaters that brought out the color of his eyes.... I was beginning to believe that he was gay. It's not that I don't care what everyone is wearing, I was just getting tired of every single situation that these characters found themselves in being bogged down in the details of their clothing! Surely there are more important things in a story like this than the fashion!  As for the story, well, it's typical Christian fiction with different characters and a different setting. What I wouldn't give for some Christian author to break the mold and be daring enough to have their characters do something bold! Instead, the two main characters of 'Chateau', Freddie and Cranwell, do very little except debate theology in the kitchen, cook and take walks. The so-called 'intrigue' on the back of the book is Freddie's assistant, Severine's erratic behavior and obsession with finding a lost artifact that proved the chateau's mistress was Jewish. Freddie starts to notice that little things in her home are coming up missing or being moved in a strange way. That's not intrigue, it's an annoyance. It's also boring. I noticed that someone described this book as historical fiction. It's not. The excerpts from the 14th century journal are, but the story is not. It takes place in modern time, and aside from the fact that takes place in a castle and one of the characters is writing a historical novel, there is nothing 'historical fiction' about this book.  As I started to write this review, I almost liked this book. I was going to give it three stars. Now that I've considered it a little longer, I've come to the conclusion that I really didn't like this book at all. Sorry to all you readers out there who gave it five stars and thought it was wonderful historical fiction, but I didn't think so. I know you will all probably say that this review isn't helpful and whatnot in anger against my opinion, but that's your opinion. This is how I honestly feel about this book. When I finished it last night, I was half convinced that it was okay, but not great. Now, I really know that I didn't like it, and this book will definitely be in my next garage sale.  L 
 I really don't understand what all the hype is with this band. They are mediocre at best 
 If you wanna learn about ranger history after 1974, there is a lot of basic info in here. If you wanna learn about anything before 1974 - go somewhere else. The history of the ranger up to 1974 is compressed into 100 pages and I found one MAJOR mistake - the author claims that the 2nd ranger bn was not the first unit on top of point du hoc, he claims that the 116th reg of the 29th infantry was there first. He even quotes a section of stephen ambrose's "D-day" to back it up, only he quotes from the chapter about the 5th rangers and the 116th at Omaha. If he made a simple mistake like that one, how do I know that the rest of the book isnt filled them? All in all, I'm glad I got this book as a gift, because it isnt worth the money.... 
 I found The Whole Woman more antagonistic and needlessly controversial than enlightening. Greer makes it quite clear that there is exactly one feminist left on the planet, and she is it.  I'm hard-pressed to think of any third-wave feminists who live up to her standards. To do so, you would have to be an earth-mother living in a separatist commune with her lesbian lover. There's nothing wrong with that lifestyle, but it's not one to which most feminists would aspire. It's not one to which I aspire.  Also, it's as limiting a construction of womanhood as the patriarchal one she deplores. What do you do if you are heterosexual? It's all very well for her to say that you can reconstruct yourself as a lesbian, but that's as insulting as the implication that homosexuals just need to try hard enough and they can be heterosexual.   In a similar vein, I found her views of men particularly unpleasant. She suggests in no uncertain terms that they're all potential adulterers, rapists, child-abusers, wife-beaters, misogynists, etc . . . etc . . ., and that any woman who wants an equal, non-exploitative relationship had better become a lesbian. It's hard to see it as anything but pure slander, backed up by the flimsiest of anecdotal evidence. Just because you can cite a few cases of sickos who get turned on by their baby daughters in their nightgowns does not mean that all fathers will inevitably turn to abuse.   The rest of the book is no better. It's very poorly researched and argued, and parts of it verge into the insane. She seems particularly taken with the idea of "primitive" women as whole women, because they aren't bound by Western concepts of femininity. What she doesn't mention is that those women experience the same oppression that Western feminists fought long and hard to overcome. They might not wear bras or high-heels, but that doesn't make them any less oppressed by patriarchy. It seems obvious to me that women from tribal societies do not generally have much real political power, but are doomed to bear lots of children and die young. When she does look at the appalling aspects of those societies, she puts a positive spin on them. There's even a section where she seems to defend female genital mutilation.   Also, I can imagine that some of her ill-informed views are extremely offensive to people in those situations. She describes IVF as patriarchal appropriation of and interference into the process of reproduction. Similarly, she suggests that women who don't opt for natural childbirth (without anaesthetic, of course) are allowing men to remove them from the process. It's utterly disrespectful of the choices women may choose to make, not because they've internalised their oppression but because inseminating themselves with a turkey-baster seems vaguely ludicrous or because they don't want to experience agonising pain.  It's been a while since I read a feminist book that made me angry and this one does so for all the wrong reasons. It makes me embarrassed to call myself a feminist. 
 I've had only two reactions from this book: falling asleep or laughing. Repressed Regardie is far from my favorite author, or any useful author in particular; I've only found his works, "The Golden Dawn" and "A Garden of Pomegranates" to be mildly useful. "Tree of Life" seems to be one long, drawn-out, arrogant criticism of other practices, and indeed other magicians. The information is exceptionally watered-down and seemingly copied from his superiors in the Golden Dawn (namely, Aliester Crowley, who is a "lesser" to him). Armchair magicians don't have much purpose in general, and Regardie certainly falls easily into that category 
 Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.  I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1 
 I bought this album thinking it would be good, because every review I read gave it 5 stars. SO I thought "Why not?" and bought it. I put it in the cd player, and was immediately dissapointed. The first thing I noticed was how terrible the sound levels were. It sounds like it was recorded in my garage, everything is way over-saturated and the drums are mic'd terribly. You can't even tell what's going on half the time, which isn't saying much, because there is nothing very interesting happening in the guitars. So I listened a little longer, thinking "it has to get better, maybe they'll add some symphonic stuff or something, considering this was reviewed to be some sort of black metal masterpiece." I was wrong of course, as the first track remained pretty stagnant, as did the next, and the next track etc. assumed that the frontman MUST be a good singer, considering his howl is absolutely laughable. Once again, bad sound levels come in to play here, even though not a whole lot could cover up how terrible this dude is.  Basically this album is not the black metal masterpiece it was hyped up to be. If you are into really bad prog metal with bad production, this album is for you. If you're not, steer clear of this album. it was the biggest waste of money I made this year 
 Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 this c/d is okay, but not worth purchasing, as i admit i didn't i just borrowed it. ruben's voice is good, but i agree with the others who said that you can hear as good or better in ANY black church. just now i saw a large black guy on the church channel that had a 1000 times better voice. let me get one thing straight, YES, a lot of these 1 star rating posts ARE from claymates, but they are just getting even for what rubenites did from the moment you could purchase clay's cd, which they DIDN'T, and write a review, which they DID. i know that '2 wrongs don't make a right, but they sure are fun for revenge!' ; ) as for ruben, he and clay's friendship is very inspiring, as they came together as 2 shy misfits. too bad many rubenfans are so darn hateful, and many people who voted for ruben were just voting AGAINST clay more than anything else. oh, and IF you think the 'AI' Vote was legit, then you probably think George W. Bush REALLY won the presidency! (he DIDN'T, BTW, he stole it) an insider says that CLAY really had more calls, but when the company that ran it TOOK A SAMPLING of the votes, didn't count them all, RUBEN WON THAT! Clay was robbed, in part because he wasn't considered 'cool' or 'urban' enough. ruben was weighed recently for an 'EXTRA' makeover, and he hit the scales at 450 lbs, 100 more than he did on 'AI'! boy, talk about eating disorders from stress. thankfully, he has dropped 20 pounds on a diet but that is just chump change when you are that big. get on the ball ruben, maybe he needs to be in a hospital to be forced to stick to it. 
  If you are deeply concerned with what various second or third rate actors and television personalities  of 5 to 10 years ago did during the WWII, this is the book for you. Otherwise, this is a throw away.    The most startling new information provided in this book are that Prescott Bush was a Senator from Maine and that Winston Churchill was prime minister of the United Kingdom during the 1939 German invasion of Poland.  Of course, Prescott Bush was a senator from Connecticut, and Churchill became prime minister in the Spring of 1940 after the Anglo-French invasion of Norway was defeated by the simultaneous German invasion.     France and England did not really come to the "rescue" of Norway from a German invasion. They had planned  their own invasion of Norway at the same time as the German invasion.  They were delayed by several hours due to weather and claimed to be helping Norway against Germany. Paradoxically, Chamberlain fell because of the fiasco in Norway, and Churchill who was the architect of this disaster became prime minister! Of course, this is the kind of fact you are never told about the war, that someone like Wright could never tell you.  I expected to find such things in this book.   Mike Wright's ignorance and  the absence of any apparent fact checking by the publisher indicate that both are worthless as sources of serious information.       With no special knowledge or interest in World War II, Wright compiles a bunch of humorous or trivia-related vignettes about the war as he appears to do about as many subjects as he can publish books.     However,I feel sorry for someone like the author who believes people need to know how Swooze Kurtz--whatever she does???--got her name. I feel sorrier for someone who is bamboozled into thinking this is a book with new information about the greatest tragedy in human history.  A war in which scores of millions of people died and many countries laid waste deserves more than drivel like that!      With the opening of the archives of the old USSR and the GDR, all sorts of information that was not known before is available for a serious author who really wants to tell us things that we weren't told about WWII. I expected this kind of information when I purchased this book. Yet, Wright is oblivious to the fact the major segment of WWII in Europe was fought between the USSR and Germany and its allies.    His goal is to provide quick, entertaining, light reading on a subject that is neither quick, entertaining, nor light.      The copy editing and fact checking in this book is simply not professional.  While a bibliography which is useful is provided, there is absolutely no regular sourcing in this book, which may, in fact, be a tribute to adequacy of his sources, compared to the inadequacy of his history.  As somone who teaches college students to discern which books to use for research papers and which to avoid, I would advise people to avoid any book brought out by this publisher for serious research or reliable knowledge.       This book does have its moments. He gives an interesting blow by blow picture of the draft process when it was launched in 1941.  He also provides interesting information about the deportation of Japanese Americans and Canadians, and about German prisoners of war in the US.    However, though he condemns Japanese brutality to Allied prisoners, Wright is completely silent the attrocities the US and UK  perpetrated against Japanese soldiers who wished to surrender.  Allied policy was usally not to take Japanese prisoners, but to massacre them.  A grisly trade in Japanese sculls and gold teeth  sent back to the USA grew up during the War. This is the kind of fact about World War II that "They Didn't Teach You" that is light years away from anything Mike Wright knows.     For a better look check out "Why the Allies Won." For an even better set of information about the Pacific war that is NEVER TOLD consult War Without Mercy by John W. Dower which will tell you about Allied abuse of Japanese prisoners as well as Japanese crimes against other Asian peoples.       I found this book OK to read while I was sick in bed. I did not want anything demanding, although I must say that one driving factor in getting me to finish it was to see how many ignorances and errors the book contained. Like the one Harliquin romance I read under similar circumstances, I thought it was appropriate to throw the book away when I finished it.  It is unfortunate Amazon does not permit one to have 0 stars or negative quantites of stars.     
 This is a horribly written book, flawed by numerous instruction errors and miserable Quality Control and editing by the publisher. The premise and idea of this series is commendable, but as someone who teaches After Effects and Premiere, this was a sad experiment. I much prefer Adobe's Classroom in a Book, and I generally find much better third party titles than Adobe's. If possible, wait for more titles for the new version 6.5 to come out... authors will have had more time to catch up to the program than this particular volume 
 I've read all of 'Dr.' Leon Kass's books on bioethics. In a nutshell his stance on ethics is that he thinks it dehumanizes mankind. His line of thinking is strictly in the 'Religious Right' camp. I truly wonder how technologies such as stem cells (used to help people) is dehumanizing in any way. Leon Kass is Bush's Medical Theocrat. Technologies such as stem cells and cloning are not dehumanizing in any way. What can set up dehumanization is how we USE these technologies - not that these technologies merely exist or will exist. This book was intelligently written without any reference to religion but the whole underlying message was "Do not touch Gods property even if it means healing the sick." These religious fundamentalists will do anything to STUNT us in our pursuits of happiness. This guy is for KEEPING PARALYZED PEOPLE PARALYZED. "Dr." Kass is for KEEPING AMPUTEES AMPUTATED. He's for KEEPING the depressed and suicidal DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL. Ill spare you the bull and say what Dr. Kass really wants to say - "I want you to follow Jesus with all your heart no matter how much pain and suffering you are in. If God made you depressed than thats how you should be. If God made you paralyzed then thats how you should be. If you are miserable in your existance then thats obviously how God wants you to be and thats how you will be with our new conservative laws that will effectively ban progress to help people". For this is the ONLY real argument you can use to support the banning of progress designed to help humans. - He wants everyone to follow the 'divine' rule of sanctity of life, not quality of life - an ugly ethic for a very stupid man.  I guess people like this will keep the suffering people suffering indefinately 
 I don't regret having read this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already into Henry James.  The style is hard to understand, apparently because it was dictated, and the subject matter is even more obscure.  I don't think Henry James had much experience with children: even assuming that Maisie is twisted by her strange situation, she doesn't talk like any child I know or can imagine.  Weird moral undercurrents and jealousy take up most, if not all, of the novel.  I wouldn't take claims of this book's modernity too seriously - it's more on the byzantine side.  Read The Europeans instead: so much more fun 
 I read My Antonia and loved it so much that I consider it one of my favorite books.  And, that's why I really really really wanted to like this book.  But after giving it a chance for about 218 pages, I couldn't bear it any longer.  The problems I have with this book are as follows:  1) I understand the book's plot of the professor trying to find meaning in his life.  That's the book I was looking for.  The problem is that the Tom Outland character does not get you there and most of the text of the book is on this character.  2) Which brings me to my biggest gripe about this book, and Cather in particular.  Cather cannot, to save her life, write a believable male character.  Tom Outland is supposed to be an orphaned boy turned cowboy around the turn of the century, but Cather managed to make him out to be so unbelievably feminine that I found myself in wonder at how little she knows about men.  She holds Outland out to be the hero of the story, the inspiration behind the Professor's motivation.  That's fine, but if I'm supposed to conclude the Professor part of the story, then I have to buy Outland's character and it's just not possible.  Here are some examples of Cather not being believable:  a)  When she describes Tom Outland's hands through the professor's eyes, she describes them as beautiful and delicate.  Worse still, she bothers to describe them in detail.  Men don't do that.  b)  Around page 218 when she begins Outland's tirade against Blake she makes Outland sound off like a nagging wife about how Blake shouldn't have sold the pottery etc.  Men don't argue this way with friends; they don't have hissy fits - they stay quiet!  c)  After the argument in (b) above, as Blake leaves the scene, she describes Outland wishing to run after him and hold him in his arms.  Men just don't think like that.  d)  When Outland is in Washington D.C. trying to get people to take interest in the pottery he discovered, he lets himself get ignored, disrespected, and he waits by tolerantly while being stepped on by people in positions of power.  That's not a description of a turn of the century orphaned cowboy; that's a description of a turn of the century well-to-do woman of society - the only world Cather appears to know.  e)  Whenever Tom Outland meets other men in his life as a cowboy, they are always really "nice and pleasant".  Indeed they are overly accommodating.  Huh?  I could see cowboys being really respectful and accommodating to a beautiful woman of society (like Cather) but an orphaned cowboy?  She just puts too much of herself in this character.  I couldn't buy it.  3) Now before reviewers think my gripes are based on some sort of homophobia, let me just say that if it had been a story about men in love with each other, I would have accepted that as at least being believable.  But that's not Cather's intention.  Outland ends up marrying the professor's daughter.  Is Cather trying to send out a bisexual message of some kind?  Was the professor gay?  The text just does not support any kind of homosexual message either explicitly or implicitly.  4)  Cather plays out Outland to be this super human being.  Indeed he is the inspiration to the Professor and all the other characters in the book.  But if that's the case, why is he on the wrong side of the moral debate on the Dreyfus affair?  Cather wrote this book in 1925; twenty five years after all the facts had already come out on that case and yet Cather has Outland take the side of bigots?  5)  In Outland's tirade against Blake, Outland chews him out for selling ancient pottery belonging to native Indian tribes.  Earlier in the book it's concluded that the tribe was decimated by outsiders.  In chastising Blake, Outland declares that Blake was wrong to sell the pottery because it was not his.  He says that the pottery belongs to his country, to the State etc.  That's the best our hero can do?  Wouldn't the right thing to do be to leave the ruins to themselves and not dig up the belongings of the decimated people - i.e. let them rest in peace?  Anyway, I was sorely disappointed.  I gave The Professor's House one star more than it deserves only because My Antonia deserves six. 
 Positives about this book is that, unlike other books which offer "cure", nowhere does Null states or implies that the book is intended to cure or eliminate any sort of disease or illness, besides that aspect, the book is largely disappointing. Unfortunately much of the information contained here can be found on the Internet, but there are several problems as well.  In certain illness or diseases he can state up to 30-50 possible herbs/vitamins (which can be confusing at times). The problem is that for some of them he is reluctant to tell you the appropriate dosages to take. Secondly, there side effects, for example; take 200 B6 over the long run can cause nerve damage, which brings up the next point, which he is reluctant to tell the precautionary details of combining certain herbs and supplements, which can be toxic and deadly. You can't just tells the reader, take this take that, and not tell them what might happen. For example he recommends Echinacea, for cancer, and CTS, and other health problems, but in certain cases Echinacea has been known to cause, liver inflammation, kidney failure, or irregular heart rate. That just one example of many herbs that can be toxic....  This is book that pretty much, I or you can make just by going to the library, and the internet searching for diseases and illness, but somebody who is scholar, and has PhD, should not take the short cut to make easy $$$, and just throw information, without and facts research. IN THE END YOU CAN'T DISTINGUISH THIS BOOK FROM WHAT YOU READ ON THE INTERNET, SO THAN YOU HAVE TO ASK YOU'RE SELF THIS QUESTION? WHY BOTHER BUYING IT.  P.S this absolutely not the "whole encoylopedia" of natural healing, he leaves out a few hundred other major disease/ilness. 
 I'm a big Sytx fan and have most of their studio albums so this collection isn't of interest to me.  But the omissions of Don't Let it End, Why Me and Love at First Sight prompted me to give this a poor rating.  I guess Anthology doesn't technically mean best of or greatest hits, but I hate when collections are put together and charting singles are left out.  I would recommend getting Greatest Hits and Greatest Hits Part 2 if you're just looking for a Styx collection 
 Not an easy read, kind of slow.  There is some good advice that we already know, but just don't utilize.  I still haven'r finished reading 
 This novel is set in vaguely modern Britain (the precise date would be a spoiler) and deals with a charater who discovers that his upstairs neighbor believes himself to be the Man in the Iron Mask, both of history and of  Dumas' novel.  The action follows the character's increasing involvement in  and frequent resistence to this madman's fantasy world.  Likewise the  character is drawn into the madman's family life. Without getting specific,  the novel is about the "cantagiousness" of madness.  This is a  serious issue, but this is a modern novel and is mainly interested in the  question for "effect" and not in any philosophical way.  It is  well-written, and those who want no more from a novel than literary  in-jokes and surreal effects should find it thoroughly satisfactory. For my  tastes (and I do like the surrealism of Borges and Kafka, for example) the  book did not seem to be about real people; nor had it anything interesting  to say about Dumas; nor anything interesting to say about the historical  Iron Mask. I came away from this book feeling that it had been a pointless  exercise 
 WELL I LIKE THEIR CD BUT I WAS DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE LIVE PERFORMANCES ON CDS WHERE EVERYONE IS CLAPPING AND SHOUTING. I LIKE THE VERSIONS WHERE THEY ARE IN THE STUDIO AND EVERYTHING IS PEACEFUL. I WOULD  HAVE MUCH PREFERRED THE STUDIO VERSION BETTER 
 "St. Elmo's Fire" is one of those movies that could have been better, should have been better and yet, it just wasn't. It featured an ensemble cast of THE young and hot stars of the 1980s, the so-called Brat Pack (well, everyone but Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who were spared this misstep).  Maybe this was supposed to be "The Breakfast Club - - After College", but while "The Breakfast Club" had characters, even stereotypical characters, that you could relate to, there is absolutely no one, with the exception of Emilio Estevez' character, that you care enough about to relate to in this film. The setting is not the John Hughes teen friendly Illinois, but Georgetown, where our bunch of Brat Packers have supposedly graduated from college.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, RIGHT.   Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is, Nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that Sheedy, in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that.  Andrew McCarthy is their mutual friend who knows what Nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for Sheedy (or maybe it's just the pearls?)  Emilio Estevez is a future attorney, working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on Andie MacDowell.  Mare Winningham is a dowdy, trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity, working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her.  She instead fantasizes about Rob Lowe, who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band, who has dropped out of school, married a white trash-y looking groupie, had a child with her and has now separated from her, and taking up with other groupies.  Demi Moore is the wild chick who works in international banking, has a serious coke problem, stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of Billy Idol.   Sounds promising, huh?  Well, in what is an early portend of the "Melrose Place" to come, Sheedy finds out what a dog Nelson is, dumps his ass, immediately jumps into bed with McCarthy, who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job; Estevez, after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there, travels to the snowy mountains to track down MacDowell and profess his love to her.  He finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed, he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home.  Lowe, in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere, takes Winningham's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus.  Moore, after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother, has all her furnishings repossessed, loses her job and freaks out. Not exactly "The Breakfast Club".   The real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves.  With the exception of Estevez' character, they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped.  Their every action, every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional.  Their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that. Winningham's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed Lowe around like a sick puppy, knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was.  And yet, she still gave her virginity to him.  Maybe if Winningham wasn't so bright, or she was a college freshman, it would be understandable.  But she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent. Lowe really had little to do with his role.  Maybe if he had played the role Nelson had - - as the roving Lothario, with Sheedy waiting at home, it might have gone over better.  With his too-pretty looks, it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him.  Nelson just doesn't seem comfortable and doesn't pull it off - -but maybe Nelson might have been better suited for the sax player. Moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems, mirroring her character - - but was later rehired. While the title song later become a minor hit, "St. Elmo's Fire" itself missed the mark.  
 Heck, why SHD I be sorry for you, Dan - you're sitting on a gold mine 
 The book is convincingly argued, but the recommended supplements had no effect on me whatsoever, even though the book says the effects appear within minutes 
 I have a word for Crissypoo in So. California, obviously you ARE NOT a Christian Scientist, and Know nothing about it!  Also ..UMMM.... where is YOUR proof that Mark Twain's Daughter was not healed by Mary Baker Eddy?    Really now before you start making assumptions why DONT YOU DO SOME MORE  RESEARCH!  The one reviewer with the lengthy review gives some very good  starters for research! Also look further in to Mark Twains writings 12  years after his bashing of Mary Baker Eddy where he writes HIMSELF about  the healing of his daughter by Mary Baker Eddy 
 One good song, of course "The sound of silence", and the studio version is far better than this one. I am not a fan of the genre as you might expect 
 I'm a long time BT fan, I know that some of the best bands in the world are ones that are able to reinvent themselves and sound nothing like they did 10 years ago and still sound great but this is not the case with BT and with this album. Simply put, this album is junk but I still hold on to the hope that they will improve with their next. If you're thinking about buying a BT album, get Travelers and Theives or Save his Soul, you will not be disappointed. This album is best forgotten. We will all miss you Bobby S 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 Full of details and illustrations, a really good book for those beginners who wish to know about swords and daggers. Very Good 
 I bought this belt a while ago but could not use it, because I have no idea what gel I should get for it. It says a water based gel or water. Water definitelly does not work. Could anyone tell me specifically what gel I need and where I could buy it?  Ignore my rating since I did not actually used the belt. Thank you 
 I was very disappointed in this book. I found it tedious, rambling, and disjointed. There were a few interesting facts thrown in for good measure, but you have to slog through so much drivel that the trip just isn't worth your time.  
 The book attempts to be more that an architectural history and fails miserably.  They tried to use architecture as a way of intertwining the political and social history of the city.  Needless to say, this type of  scope is best in the capable hands of Robert Caro.  In addition to the  wooden text, the photographs, while rare, are uninspiring.  The publisher  produced a well-bounded book, so the most useful place for it would be on a  coffee table 
 I wanted to like this book. However, I found the writing very droll. I just couldn't feel the emotion, the ideals, the "rapture" of the subject matter. Instead, the book is bogged down in endless and pointless biographical details...this person did this, and then this, and so on. Maybe I'm not giving it the benefit of the doubt, but there are other books on transhumanism I found far more interesting, informative, and readable 
 I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.  If I had been in a book store and could have read a page or two I would have known immediately it was not the type of book I would read.  I'm sure it's wonderful for those who like it.  I passed it on to a friend 
 Before reading this book I did some research into what books would be good on gaining historical backgrounds and perspectives on the Middle East, terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism.  Over the past six months I have been obsessed with learning more about these subjects and how they play a part in the global community.  By reading the reviews on here I really thought this book would be very insightful in learning about the "enemy."  Like Sun Tzu says "know your enemy...know yourself".    I have to say I was tremendously disappointed with this book.  Not only was the writing egregiously pretentious, it was, at times, subconsciously sympathetic to its subject matter, which I found disturbing.  At first, I thought this was the author's modus operandi in conveying the "enemies" points for "jihad".  However, as I continued to read the book my suspicions were confirmed  What disappoints me the most is the author's lack of intellectual honesty when discussing Osama Bin Laden and conveying his objectives.  What the anonymous author fails to write in his conclusions is that Bin Laden is nothing more than a hypocrite.  Bin Laden criticizes the West for supporting oppressive regimes in the Middle East, when Bid Laden himself supported the oppressive regimes of Sudan and the Taliban, practices Wahabism which oppresses its believers in the name of saving them from modernization, not to mention the human rights violations pressed upon women, and previously supported Iraq, which was in turmoil because of an oppressive regime, not totally on UN sanctions.  When Bin Laden gives interviews to Western journalists he demands he has the questions ahead of time and there are no follow up questions.  You can draw your own conclusions to this.  The author continually states that Bin Laden is a man of pure faith and is misunderstood, and that basically most of the other experts in this field are wrong and he is right, which he picks right up on his next book Imperial Hubris.  In actuality, Bid Laden is no different than any other dictator.  He may not be an actual head of state but he uses propaganda to breed nationalism like most.  Bid Laden may seem like a soft spoken, faithful man, but he and his lieutenants do nothing more than use the despondent Muslim youth to fulfill their objectives and so called "prophecies".  If Bid Laden claims to be a faithful man of Islam, believes in martyrdom, and says he has lived to long, then why doesn't he hijack a jetliner and fly it into a skyscraper?  Or why doesn't he strap a bomb to his body and blow up an embassy?  Instead, he would rather hypnotize and tempt other Muslims into wasteful deaths, with thoughts and dreams of "paradise" and 72 waiting virgins.  It doesn't take an expert to figure that out.  I'm just glad I didn't buy this book and got it from the library.  
 Clearly this book was written to shock and disgust the reader.  It largely succeeeds.   The overriding weakness of the book is that all the characters basically act, sound and view life in the same way. After reading a couple dozen pages I noiticed that you could simply insert the name of one male charater into the place of another and not really notice any difference.   All the men are ignorant, physically abusive and shiftless drunks (of somewhat varying degrees).  (...)  I wonder if this work would have been more interesting if Selby took one of the stories in LEB (...say..."Strike"...) and provided more depth about the character's history and motivations.   This work suffesrs from the same fatal flaw as Richard Wright's "Native Son" (although a much different work): the main character(s) is (are) simply unlikeable and repellant; the reader has no reason to care what happens to them.  
 One of the best pieces of rock ever recorded, one of the worst reissue I ever heard. Do not buy this Japanese import! If you know what this album is suppose to sound like then you will want to cry when you hear Sony's butchering of this reissue. I am not being over critical here, this mix will make you cringe, or maybe we are just getting spoiled by Rhino's superb job? It's a cryin sham 
 It took me so long to read this book. This book was a total waste of time. 
 i dont like it the movie is much cooler then the cd ok 
  . . . and more nonsense.  Like I've stated in previous reviews, the only reason I read any of this c**p is because as a professional Christian educator and theologian, questions about stuff like this come up far more often than I would like -- and I've gotta have my ammo ready.  Here we go again:  Dispensational pre-millinalism, which is the theology presented in the book as "authentic" Christianity, was invented out of whole cloth in the mid 19th century.  This is not the faith of the Apostles.  This is not the faith of the Early Church (East or West).  This is not the faith of the Reformers.  Luther and Calvin would have rejected this.  This is not the faith of the Great Awakening.  Wesley and Whitfield would have rejected this.  Even in Protestantism, this represents a minority "out there" viewpoint.  A non-Christian who picks up one of these books and believes that it represents mainstream Christianity will be grossly deceived.  This is not honest theology; this is not honest biblical interpretation; and the writing is horrible to boot 
 Well Mobb Deep is another example of trying to make a comeback.  They had their classics with The Infamous and Murda Musik   Now they hope to hit it big with G-Unit on their debut Blood Money, but after a listen I'm wonderin to myself where's the old Prodigy and Havoc?  There are some flashes on here like on the forumlatic lead single "Put Em In Their Place" and "The Infamous" which takes you back to when the pair was at their best on classic albums like The Infamous and Murda Musik.  However you can tell that Mobb Deep is trying to go commercial at times with joints like "Let's Have A Party" and "Give It To Me".  Of course the formulatic problem with signing with G-Unit is on here: TOO MUCH 50 Cent.  It doesnt help when he goes to his routine of dominating the songs with doing his chorus on songs like "Creep", "Pearly Gates" and "It's Alright".  And there's the usual bling-bling track on here ("In Love With The Moulah").    Nothing else on the album really stands out here leaving fans with a not so good look on Mobb Deeps legacy.  And Prodigy really needs to work on his rappin style now.  Blood Money is just another example of rappers that have gone on the downslide going to G-Unit 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 Call me a glutton for punishment, but I read many of the I-Hate-The-Clintons trash that is published and is trotted out as serious reading.  (you would think that books like this one are written with crayon)   I do it to try to understand why a President who was responsible for giving this nation the longest sustained period of PEACETIME ECONOMIC EXPANSION, who headed a shrinking government, who reduced waste and left office with a balanced budget and a surplus as well, makes right-wingers HATE him so much.  Was it that he had the temerity to beat george h w bush, for the job of president?  Or, was it that republicans simply hate to see the American Dream realized?    IF you can read aldrich's book, and if you don't feel the need to be cleansed by holy fire in order to feel clean once more, then this is your kind of hate-book.    However, if you do have a soul and you don't want to sift through more lies than a fox news broadcast, try a book by Joe Conason, at least you'll be assured of truth and some A+ writing.    This aldrich fella should stick to writing traffic tickets and lying to traffic court judges....  Yes your honor, she was going 30 in the 20 mph zone......... very good mr aldrich, very good! 
 This is the 2nd one that I purchased since May.  The first one quit lifting & Toy r Us didn't have any more so I purchase the 2nd online & the rubber that makes it go is off both wheels & because it is now over 30 days I can not get another or an exchange.  My son loves playing in the sandbox with the toy but for the money it is not good I have not had one to last over a month yet. The toy has been broken for now 3 weeks so I average the life of the toy of the toy to be no more than a month at best.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS A WASTE OF MONEY! 
 The essays in this book aren't particularly enlightening; however, they are often misused not to start debate or critical thinking, but rather to show students "what they SHOULD learn and feel about the topics."  I didn't like any of the essays in this book because they didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.  I am already the product of a democratic, public education.  Thus, I am tolerant and accepting of others' views and opinions.  I don't need tolerance beaten into me over the course of a semester.  This book should only be used for the formerly home-schooled and religious right, as it will only open worlds for them.  In sum, this book is best used for what I can only assume it was originally intended - as a yule log.  My fondest memories of this book were in the burning of it after Christmas dinner in 1999.  Book burning is one human right not mentioned in any of the essays in this book - perhaps it should be 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 I liked the slicer okay...but the wire just snapped and I haven't had it but a few months 
 Strange to say, I did not like this novel nearly as much as her earlier work.  I usually find her narrative voice and her attention to detail charming and engaging, but here it bogged down and just became tedious.  There are no fully-drawn characters, only types, including the heroine (or should I say "hairoyne" -- from a motif in the novel) herself.  And, while I found the dilemmas of her earlier characters regarding marriage and identity quite moving, especially in "Another Marvelous Thing" and "Family Happiness," I found Geraldine's crises to border on the selfish and self-absorbed.  Who knows what might have followed this swan song?  For all of that, I do love Colwin, and I still cook from her cookbooks 
 I would recommend staying away from this product and company.  The USB1.1 driver shipped with the product and the latest driver downloaded from the support website both produce the same error while installing on 3 different Windows XP SP2 boxes. 
 I got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch.  After wearing Invicta's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist.  When I received it, I noticed the small scratches all over the crystal.  Nothing deep, but they really pick up the glare.   Atomic signal, I am unable to get it to pick up one.  In Memphis, TN, I think I should be in range, and all my atomic clocks sync up fine.  I have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house.  Still no good.  Basically I spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight.  Lesson learned 
 "Dog Days" isn't interesting for its characters or the plot, which is chick lit meets roman-a-clef political satire.   Indeed, the best parts of the book come from a few lines where the characters observe life in Washington for the political/media elite.   For example, one character had a great take on why 40-year-old men in DC date twentysomething interns. Another describes what a Washington cocktail party is REALLY like. Later in the book, another character muses on the effectiveness of President Golden (read: Bush) "pushing Mom, flag, apple pie, pickup trucks and mortgages" during his re-election campaign.   "There's a whole generation of young people who live a life based on absentee parents and McDonald's vegetarianism, credit card debt and one-night hookups," the character says. "They're entering the professional class now and their mores and norms will define the new middle class."  This remark would have made a more interesting essay to read than passing dialogue in a novel. I think this book would have been better if the author threw out the fiction and stuck to full-length essays in the style that made her noteworthy in the first place.      
 I gave the money to the cashier and its like she handed me a piece of crap !!!! I only bought this CD for my IDOL collection !!! I haven't listened to it since I bought it last year !!!  This cd is just horrible !!! Ruben doesn't need to be singing songs like " WHAT IS SEXY " anyways...thats just comical!!! HE IS THE WORST IDOL YET...AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE...FANTASIA? AN IDOL!!! They are both so horrible !!! Ruben Studdard is so bad...and that is the reason he is fallen into the category of " hasbeen "...maybe he can be on VH1's " Surreal Life ". Ha Ha!! 
 I would not recommend this poem book to people unless they like reading this type of poetry, or poetry in general.  While I was reading these poems, I found it very hard to concentrate on the poem I was reading, because the poems didn't really catch my interest.  I don't think I would enjoy reading another poetry book bye Edgar Allen Poe because I don't really like his type of poetry.  My mind wandered a lot while I was reading Poe's poems because they weren't exciting, they were sad, scary, and gloomy 
 Well I have tried to write a review for this book three times now and I write and then it gets posted and taken off - people don;t wanna har what i have to say becasue they think it is not good for sales - but I read the book - I was given it as a gift - i couldn;t afford to throw good money away on a book like this but some one else did and gave it to me.  What I have said was that this book made me angry.  I haev had hard times - been in rehab, in half-way houses, tried to clean up my life so many tiems and fallen back into unhealty habits - i was abused by almost eveyone I ever met - from friedns and neighbors to fmaily and ministers.  I was rteated like nothing and I believed it of myself - i got hooked on okycontin and then nethdone- the stuff that killed anna  nicole - but I found my way out.  i like to paint and to draw and so a friedn  - my sponsor - gacve me this book.  Now I don;t know about you, but I am a working woman - currently holding down three jobs just tryng to make the ends meet - and I don;t have time to take walks and go havea  nice cup of tea at the salon or listen to the birds hum.  i don;t have time to spend hours filling out surveys about what holds me back - life holds me back - and my jobs and my addictions- but I still manage to daw and paint and sell them for a little profit.  This book is for people who think they want to be an artist - but woudl rather fill out forms and write in a journal and complain abot why they can;t create nothin.  I paint or draw instead of picking up a pipe or knocking myself out with percoset and drowning in my tub.  If i had unlimited time and resources I woudl use this book but if I was a normal person I don;t think you will have any time.  i hope this sees the light of day - i have eben held down too long and i won;t take it anymore.  And maybe it si just me but just casue she had a bad mariage to a famous hollywood director she thinks she has been thorugh it - how about a marriage to a man who tried to set you on fire casue he was sky high on windowpane 
 So many people have written glowing things about this book, but I don't know why.  I think that I am becoming too practical and logical as I mature, so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness.  I think that the writing was well-done, but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value.   Either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel.  I didn't see why I should ever want to read it again, or have read it at all.  It is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers, so they looked all pretty and still alive, but still, the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer.    About the only thing I got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence.  I assume that I am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer, but still thought it was rather a waste of my time.  
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 What the world needs is another book by someone valueless and elitist.   Here it is.  A story told by the woman who brought bourgeois society to the  White House while people were starving all over the world.  I guess since  she doesn't eat, she thinks nobody else need to either.  One of the worst  people of the twentieth century talking about one of the darkest times of  the twentieth century, Reagan's Presidency.  Goes to show that even a  hatemonger can find the perfect mate.  Hey, does anybody know if Eva Braun  ever wrote a memoir 
 What a waste of $$, a book that uses a motorcycle brand name as though it was a generic term and is boring on top of that.  One good thing, this book shows that anybody can get any trash published 
 The trust a young reader places in a writer is something to appreciate and value. Many young readers have been following this promising series for several years and have paid the writer with their return through a dozen books and waiting for the conclusion to this saga. The writer has commited the ultimate betrayal to his young readers in delivering this last book. The book is poorly written and reveals a very undisciplined writer. Perhaps it was too much success-too soon, or an editor who rushed this last book to publishing which led to this fiasco. It is disappointing that the writer did not value the many young minds who waited for the conclusion. The rambling shows the control of an alcoholic and the shoddy conclusion reveals a lack of creativity. It is clear that he did not give enough time and thought to develop something with more control and imagination. It is sad that many children will approach other serial writers skeptically after this miserable ending to the miserable series 
 I have this gloss in Carney. While I like the color, the gloss is very gooey and gloppy and it doesn't stay on long at all. I would not buy it again 
 "The End of Democracy" (2003) is the best answer to this theory 
 De Soto's work was viewed by economists, historians, and politicians alike as breakthrough.  He gives us an in-depth look at the Lima's informal sector and postulates, much to the satisfaction of his Washington, D.C.  bankroll, that Peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market  capitalism.  Unfortunately, he has twisted Peru's real scenario to reflect  what Washington wants to hear.  In reality, Lima's informal sector is  merely a way for a depraved population to survive, not a radical shift  toward capitalism.  De Soto's Institue for Liberty and Democracy was funded  almost in full by Washington, and the man himself has spent more time in  the U.S. than in Peru.  This book leans more toward American propaganda  than objective analysis.  An interesting read, but only with abundant  grains of salt 
 I know this film has some historical significance being the first British feature-length animated film and all, but to the modern viewer who has never had the privilege to read Orwell's masterpiece this film is a watered-down injustice due to the added humor in the story (I don't remember anything about a playful baby duck) and the tacked on "happy" ending.  Some other things that I found bothersome were the slow pace and the distracting humming sound.  Read the book instead, it's short and won't take you too long.  MTV will still be there when you get finished. 
 Although this may be a good marketing book for writers, I found the lack of professional typesetting bothersome: using lines of hyphens between entries, instead of subject headers or bullets; using bold AND italics for book titles are just a few problems. But the biggest error is that there is no index in the back of the book. A book such as this begs for a lengthy index of author's names, subject headers, book titles, etc. I found it frustrating trying to navigate through this hodge podge of advice. 
 There are such a plethora of flaws in Al Di Meola's latest (unfortunately titled) album that it would, perhaps, be an appropriate act of charity to mention some of its virtues- namely, the guitarist's reliably beautiful tone (on both electric and acoustic), an immaculate production and colorful looking liner note booklet. However, the fact remains that "Consequence of Chaos" is awful, the worst work in Di Meola's 30 year solo career and an unsightly blemish on an original and talented musician's resume.   There is a confounding lack of creative purpose on display throughout: while fit within the tightly arranged patterns Di Meola favors, the tunes are, on all levels (melodic, harmonic and rhythmic), noticeably devoid of inspiration. Indeed, it is hard to interpret this album as anything other than being aimed at the "smooth jazz" audience- the artist running on autopilot while cranking out a simplified (and simplistic) caricature of himself. Even the tunes featuring (mentor and former employer) Chick Corea have the aire of mediocrity about them. This all the more frustrating considering that Di Meola's previous release ("Flesh on Flesh") was excellent, ranking with his best work: exciting, well-written compositions, with inspired playing by Di Meola and fellow musicians (including Gonzalo Rubalcaba on electric piano).   While "Consequence of Chaos" is certainly a big letdown for those who know and enjoy Al Di Meola's music, newcomers should be especially wary, in that this disastrous release gives such a negative and skewed impression. While Di Meola's recorded legacy is uneven, there are a number of very good albums bearing witness to his true scope as an artist. Irritatingly, many persist to this day in associating the guitarist exclusively with his early solo recordings on Columbia, a series largely comprised of immature, stiff and dated period pieces. Far richer musical rewards can be found through exploring Di Meola's post-Columbia catalogue:   "Al Di Meola Revisited" is an excellent compilation taken from his 3 albums recorded from 1985 through 1987. Beautiful compositions, some featuring Di Meola's acoustic guitar; the lengthy "Cielo e Terra" (from album of same name) is a complex and mysteriously pulsating piece with the great Airto Moreira on percussion. There are also a couple of fiery electric tunes ( "Bejing Demons" & "Song to the Pharoah Kings" ) which successfully combine the tight and aggressive, suite-like arrangements of Di Meola's previous work with light ( Pat Metheny influenced) Brazilian/pop textures and guitar synthesisers.  Two albums DiMeola recorded in the early 1990's ( "World Sinfonia" and "Heart of the Immigrants" ) bear the stamp of Astor Piazzolla's highly original and vibrant "tango nuevo". The late Argentinean genius spurred Di Meola to some of his most sophisticated and impassioned playing, not only in versions of wonderous Piazzolla compositions but in a variety of originals and standards which hold together as well today as they did 15 years ago.   Listening to the aforementioned albums may prove the best remedy for both sustaining faith in a talented musician and banishing the memories of a particularly egregious release.

 Lorraine Heath has lost her talent in drawing a picture and making it come to life.  I agree with another reviewer---go back to Texas--that's where you best work shines 
 I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about.  I forced myself to read this book because all I had ever heard was how it was one of the best and most influential pieces of modern literature, but eight hours a day of manual labor would be a less tiresome task then trudging through this pile of rubbish. In all honesty, the plot is entertaining, if you can find it.  I am sure the Cliffs Notes of the LOTR are interesting and entertaining, but why anyone would want to torture themselves reading this collection is beyond me.   I read one chapter a night until I was done, and that was too grueling a task.  I constantly found my mind wondering and having to reread every page because it could not hold my attention.   You don't have to believe the hype.  This collection of books is really, really terrible and boring, and I wouldn't wish the task of reading in on my worst enemy 
 received above book; correct cover, but inside is another book by name of 'the glass key' by dashiell hammett. tried to contact you by various means, to no avail.original packaging long gone. how do i go about getting the book i ordered?? 
 This is one of the few books where I can honestly say that the movie was better...  much better.  I was not impressed with Koontz's bad guy who was not very well developed at all.  The world is not so black and white, which makes things far more interesting 
 Because we are human!! We have the same greedy and lustful desires as everyone else. Anyone who disagrees and uses some theology on why we don't and how and why everyone can and should resist this is a hypocrite. Evangelicals are the epitomy of hypocrisy. 
 While I disagree with much of the content of this book, that is not why you shouldn't buy this book. The reason not to buy is that this book is greatly out-dated. It was from before 9-11, and the neo-con perspective and focus on the world is now quite different 
 the premise was great, a really nice idea for a book.  there were a few interesting statistics in the book, but overall i found the book pointless and rambling.  i'm still not sure what i was supposed to have taken from it.  was there a point?    i agree wholeheartedly with a previous poster who wondered about eisenberg's definition of "middle class".  despite a couple of charts breaking assets and earnings up by quintile, his anecdotes and stories clearly predominantly focused on the top fifth or top tenth of americans.  
 This brief book spells out some basic concepts involved in drum tuning that might be helpful for those who have little to no experience tuning drums.  However, as an experienced drummer, I found few insights that were helpful.  Most of the tips were common knowledge among the drummers I know, and widely available on internet sites 
 I have to be pretty honest - I was excited to get this kit, but so far I've been disappointed.  Maybe I'm not getting the whole technique down, but I find the diagrams pretty generalized and the powder flakes everywhere it isn't supposed to (like under my eyes, making them look very raccoon-y and tired--and when wearing smoky eyes, I figure you probably want everything else to look pretty bright in comparison to the dramatic eye effect).  Maybe I can't pull of the look or maybe I'm not applying it correctly, but either way, it always ends up looking like a big, dark, glittery mess...I'm a big Bare Escentuals lover, but I was disappointed with this product.  
 This book's explanations vary from poor to excellent. The derivations, while they are given, are not well done. They often skip steps that leaving the reader wondering just how they got from point A to point B. The answers in the back of the book and in the instructor's solutions manual are also often incorrect. The publisher of this book also elected to put large sections of this book online instead of in the book. An entire chapter, the astrophysics section, is online, which is absolutely ludicrous for such an expensive book. Overall, this book just doesn't cut it 
 I was very disappointed in this translation. Bringing the language into  modern form distorted the meanings and lost the beauty and simplicity of  the original. I recommend Gitanjali if you want to experience real Tagore 
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
 I heard this author on BobBrinker.  While I think its great that student debt hurts the graduate, the author deceptively eludes to increased taxation as a way to solve this problem.  There's no question that the cost of education has gone up along with housing costs and medical care.  The answer is not to poor more resources into it but students must find a away to overcome.  There are 3 criticisms to her argument:  1.  making education more affordable thru taxation when allow universities to raise their tuition.  2.  IRA's moneys are taxed when they are distributed.  3.  Making it easier to go to college discourage people from saving money over their childhood and working before school.    This is a political issue and while it may seem compassionate, its just another argument for socialism which never worked anyway.  Just look at Europe.  
 There's one major flaw with Bostonian square toes - I have three pair so trust me when I say this: you can't find inserts/insoles for them. The shoot fits snuggly and comfortably, the backs don't wear out and cause pain to your heels, but the insole goes flat in less than a year and you'll be donating the shoes as there's no way to find square-toe inserts; Bostonian says they neither make nor can suggest where to find square toe inserts. 
 Decent good guys but what drunk wrote the story.  How did the Zhentarim get dragged into a story that some many holes in it.   The book should be called the Realm book that no story written just for the money potential.   Realms fans are sadly ripped off by this Harpers series wannabee 
   I bought this book based on the reviews. I found the prologue fascinating and began reading the story eagerly, but I immediately had a sense that the rest of the book had been written by someone else. The best way I can describe it is that it felt like I was reading fiction written either by or for high school students. I tried skipping ahead a bit but found the same problem throughout. Very disappointed 
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 One of the blurbs I read on the book jacket compared this book to Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm. No way!. Those two books were edge-of-your-seat reading experiences. This account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring. The action doesn't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then, the cliched writing and deification of Balf's subjects make this book very hard to get through. Unless you are a serious kayaking fan, I would not recommend this book 
 This man obviously knows nothing about human behavior. Most people know that just because someone can't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest. In more cases than not, they simply have low self-esteem are very self-conscious, and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or I might do when asked to do improv. This man himself is a manipulator, and a liar. He's manipulating you to get this book,  taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience. Lying and "hypnotizing" people in order to get the truth out of them, is far less effective than being honest yourself. If you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars. You will start to have an understanding of people's energies if you just pay attention 
 John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. I love Of Mice And Men, East of Eden, and The Grapes Of Wrath. But this 4-part story of a a boy and a horse (which isn't even about the horse that much) is pointless drivel. I'll admit, I liked the first part of it, which is great and good enough to warrant two stars. The rest of it feels disjointed. I couldn't wait to get done with it.  It isn't a terrible book, but it isn't good at all. It's below average, and below average is not what I expect from the writer of Of Mice And Men 
  I am chubby's great grand son on the so called dumb farmgirls side. I find it very disrespectful to write a book about a man's history without interviewing or elaborating on the one person who was there. My grandmother could shed more light on the Orange Blossom conspiracy than any one alive. she has shared very vivid and detailed stories about the man and the song. And believe me, she is no dumb farmgirl. She is brilliant and deserves some respect for keeping an entire family together while he turned his back on them 
 I'd say it was an ok movie, nothing to rave about. Monica Bellucci was a miss-fit, I didnt think she fit in at all as an American doctor helping poor Africans. Bruce Willis is always good. The action scene in the village was probably the best part. The last scene were not all that great at all, very ameaturish in my opinion. I found it really funny, that none of the Nigerian soldiers could shoot straight. Its ironic that all the people trying to do something good for the Africans were either Americans or Europeans, considering the fact that much of Africa's problems today could be attributed to European Colonization, or how everyone turned a blind-eye to what happened in Rwanda. If you want to watch a really good movie on this subject, then watch HOTEL RWANDA 
 All throughtout this book Alex Delaware and his police friend Milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover.  They have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture.  The reader longs for the pair to actually do something.  In the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings.  That is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking.  I read and enjoyed several of the early Alex Delaware books and then quit looking for new ones, now I know why 
 This so-called Guide To Charm is not guiding at all. I personally do not feel more charming after reading it, and have furthermore...no clue as to how I can improve my charming skills and yet...I thought that was what the book was about. Believe me, you do not need this book. The authors keep saying they would give you advice on such and such and then apologize and mention it's really not the point of such a small book. In one word: unuseful. There is no hint, no advice, not a thing I did not know by common-sense. Don't Waste your money on this book. There are such good ones on this matter but this very one 
 Consider yourself warned: DO NOT buy this set from Amazon!  I ordered it on 5-28-2006 and Amazon has since then emailed me EVERY 10-20 days to inform me that there has been a delay in the product's arrival.  In order to keep the order active, you have to go to the Amazon site and approve the delay.  This is what I've been doing for 5 months now!  I've emailed Amazon twice about it, and they credited me $5 and STILL DON'T HAVE the product in stock that they are supposedly selling to people.  Save yourself the headache; Amazon doesn't actually have this product.  Buy elsewhere.  (Submitted 10-25-2006 
 When I first read this book 13 years ago, I thought it was great. Re-reading it with a more mature and educated mind, I found it insulting.  First, the eternal burning love between Deborah and Tim has almost no basis for the power it has over them. A few late-night conversations and their love spans time and distance? Give me a break.  Then, there's the Catholicism. I can't speak to the authenticity of the Judaism in the book, but as a Catholic journalist, I can speak with some authority on that.  The idea that a man can go from priest to monsignor to ARCHBISHOP in 15 years, and before age 40 is insulting. Currently, the youngest U.S. bishop was ordained at age 47. Pope John II was ordained a bishop at age 38.   Far-fetched ideas aside, Segal's writing is definitely easy to read, until he tries to show us how well he researched this book, with his overly frequent italicized used of Yiddish, Hebrew and Latin.   Looking for an intelligent, realistic love story? Stay away from Segal's novels and check out Audrey Niffeneger's "The Time-Traveler's Wife"; Sue Monk Kidd's "The Secret Life of Bees"; or Anita Shreve's "All He Ever Wanted." 
 This book is pretty much like all the other diet books around. 
 This was a very thin book for the price. I didn't get a lot out of it. I love spiritual books but this one was not very informative and each page there was just a lot of repition. I got bored with it 
 The world does not need another trivia game, where a well-timed "guess" can win over legitimate knowledge of a subject.  That, in a nutshell, is about all you need to know about Fact or Crap.    What's worse is: some of the questions are poorly worded, and will no doubt result in an argument that will only be solved by (in the best case) somebody whipping out their web-enabled cell phone and Googling the subject or (in the worst case) somebody leaving the game upset.    Case in point: A question said (paraphrased) "Nails grow throught one's life", and the answer was "crap", with no explanation given.  This resulted in a bit of an argument, and we still don't know what the truth is.  The card wound up being removed from the game.    Every time you play this game, you will have one of these questions.  This game is tedious, and cheaply made to boot.  The "tokens" are simply cardboard punchouts.  The cards are not quality laminated cardstock like you'd get in a game like Trivial Pursuit.  There are plenty of better trivia games, sold at a lower price, with better construction.  On the plus side: it is easy to find a used copy.. 
 In my opinion the author is completely off base with his theories.  I don't see how this book can help anyone of any age.  I'm glad this was a borrowed book.  My time could have been better spent on a cheap romance novel 
 This book is like some kind of Bible to hard-core Lefties, but I think they must never have actually opened it and read what was inside.  Freire wrotes admiringly of Mao's Cultural Revolution and Castro's Cuba, and quotes Lenin as a brother-in-arms.  His bottom line seems to be that a pseudo-intellectual "revolutionary leader" like himself is the only sort of person who truly "understands" the "peasants" and can guide them to higher consciousness.  The book is almost laughably poorly written, and incredibly pretentious and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it reads like a tract by some self-adoring Latin American left-wing dictator (like Castro) justifying his own grasp on power.  A dangerous book, if only because it flaunts its own deep ignorance and if it did fall into the hands of people who didn't know any better they might actually believe some of this garbage 
  M. Gary Neuman puts fear in the hearts of my married people. His notion that emotional infidelity is more dangerous than a sexual affair because everyone wants emotional attachments, is more a scare tactic rather than good advice.   If you look at his rules, then anyone who has an emotional attachment outside of marriage is guilty of infidelity. Best-friends, close siblings, parents, children from a previous marriage, could all fall into these rules. You could have an emotional affair with your mother or your best friend.   Instead of focusing on real issues that cause "jealousy" Neuman blatantly says that we should avoid and be on guard for those people who might even want a friendship.   This whole concept is wrong.   There are better books and better sources to read 
 I did like the Three Cheers album, in fact I liked every single song on the cd.  The Black Parade is basically the same thing.  In every song I find myself being reminded of a song on the previous cd.  This cd is extremely similar but has less diversity.  If you already own Three Cheers, I wouldn't waste the money on Black Parade 
 Like many people, I was drawn to Light in the Piazza by its amazing reviews.  It was only after I had purchased tickets that I saw the performance on the Tonys.  It didn't bode well.  As a whole the c.d, much like the production, is over-dramatic, overly sensational.  The music has been called "lush," however I think it leans more to "trying too hard."  It is all far too overdone.  The music also lacks any sort of conflict or passion.  All in all, a great disappointment 
 I hadn't heard of the book or the author before I picked it.   I read its first few pages and  Was hooked.  The main character, Cacciato [how do you pronounce this name?], decides to walk away from the Vietnam war and hike overland to Paris. His platoon follows him. The book describes their adventures.   The first quarter of the book contains some of the best combat narrative I have read, it describes the trauma, the randomness, the banality, the irritation of involuntarily living cheek-by-jowl with others.  This part for me flowed along. I was able to suspend disbelief about the fact that they were on a mission to track down one of their comrades who was walking into enemy territory.  Without giving the story away, there was a point where they came into contact with the Vietnamese enemy, where I gave up entirely.  The fiction had become magic realism, there was no going back to credibility and I'm afraid I lost the plot.   I did however persevere and finish, but I cannot recommend it based on my initial impressions.  The writing overall is excellent, the characters well-documented, but  I cannot follow when the plot doesn't have the pretence of credibility.   I would have liked to have liked this book more. 
 This book really only covers a general concept of the computer animation field. For people wanting to just unearth the mere basics and lingo, the glossary at the end of each chapter might be useful. Besides that, the book lacks any real depth to the topics discussed, and is rather disappointing when these terms are freely available online. The "Getting Ready" tips for each section was laughable, written with the assumption that readers lack common sense. Furthermore, the unorganized structure of the book meant the referenced picture in the text is in MOST cases a few pages away. My 1 star goes to the coloured pictures and the glossary 
 Mr Yoo moves on from his earlier arguments that torture falls at a point slightly short of physical death, organ failure or loss of limb. Mr Yoo makes some interesting if devastating points with his new theories. The President's war powers, he argues, allow him to do, basically, whatever he wants. The President may, if he chooses, crush the genitals of children, maim, torture or kill civilians. In this respect one might remember that Bush ordered an air strike on the house occupied by the infant grandchildren of Saddam Hussein AFTER the end of the Iraq war and even though the house was surrounded by US troops. The President is limited, according to Mr Yoo, only by how he CHOOSES to interpret International Treaties and as he has the power to repudiate such treaties or ignore them entirely (as in the International Human Rights for the Child Treaty, the Geneva Convention or the Treaty of Vienna,) then, this means that presidential power is absolute EVEN if despotic criminal or tyrannical. Mr Yoo appears now to say that the President and his henchmen, cronies and agencies MAY indeed use indiscriminant torture. Mr Yoo however does not adequately explain how the President can thus overturn congressional treaty ratification. As what constitutes a 'time of war' is also up to the President and does not rely on any 'legal' declaration of war (which is a matter of international law to which the US is thus not subject,) then the US may have, effectively, a Despot Emperor for President. Does the 'War on Drugs' thus give the President the same wartime powers as he asserts for his 'War on Terror' - an undeclared war on no particular nation state? Is the US thus always in a state of war? This is interesting, not just semantically, as the District and Supreme Courts appear to agree with Mr Yoo's interpretation, blocking cases connected with this on grounds of national security whilst Congress does not appear to care. Perhaps Clinton should have used Mr Yoo's arguments in the Monical Lewinsky scandal and impeachment hearings. War powers might have thus allowed him to do whatever he wanted with his cigar and to lie about it in the national interest. The problem with Mr Yoo's argument is that Checks and Balances thus no longer appear to exist. Interestingly if one applies Mr Yoo's arguments to their logical end he becomes an eloquent advocate for terrorism or for the Holocaust where the ends justify the use of any means, however horrible. Of course, either this is pretty much nonsense and makes toilet paper of the Declaration of Independence, Magna Carta, democracy and human rights OR the truth is more terrifying and the US is now a Stalinist or Nazi state. I suspect Mr Yoo could be subject to arrest as a war criminal should he ever leave the United States and visit a civilised country?? 
 Bad reviews typically receive bad reviews. So be it. After several chapters of trying to decide whether the problem was me or the author, I simply gave up. This is no easy read. I don't think we gain much from an endless list of data. 
 I'm deep in the midst of planning a wedding. Early on, I checked out this book and two others (The Complete Guide to Gay and Lesbian Weddings and the Essential Guide to Lesbian and Gay Weddings) from the library to see which ones I might want to buy. I expected this book to be my favorite, but found it next to useless.   This book was cute and sometimes funny but lacked substance. All of the advice was based on a very traditional wedding and assumed a level of parental involvement (and their $$) I found pretty unlikely for many couples. My main concerns: chapters full of fluffy fillers, inaccurate information and missing key pieces.   First, there was no information about finding a reception or ceremony site, other than a cute but silly "find you style" quiz. I was hoping for concrete information on choosing a gay-friendly site, working with vendors, signing a contract and ways to hold a wedding at your home. nada.   Instead, there's a whole chapter devoted to quizzes on sex after marriage (funny but unhelpful) and another of legal issues (adoption, domestic partnerships etc). The legal chapter is already out of date and inaccurate. Please please do not rely on it. Check out Nolo's A Legal Guide for Lesbian and Gay Couples and the HRC website instead.   Also, the alternative wedding section was only a few pages long. They only included a paragraph each on destination weddings or "ethnic" weddings. I would have been happy to cut out the section on attendents and the presents you should give them in favor of more alternative wedding ideas, creative invitations or ideas on dealing with wedding stress.   I did really like the wedding stories that preceeded each chapter. Definitely the best thing about the book.  But I would still recommend either of the other two books I mentioned instead. The Essential Guide is dated, but still the best of the bunch in my opinion.  The Complete Guide came out in 2004 and has a very reassuring tone.  
 As the previous reviewer pointed out, this is NOT the KLIC-5001 1700 mAh battery as described in the Product Details, it is the lower capacity (1050 mAh) KLIC-5000.   At least it is the Kodak battery, if that matters to you. (I have a new Kodak camera and want to protect the warranty.)  If not, plenty of places sell the generic KLIC-5001 for less than Amazon sells the Kodak KLIC-5000 
 I purchase quite a bit of equipment for my company and I have to say this was one of the more disappointing ones. The deficiencies in this printer are only exaggerated by Epson's non English speaking technical people. And on top of that, Epson agrees there are issues that reduce the unit's capabilities. Wait until you have to replace all 8 cartriges when all you need is black. The drivers don't let you specify. There is an after market driver available, but get ready to put out $600. Then you have to usually special order those 8 cartriges. I could go on and on, but it would just take less time to buy a different printer 
 Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.  I believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality 
 I was very hopeful that this printer would meet my needs.  The printer worked fine with my 1GB SD card, and also when I connected my PictBridge-compatible camera.  (I should mention that the dark tones in the printer appeared very dark.)  However I also just bought a couple of 2GB SanDisk Ultra II cards.  The printer doesn't recognize these cards when inserted into the appropriate slot - it gives an error message that the card could not be recognized.  I contacted HP support and they verified indeed that the printer does not support SD cards larger than 1 GB.  I'm sorry that I'll have to return the printer 
 Needless to say, it wasn't. While Irving's literary style always has merit, he does a poor job at characterization- which is especially disappointing, considering the title of the book is "The World According To Garp." With a name like that, you'd expect the title character to be perceiving and insightful, but instead Garp is boring and egocentric, thinking of little but his own cheap desires. If that was the point, then I feel duped.  And while his mother is certainly more interesting- she's even more self-absorbed, and so it hardly makes up for anything. There's an almost sociopathic quality to his main characters, and while Irving probably didn't intend to portray them that way- it's still an enormous flaw I was unable to overlook 
 I couldn't get past all of her horrible contractions.  If these are blue-blood Englishmen, then their vocabulary is horrible!  The story line was confusing because she felt it necessary to bring in every character she ever wrote about.  A horrible attempt to garner money for the holiday season 
 This cd is, without a doubt amazing.  Stars are lost because prior to recording, you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn NOISE GATE for his guitar rig.  His tone is crushing & sounds perfect, but the second he stops playing, every time SSSSQQQQQQUUUUEEEAAAALLLLL.  It's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once, because it is a chronic problem in every song. 
 This disk has tiny, tiny little brushes on it.  It didn't seem to do anything for my DVD player 
 I have been a fan of Mr. Bachs for over 25 years.  I gave his books as gifts to every one I knew, but this book "Out of My Mind" was such a disappointment.  I finished the book in about an hour and wondered where is the rest of the book?  I immediatly noticed the absence of Leslie and the build up to the new women in his life and put it together that he had found a new muse. It was not the divorce that floored me, but the complete absence of a a story!!!  I thought this was just a primer for the real book, so I went to his web page to get info and found that he was selling photos of a pasture and raggedy scarves that had previously flown on his plane for an exorbitant amount of money.  It was then I relized that Leslie must have gotten a tidy settlement and Mr. Bach was perhaps in great need of funds.  I wish him well and thank him for the memories, but will wait for the reviews for his next book.  The title sayed it all "Out of His Mind" 
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash. 
 take 2 ugly men and toss in an overhyped horrible singer/actress and youve got another razzie.minus j-lo and this might have been a 2 star movie 
 My wife and I just returned from Kyoto, and unfortunately we were relying on this book as our guide. The information was, for the most part, up-to-date.. but the maps were *horrible*. I dunno if they just used maps from the 1930s, or hand drew them from memory, or what.. but you are going to get seriously lost if you rely on these things. There are almost no street names included and the walking tours often rely solely on hard-to-find landmarks.   They also missed some major sights.. for example, Gion; I dunno about you, but I'm interested in seeing some of the tea houses where Geisha actually work. The guide talks about these and gives you one place to look for them. However, it totally skips one of the most beautiful tea house districts located in Maruyama Park! We stumbled on this place by complete accident, and found it to be the best place for Geisha-watching.  It also appears to be an exclusive area where the really well-off clients go, and so perhaps it wasn't covered to keep down the crowds.. but that's the kind of information I *want* in a guidebook.   In short we were extremely dissapointed in this guide. I don't know what would be a good substitute, but I can tell you to avoid this one 
 I hate to be the fly in the ointment of the other reviews.  But as someone who is more concerned with protecting his networks than trying to figure out the math behind the security, I found this book's title and description on the back cover as well as in the preface to be *highly* misleading.  By reading the preface and the back of the book, you gain absolutely no indication that this book is mired in mathematical theory with very little practical application to the everyday, IT environment. The only possible audience for this book comprises computer science students and software engineers who are into encryption, cipher algorithms, and related theories.  There is absolutely no indication of that until you actually start getting into the chapters.  That is not to belittle Mr. Bishop, what he knows, or what he does. I have no doubt that as a professor at the University of California at Davis he is well respected and very knowledgeable of his field. I'm equally sure that in a scientific, trivia challenge, his knowledge and experience would beat me into the ground until I was just a thin, red film. I'm only saying that this book is not one that I can recommend to anyone who is looking for practical, security solutions, contrary to what the title might infer. It is far too mathematical in nature and creates complexities to the theories of computer security that frankly do not apply to the day-to-day systems and network administrator.  In the real world practical, IT solutions include identifying how potential intruders might gain entry to the network. Practical solutions also include how to identify weaknesses in the existing network infrastructure as well as weaknesses in the existing authentication mechanism, among others. Once these weaknesses are identified, IT people need practical solutions to eliminate those weaknesses. Even if the potential solutions are not practical at the current time, identifying what can happen until such time must happen for in order to plan the next stage of securing the environment.  These matters are certainly discussed but not in ways that most IT professional would consider to be valuable. Discussions on the Chinese Wall Model, lattices, and the Extended Euclidean algorithm are not going to be of any practical use whatsoever when you are looking to select and implement an authentication mechanism for a heterogeneous enterprise, nor are they going to be of value when you're looking a Sarbanes-Oxley auditor in the eye and he asks "So, please explain your network security implementations and how you plan on securing your login procedures."  Unfortunately, even those topics that have no direct relation to mathematics, such as availability and the implementation of an auditing system, are described through mathematical formulae. To most IT personnel, auditing involves intruder detection, log scanning, network monitoring, SNMP traps, and of course reporting tools to determine when there is suspicious activity. If I went to my manager and said that we have to anticipate pending connections based on the formula a + b is greater than cb, he'd tell me to contact the confidential, Employee Help line. I can only imagine what he'd tell me if I said that we have to tune our incoming-packet, time-out value in the Solaris kernel to be based on the Linux implementation of the Berstein and Shenk formula of h(s1,sa,sp,da,dp,s1) + n + ((2^24)*t) + [h(s2, sa,sp,da,dp,s2) mod 2^24].  Now, in fairness my review might be rather harsh, but I think it's more the frustration that this book's description is not accurate to its contents and expectations that it puts on the potential reader. Perhaps it is accurate when it comes to the actual content as suggested by the other glowing reviews, but it most certainly is not when it comes to the expected audience or what their expectation might be. In this case I'm sure that this is the right book, but the way that the preface and and back cover are written clearly are not indicative of the intended audience.  Metaphorically speaking, I was expecting to find directions so that I could drive to the nearest grocery store. Instead, I ended up reading about the physics of depressing the accelerator pedal with just the right amount of pressure in combination with the thermodynamics of the detonation of a combustible, fuel substance with a mixture of oxygen and the appropriate temperature and aperture of the ignition mechanism to create the most efficient energy source within a controlled environment. Additionally, I received information about the methodologies of harnessing that thermodynamic energy and converting it through the appropriate gear and torque mechanisms to a forward thrust thus making it possible to move the vehicle in the direction intended while simultaneously balancing out the appropriate fluid injection and combustion level. Also taken into consideration was the manipulation of the speed impedance lever so as to reduce or cease in its entirety the inertial momentum, regardless of direction, of the vehicle when necessary. Let us not forget the guidance controlling mechanism thus altering the directional inertia of the vehicle so as to project it to the destination position to which I expect the vehicle to travel.  Even with all of that, I still don't know where the nearest grocery store is 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I think this book is of, literally, only academic interest.  The author's premise:  capitalism will only be "safe" when protected by (Ta Da!!) -- more government regulation!  Only an academic (or a socialist) could come to this conclusion!  The fundamental premise of this book is that the danger to Capitalism is exclusively from "crony" Capitalists.  This is surely tantamount to blaming the victim for the crime.  The authors take tremendous pains to footnote a variety of statements, and then make a totally unsubstantiated claim of price-fixing against modern business by dredging up an ancient Adam Smith quote!  They point to the correlation between market regulations and higher stock valuations, mistaking it for causation.  Not one single time do they even mention the danger posed to capitalism by the MSM, socialist NGO's, lawyers, or the tangle of local, state, and federal regulations.  Only twice do they mention, in passing, the arguments of libertarians.  We are not a politically powerful party, but our opinions on capitalism surely must deserve, at the least, a vigorous rebuttal.  And finally, the recommendations are ad-hoc -- there is no flow of evidence or argument to support them.  Indeed, the conclusions are, in typical academic fashion, sadly naive.  An example is their belief that property taxes are somehow less onerous than income taxes.  This is a position in opposition to the authors' defense of property rights.  Indeed, Texas just passed a law to begin taxing business income because the previous system, based solely on business property, imposed no tax burden on doctors, lawyers, accountants, actors, authors, college professors engaged in sideline businesses, etc.  Little wonder that "old line" businesses were moving overseas or dying out -- they were supporting the parasites, doubly.  The reader is engaged only on the occasions (and by accident?) when the authors reveal insights derived from their experiences with other cultures, or when they review certain lesser-known historical facts.  In conclusion, I was disappointed in this "apology" for capitalism.  To give the authors credit, I would say that it must be very difficult to write a book espousing capitalism and still expect to get or keep tenure at a private, U. S. university, even one with Hayek and Friedman in the pedigree. 
 I had a difficult time with this book. Having ready "Flags of Our Fathers", I had hopes this would be as well written and informitive. However, from early on this book came across as just another piece of "pagan liberal propoganda". The ethnic cleansing of American Indians by the United States was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there. The pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the United States does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions. This book is another pagan apologetic for what's wrong with the US and right with all nations who wish us ill. 
 I bought this book because my name happens to be the exact same as the author's. I thought it would be novel to show to my friends and family, especially my father, whose name is also the same as the author's. Little did I know that the author was devoid of any original thought. As I perused the book, it became evident that the author had amassed a bunch of well-written poems and slapped his name on it. I thought my review quite harsh until my father said the same thing. The author is a disgrace to Daniel Aldersons everywhere. 
 all right... so this movie isn't bad. but it isn't that good either.  the good things are that prescott is actually, well, good in some parts of the movie. also, they didn't call the kid another name like in home alone 3.  the bad things are that lots of the actors didn't do very well in this film and the writing is terrible. The booby traps lasted for only 10 minutes!  so either you don't watch this movie, rent it, or borrow it. don't spend your money on buying it 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 Many years ago I read "The Things They Carried" by this author which was based on his experiences as an American soldier in Vietnam. That was an award winning book.  Unfortunately, "July, July", which is about a 30-year class reunion in the year 2000 of a group of people who came of age during that period of time, falls flat on its face.   This is an interrelated story of what happened to this these people.  In the book, they are all now in their early fifties, and not one of them has really grown up.  It's a fast read, only 306 small pages, and there are some flashbacks to 1969.  But everyone seems to be have made poor choices and are unhappy with how their lives turned out.  There's a lot of whining as they all come together again.   All of their angst has to do with their romances gone sour.  There's not a word about their philosophy or the economy or technology or any of the vast changes that have occurred during the past 30 years.  And, even in that "lost romance" department, I found myself laughing out loud in places which were supposed to be serious.  I believe that anyone who has lived a full life probably has had some romantic disappointment in his or her background.  However, the people I know don't spend a lifetime wallowing in despair about them and letting such memories ruin the rest of their lives.  That's why this book just didn't ring true for me.   Forget about this book.  The story is weak, there's not a single likable character in the whole bunch, and the narrative is generally annoying.  Good thing it was a fast read and that it held my interest.  Otherwise I wouldn't have read past the first chapter.   
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 What a disappointment! Poorly written, bitter, jealous and small minded. Less said the better 
 I've gone thru half the book, and I'm very disapointed to say the least. I've done some html and css for abaout a year now, and I have'nt had any problems following a book in those subjects until now. The images that you need isnt there and when they are there the exercices doesnt work as you expect, inspite that I doublecheck 5 times so that I don't forget something in the code.. so boring. I'm convinced that most of the "5-star" reviews are sent in by the authors themselves. I dont recomend this book 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 "The Passing of The Great Race" was one of the racialist books written between 1855 and 1920 that would strongly influence the the National Socialist Party. The first was Gobineau's "The Inequality of The Human Races", the second was Houston Stewart Chamberlain's "The Foundations of The Nineteenth Century", the third was this one, and the fourth was Lothrop Stoddard's "The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy". Grant was a lawyer and conservationist who was a firm beleiver in the Old Order, free of Bolshevism and Socialism and centered around an Anglo-Saxon culture. Grant always tried to portray himself as more scientific than romantic racial theorists such as Chamberlain, but his theories actually have little scientific basis. For example, his division of Whites into Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean Races is anchored only on the basis of Nordic Scnadinavians having blonde hair, Alpine Slavs having brown hair, and Mediterranean Italians having black hair. Even worse is Grant's lack of historical basis. He considers the French, Southern Germans, and Poles to be a mix of Teutonic or Celtic Nordic peoples and dark-haired Alpine peoples who invaded Europe from Asia, but there was never any record of Asiatic peoples reaching France or Germany, at least not after the Celtic period. His classifications of Alpine are also very flimsy. He considers Southern Germans to be of Alpine stock, completely ignoring the fact that Southern Germans speak a Teutonic language and often have Teutonic features such as blonde hair and blue eyes. He also considers the Walloons of Belgium to be Alpine, ignoring the fact that they are descendants of the Celtic Belgae, who the Romans clearly described as being tall with blonde and red hair {sounds Nordic to me}. He also claims that the Irish and Welsh have substantial amounts of Mediterranean blood, ignoring the fact that both those peoples are Celtic and often have blonde or red hair. The most puzziling part of this whole thing is how this book became so popular when practicaly everyone is labled as inferior. Grant considers the only pure Nordics to be people with blonde hair and blue eyes, so why did people like Teddy Roosevelt {brunett} endorse it? Grant's book just lacks any spirit. I've read Chamberlain's "Foundations of The Nineteenth Century", and anyone who is of Celtic, Teutonic, or Slavic stock and is anti-Semitic will be riled up with the romaticism of the "Germanic" race being in constant battle with the Jews for survival. Anyone who has Celtic, Scandinavian, German, Anglo-Saxon, Polish, or Baltic ancestry is included in this Germanic race, while Grant tends to alienate anyone who isn't a blonde, blue-eyed Anglo-Saxon or Swede, even putting the Germans down as inferior. This book should also be compared to Stoddard's "The Rising Tide of Color", which was written four years later. Stoddard also went by the Nordic-Alpine-Mediterranean model, but focused less on this than on the White Race as a whole. Stoddard was a visionary, looking to White issue in the future. While Grant clamored about keeping non-Nordic Russians and Italians out of the country, Stoddard warned that the real dangers are non-White Asians and Negroes. Grant's book has little relevance to today's issues, as practically every White American is a German-Irish-Polish-Italian mix. Stoddard, however, saw that all Whites had to band together against the "rising tide of color".                      
 I'm a sicko of a Yes fan. I own all their albums on vinyl, bought them again on cassette in the 80s, and bought them again on CD in the 90s. But I've got to draw the line somewhere.  How many freakin times can a band re-release the same "greatest hits" with a different cover? When I was notified by Amazon of a new Yes album, I jumped all over it thinking, "the boys are back for the first time in 7 years!" But no, it's more like "the boys have released their 7th greatest hits CD in 7 years."  PLEASE DON'T ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR! Don't buy this album or it'll just make them do it again, and again, and again. If we all boycott future Yes greatest hits albums, then maybe they'll be forced to actually WORK for their money. I think we'd all enjoy that for a change. WHO'S WITH ME? 
 Everyone, avoid buying this book.  There are many other books out there.  As you can see on this page, one of the authors of this book tried to justify having made errors by saying other books have errors too.  He also openly admitted having made contextual errors (which is extremely embarrassing) after being pointed out by one of his customers, but the author blasted him away and made no apology about selling incorrect data due to his ignorance and stupidity.  
 How disappointed I was by this book. It contains absolutely no news. The tattoo masters in this book do not meet in any way the high standard of irezumi that I am used to. For all you buyers who really want to learn about Japanese tattoos, read the book by Richie and Buruma, very informative. For photo's who are less blurry than in this book, just check the net or invest many dollars more for a proper book. ... . This book is a nice introduction for some common knowledge about Japanese tattoo art, but does not provide any new insights or ideas 
 How would you feel if you invested in Google and they decided to dedicate 1% of their resources(employees, capital, assets, and time) to the community?  You'd be pissed.  Their stock price would probably drop at least 1% every year due to wasting resources on activities that are outside their core competencies.  This is why the government pays 100.00 for a hammer - they don't know how to make them themselves.  Imagine 4,989 google employees spending 3 days (1% of their yearly effort at work) driving corn oil fueled buses to New Orleans to pull people out of dwellings that been flooded with toxic waste.  Even better lets send them to Irag to count votes.  Maybe a few will get decapitated for their kindness.  In either case their healthcare costs would rise sending the stock price down a little more.  By the way which community should we help first?  Do we take a poll?  Is it based on demographics, need, or should we pick a community out of a hat.  And what about the employees?  Maybe they don't want to help anybody?  Is this in their job description?  Adam Smith and Alexander Hamilton would have to have a duel just to figure out who gets to kick the authors ass first.  
 This book may seem like a great intro book to those well-versed in Telecommunications. However, the book does a terrible job of explaining terms and jargon. A word, for example, will be used for several pages before being defined. There are very few practical examples and metaphors to illustrate concepts and add interest to the book. There are no photographs here either, only basic illustrations which do not clarify concepts, but instead require explaination.  All of my classmates are disgusted that we are required to use this text. Plans are being set for a post-semester Essential-Guide-to-Telecommunications bonfire 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 I picked this book up because of the charming John Currin painting on the cover, but was very disappointed. Ms. Sohn is a sex columnist for the New York Press and New York Magazine, and I guess that makes her feel that she is the 2000's version of Erica Jong. "My Old Man" is supposed to be a picaresque, sexy romp but it comes across as cheap and the sex is both graphic and unerotic at the same time.  Main character Rachel Block is unconvincing depicted as a drop-out rabbinical student, whose lack of compassion has actually caused dying man to keel over dead (because she has failed to console him in anything approaching an appropriate manner). Unsure of what to do at this point in her career, she turns to bartending in the Brooklyn neighborhood she grew up in. Having a chance to meet the famous indie filmmaker, Hank Powell, she throws herself at him and they begin a coarse, entirely sexual affair devoid of any tenderness or romance.  Ms. Sohn name drops so much throughout the book (famous filmmakers, painters, actors), that I am certain Power is supposed to be a particular individual (or composite) but I couldn't tell who. His background of indie films sounds very like Woody Allen's, but the character is much younger. Unfortunately, Ms. Sohn chooses to write his dialogue IN DIALECT, which is one of the most irritating things in the entire book -- why Powell and not the other New Yawkers? -- but I guess it's to underscore his crudeness. If so, it works but only on that level -- Powell is so repugnant (ugly, fat, bald, rude, abusive) that no normal woman would ever be remotely attracted to him.  The character of Rachel is so poorly drawn that we have no idea at all why she ever wanted to be a rabbi, nor does she tell us about her feelings about giving up a career in the clergy -- she doesn't even seem to feel particularly bad about the patient she practically "depressed to death". In fact, she has no spiritual leaning at all, which seems odd in someone who went to all the time and expense to attend rabbinical school. This feels like a detail added to the story just to raise the titillation level -- she's not just a typical Brooklyn Jewess but a FORMER RABBINICAL STUDENT, so her descent into meaningless sex will seem all that more "shocking".  Well...it's not. The sex feels really gratuitous and designed to shock or gross out. I can tell the general theme of the book is to be breezy and funny, but it the desperation in it makes it depressing. None of the characters undergo any self knowledge or transformation...it's just crudely linked chapters that veer from one sexual encounter to another.  I don't think that erotic novels need to cover all the basics of safe sex, but I can honestly state I have never read a book, in this age of AIDS and STDs, that apparently comes out in favor of the "withdrawal method" (coitus interruptus) and non-use of condoms! This seems unbelievably irresponsible -- it's one thing if characters are depicted doing something self-destructive, but the author herself seems to be blandly endorsing this. [...]  I could say more, but am demurring due to space considerations. This was one of the more depressing and discouraging books I have read recently -- the kind that makes you want to take a bath afterwards and wash your hands with santizer. And never have sex again 
 I was expecting a lot more from these two CD's. It teaches you a few items of food, basic words like "Hello", Please" and "airplane" and even teaches you to ask "Where are the suitcases"... but then that is about it. I was really hoping for more... much more 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 Right from the start, when Fleming hopelessly muddles the beginning of the war to put Germany in the best light ("The French, allied with Russia, attacked from the west," he says (p. 43). In fact, it was Germany that unleashed the Schlieffen Plan on France) it is clear this work is a dedicated piece of revisionism. While Fleming spills much ink on his theme the Germans were the victims of shadowy forces conspiring against them, and not primarily responsible for turning a diplomatic stand-off over an act of pre-emptive regicide into a world war, it is clear the true villain of the book is Woodrow Wilson.   If anything goes wrong, Wilson is to blame - not just the failure of the League of Nations, but everything from Bolshevism ("Without U.S. support, the bankrupt British and French could do little but fritter around the edges of the Russian upheaval," p. 342 - gee, I thought the problem with Wilson was he was too eager to intervene in other people`s wars), to prohibition: "If Wilson had been on the job as president instead of playing world savior he might have fought the passage of this bad legislation and immediately started rallying enough congressional votes to sustain a veto. He did neither. It was one more piece of evidence that the president had lost sight of his responsibility as leader of the American people." (p. 414-415).  In exonerating Germany Fleming seems to take positive glee at the fate of "poor little Belgium." "To an objective observer, Northcliffe and his allies in Wellington House would seem to have had a problem arousing pity for Belgium." He describes the appalling personal rule of King Leopold as "a holocaust that exceeds anything in previous, or subsequent, recorded history," and calls Belgium "about as neutral as Scotland" and "about as democratic as Germany." (p. 49-50). Setting aside for a moment Germany's unmentioned but less than stellar record of barbarity in its own Africa dominions (just ask the Herero people), and the book's pooh-poohing of German atrocities during their debauch through Belgium, the principle of state sovereignty itself cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the triumphant march of Fleming's revisionism. Everything the noble Teutons do (or don't do) is ascribed to the noblest of causes - even the failure of German propaganda is ascribed to "Naïve Germanic self-righteousness." (p. 61).  Ironically, it is clear Anglophobic Fleming draws heavily on arch imperialist Niall Ferguson (see footnote 17, p. 494) for his themes (as does fellow revisionist John Mosier in his The Myth of the Great War). He says that it wasn`t until 1918 that "The Germans, exasperated by the Allied refusal to settle for anything less than a knockout blow, were contemplating peace terms as harsh and vindictive as those the French and British imposed." (p. 480). In fact, as anyone who has read Fritz Fischer's Germany's Aims in the First World War would know, German imperial ambitions - which aimed at the effective annexation of the Low Countries and neutralization of France - were fully realized even before the end of the first year of fighting.  In his efforts to whitewash the Second Reich Fleming skips from revisionism to fantasy. "Germany's aims before the war were relatively modest," he maintains. "Basically, Berlin sought an acknowledgement that it was Europe's dominant power. It wanted an independent Poland and nationhood for the Baltic states, to keep Russia a safe distance from its eastern border. Also on the wish list was a free trade zone in which German goods could circulate without crippling tariffs in France, Italy, Scandinavia and Austria-Hungary. It is not terribly different from the role Germany plays today in the European Economic Union. But the British Tories could not tolerate such a commercial rival in 1914 and chose war." (p. 480). This paragraph includes one factual error - the Tories were in opposition in 1914 - and the rest is Niall Ferguson-inspired utterly spurious nonsense.  The real extent of Germany's imperial ambition was revealed at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which was forced on Russia in 1918 - Fleming deems this worthy of nothing more than two paragraphs on p. 197. Meanwhile, "The ongoing British blockade would become the greatest atrocity of World War I," Fleming declares (p. 296), something the Armenians, victims of outright genocide perpetrated by Germany's "halfhearted" (p. 58) ally Turkey, might take issue with.  The book is also riddled with mistakes:  Fleming says "[Media baron Lord] Northcliffe almost single-handedly revived the British Conservative Party in the elections of 1912." (p. 48). Presumably, he means the two elections of 1910.  Contra Fleming, tanks did not make their combat debut at Cambrai in 1917 (p. 220) but on the Somme a year earlier.  Fleming describes the Prime Minister of South Africa as coveting "German West Africa, a huge colony just north of his country, now known as Zimbabwe." (p. 336). In fact, Zimbabwe used to be called Rhodesia after the very British Cecil Rhodes. Fleming has it confused with Namibia.  Fleming lists Texas as a Republican gain in the election of 1920 (p. 469); in fact it stayed in the Democratic column.  In sum, this is disappointing work from a historian whose writing (his Burr-Hamilton history Duel, for example) I have enjoyed in the past. 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 Takes a long time to say nothing much...wish I had saved my money. I bought this because it was required for a class, but it's of very little real use for actually managing anything 
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 I came across this book at a local library where it was in the age group for 3rd and 4th grade reading. I don't want to read this kind of garbage nor would I want a child to read it. I found it offense and do not recommend it for anyone. The writer needs to get a life! 
 I thought this was a horrible book. Pug is an absolute bore and so infuriating becasue he is perfectly perfect in every way. He is the naval male counter part to Mary Poppins. The battle descriptions droned on forever and ever. I found myself skipping large sections just because I could not stand it any longer. No one should subject themselves to reading this book unless they have no other option including seduce the profesor 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 I am an avid reader, and I will finish a book no matter how difficult it is, or how boring it is, and I couldn't finish this one. It was so dry - and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I was really disappointed 
 This book contains reproducible mini-books, bingo cards, flash cards, some word search puzzles and fill-in activities.  In my opinion, the fill-ins are a bit too challenging.  I even had trouble with them.  The only thing in this book really "worth it" that I couldn't make as well myself, are the mini-books.  The mini-books each contain several different sight words, so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them 
 A bunch of junk.  Not any of the really meaty excersises.  An excuse for the auhor to make money 
 Obscurity is easy; artistic clarity requires discipline.  Occasionally interesting but for the most part boring in its effort to be different - like every freshman poet.  Shrill delivery.    I really wanted to like this band.  Christian background with high aesthetic standards - sounds like fodder for great discussion.  Instead, it comes off like one of those community college poetry-writing contests.  Obviously the guy is a skilled arranger but there's so much effort thrust into the listener's face: Look how hard I tried to change it up for you!  The music doesn't support the lyrics and the lyrics don't mean much of anything except possibly to the writer and one wonders if this isn't a Robert Browning situation:  "[When I wrote these words only God and Daniel Smith knew what they meant; now, only God knows.]"  What's left?  Shrill musical non sequiturs and burdensome lyrical content.  Be literary, be mysterious, but don't fall into the trap of the undereducated blowhard creating his own "mythology" because real reading, research and synthesis was too hard.  Mr. Smith has a following and a gift for arrangement - but he's short-changing his listeners and limiting his potential impact by messing about with second-rate material.  
 This is the book that has gathered together all the most annoying people in science studies -- especially the ones who flog the dead horse of 'practise'without considering the larger social and political contexts that have made the Science Wars such a hot issue. I would advise so-called Science Warriors looking for an easy target to look no further than this arboreal sacrifice. Everyone else: check out David Hess's introduction to science studies for something more reasonable and Steve Fuller's book on Kuhn for something really challenging 
 If you enjoy simile-ridden narratives of Court TV, you'll probably enjoy this book. Dialogue and narrative are pretty evenly paced, and the storyline keeps the reader modestly engaged. Is it enthralling? By no means. Are there surprises? Only who really did it at the very end, otherwise everything is pretty perfunctory and matter of fact. We know the defendant didn't do it, and the suspicion cast on a third party is too obvious from the beginning to be the real culprit at the end.   The storyline is simple: A separated defense lawyer, who has had a liaison with his former boss's wife, decides against a conflict of interest to defend her against charges that she murdered her husband. The rest is pretty much the ins and outs of the trial - and a few diversionary, inconsequential motifs about another client and the attorney's embittered wife. All in all, a fairly ho-hum read. I even considered ditching the whole enterprise about midway, but am glad I persevered. Will I read another Martini? Only the other one I bought at the same time, but I otherwise wouldn't bother. 
 I'm glad I took this book out of the library before I wasted my money on it.  The only reason I took this book out was to read Kyoko Mori's story which was about the only good one in the entire book next to "Hum" and "Epiphany".  Most of the stories in here, first off, were structured horribly and were seemingly random, jumping from point to point making the story confusing and unreadable.   As for the actual content of 80% of the book - It's all pretty much propaganda. Most of it was "Please pity me!" or "How DARE you pity me!". The usual whiny politically-correct stuff 
 As a Frank Miller fan I was looking forward to this book.  I already had the original hardcover the movie was based on.  I expected to see more than art from it repeated again.  The movie was excellent and visuals were incredible.  I am familiar with the original stand and was aware of the liberties taken in the film from actual history.  However, I was expecting something more informative along the lines of the books from Lord of the Rings series of artwork used.  Disappointing. 
 I ordered both this and Honey Nut version.  I wish I had paid more attention to the Low Fat part of this version.  This version is hard and too cinnamon/sugary which seems to happen w/ some low-fat cereals.  They compensate for the low fat by sugaring it up and end up w/ a hard less tasty and less filling product.  However, the Honey Nut version is very good.  It has good crunch, but is not too hard and has tasty almond slivers in it.  It's sweet, but not overly for granola, and no cinnamon taste at all.  I understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon and I typically like cinnamon, but this version is too much and the raisins too dried out and hard.  The package is very convenient though.  I now have to mix in the regular version w/ this product to help me get rid of the Low Fat stuff.  Some label info:  Low Fat w/ Raisin (LF) has 180 calories per 1/2 cup while Honey Nut (HN) has only 20 more at 200.  There are 12 1/2 cup servings in the HN while the LF only has 10.  Product weight is HN 24 oz and LF 20.5 oz.  Finally sugars are HN 11g while the LF has 15g 
 The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book 
 Who is this recording for? Surely not for Billy Joel fans, who would undoubtedly prefer Billy doing the actual singing. For that matter, why would anyone want to listen to 60+ minutes of Billy Joel covers? This is the most pointless cast album since Contact. Movin' Out is a similarly visual show the appeal of which lies not in Michael Cavanaugh's admittedly distinctive performance. It's no wonder you see used copies of Movin' Out is used records stores everywhere 
 Look, the kids Dad is Dr. Phil.  And good ol Dad constantly promotes his son's book on the TV show.  By the way, this kid would never get published if it weren't for his Father's pull.  Now this pampered rich kid is going to tell us how to make it in life?   How did he make it?  Daddy?  This kid could take a poop and slap a cover on it and it would still sell like hotcakes.  Why?  Regardless of the fact that it's trash, his Daddy is a best selling author with his own TV show and nepotism is alive and well 
 I bought this book because I was intrigued by the title. I expected a book that considered words used with criminal intent, in general.   I am disappointed that pornography is the only crime considered here. I wish the author had examined other kinds of cases--not to mention many many more specific examples. There is probably a wealth of legal material on such crimes, if only the author had broadened her horizons.  While I agree that pornography can be a crime, I find the author's arguments used to ban it fundamentally flawed. As other reviewers have noted, this book is argued poorly, uses a shoddy set of examples, and definitely runs afoul of logic.   Had I been interested in an anti-pornography book, I would have preferred one showing practical means to legally limit its damage.   This book does not argue cogently that the first and 14th amendments are NOT considered equally in cases of criminal use of words.  Neither does it effectively show that words can be criminal, or suggest means to prosecute such crimes. A pity.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 I loathed this book. I despised it. While every eighth grade English teacher in the U.S. may hate that I say this, I'm only telling the truth. There are characters that are so cocky and reading about them made me want to gag. Tom Sawyer as a boy and as a character seemed both annoying as a real human, and unrealistic. Becky, too, was unbelievable. No young children such as those could possibly act like that, and besides, I don't truly believe a boy Tom's age would be so cool in a cave, and rescue his lady-love.  Tom Sawyer and I just didn't get along. It's just one of those things. I suffered through reading it, though perhaps someday I'll try again, and the experience will be better 
 Its clear from reading through the book that the author has some insight into MIDP2.0 games programming and the business of getting them running well and published, however this book ultimately fails to convey this information to the user. The author starts out saying that he's not going to spend much time explaining game programming because there are many books on the subject, yet wastes precious time explaining MIDP itself - a topic for which there are considerable numbers of books available. For a book on MIDP game programming, the book actually wastes a considerable number of pages not actually building games. By the time it actually gets to the Game API (Chapter 9 on page 137/334) nearly half the book is over. Once we finish with the one "solid" chapter on the Game API all one will gain is a sampling of information about the general operation of the Game API and layers but it is explained in such little detail that you'll end up having to buy another book to get details about it.   One of the biggest letdowns of this book once it DOES start talking about the Game API  occurs when attempting to discuss working with worlds larger than the handset size - something fundamental to most games and crucial to understand for building performant games. The Author covers this entire topic in 2 paragraphs and doesn't even provide a line of code to explain it.  So misguided is parts of the book that it wastes 10 pages trying to discuss JBUilder Mobile Edition and 4 discussing Brew. These wouldn't be such outrageous wastes if the author had actually been more forthcoming in the chapter on the GameAPI in actually telling and showing people what they needed to know in order to use the Game API effectively.   Didn't actually learn anything more about the Game API than I already knew just reading the Sun website. But hey, I do know some more information about the PNG file format history. Look elsewhere. As a professional programmer in this space I found this book to be greatly disappointing. 
 To be honest, I never really had much fate in Video game adaptations. Most of them in the past have failed miserably. Here, Resident Evil Apocalyse has made it even worse. A continuation from the first so-so Resident evil film. Umberella have decided to re-open the Hive, unknowingly letting the T-Virus out throughout the city, turning the people of Racoon city into zombies. Firsts of all, I love the Resident Evil video games( especially Resident Evil 4 ). Its what gave me encouragment to see this film. Before I actually saw this film I was thinking that this might be in some way decent. To be honest, it didnt even seem in anyway related to the Resident Evil series.   When it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself, What makes the actuall game itself such a success? If you take Silent Hill for instance. Probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success. They have really taken the Silent Hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done. It actually felt like Silent Hill. But in this case, it looks like the Resident Evil video games where just thrown aside. There is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like Resident Evil environment. And the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by Heavy Metal music. It felt like an absolute joke. It seems that they didnt even take the Resident Evil video games into consideration and without it, this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the Resident Evil title. This is just a pointless action sci-fi. Film makers really need to take these video game adaptions more seriously. This is an insult to the Resident Evil video game series 
 "Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..." Oh my God was this book a snoozer. What a waste of time 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 What a difficult movie to sit through.  It went all over the place with very little character connection.  It had senseless violence, senseless nudity, and left you with nothing at the end.  I found it to be an excruciating 2.5 hours.  The sad thing is that I think Ragtime could have been really good and could have taught about social issues and history.   It could have changed peoples' understanding of prejudice, inequality, racial issues, women's history, etc. but it didn't teach or entertain. 
 Review no.618.Somewhat disappointing follow-up to their '96 'Load' CD, which was one of their better works ever,I thought. I remember SO many fans commenting how let down they were when this disc first came out. It's not so terrible,it's just nothing to get all tanked up about. Some of the tracks here,I thought were okay,are "The Memory Remains" (love the video where Marianne Faithfull makes an appearance-now THAT'S semi-original),"The Unforgiven II",the melodic "Where The Wild Things Are" and "Bad Seed". Not the worst metal release I've ever heard,by any means. Take my advise,buy a used copy of this title 
 People who claim they "loved" this gratuitous violence and debauchery-filled movie need to get a life and learn what a great movie is.  There is nothing redeeming or "important" about this movie.  It's just ugly.  
 I bought this thinking it was going to be a good healthy snack of raspberries. I was surely mistaken. The raspberries are coated with sugar, and other syrupy stuff and it tastes like you are eating gummy bears! GROSS 
 I have read both versions of this book. I tried to have an open mind. Dr. Raymond is not trying to have any sort of constructive dialogue with transpeople. She is just pushing a transphobic form of radical feminism.  It is possible to constructively critique the male dominated industry that regulates transsexual surgery but Raymond is more interested in attacking transsexual people. It is wrong to call her book the mein kampf against transsexuals but there is little positive in the book.  Perhaps someday Dr. Raymond will realize that her book has hurt transpeople and revise it yet again 
 Very disappointing.  This product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose.  The "high waist" was always rolling down.  I wasn't expecting miracles; I just wanted to smooth out my silouette while I lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight.  This product was completely useless.  Product has a clever name but that's it.  I really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item.  Look elsewhere.    
 This is a novel about a professor who is slightly cuckoo.  This is a story about a man who is filled with opinions that can not only be considered conservative for our time, but did for his time as well. I used this novel to exercise my Nabokov, and is my least favorite novel by the author.  I am glad he wrote others, because this alone would have stolen Nabokov's artistic genius.  The book is written well, but the plot is immensely boring.  I would suggest you NOT bother reading it. 
 This children's book about Galileo has very beautiful illustrations, but the history leaves much to be desired.  It's a perfect example though of how myths about the past take on a life of their own independent of historical evidence or historical context.  Sis offers another variation on the "warfare" of science versus religion  with Galileo representing the modern rational scientist (which he was not) and his opponents in the Church representing ignorant, dogmatic tradition.  Of course the reality was much more complex, especially considering that Galileo did not have proof that the earth moved.  This book shows why children are so often misinformed from an early age for the sake of telling a good story 
 Having been a fan of Redon since the early seventies, I had positive expectations for this book. I was disappointed. The text at the beginning of the book was excellent, but the actual display of his work was only mediocre. Most of the plates were small (some quite tiny) and more of his gray toned works were displayed than his art using color where his magic really shines. Most of his best color paintings, in my opinion, simply weren't in the book. Since I own a Redon book, purchased in the seventies, one that's literally filled with color plates, my first question was to wonder if the lack of them in this book was a cost saving measure. To me, it's simply not an adequate or satisfying representation of his range. I would not purchase this book had I seen it first 
 All in all useful, but not nearly enough variety in the thesaurus. Many of  the alternate words given were basically the same vein as the original.  Often If anything, most of the alternates given seemed to be a dumbed down  version of the word you were using 
 There is a lot of traffic in Rome.  Especially on the "raccordo annulare", where accidents  are also frequent. The traffic is noisy and dirty, especially when it rains.  Romans swear when they drive and also when they don't.  There are many American tourists in Rome,  especially around the fountains in the piazzas,  where they cluster and sing American songs.  Italian men hit on women tourists, who resist their advances.    "Se vedi gente che lavora, allora non e` Roma".  Romans do not work. No, some of them do, and, in fact, morning till night.   But Rome is not what it used to be.  Everybody knew each other and was polite,  while now everybody is rushed and rude.  Besides, the free love of today has substituted  the brothels of yesterday.  Yes, some of the brothels were chic, while others less so.   Rome was bombed in the Second World War. In fact,  bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical  performance. The public then proceeded to the  shelter, where flirting and lovemaking would ensue.   The Roman aristocracy is close to the Papal Court.  They run parties together, even fashion shows.  Cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the Pope  how to rule the Church.   And, yes! Motoryclists can and do go around the  Colosseum, providing a tasteless final sequence.   One leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time.   Does Fellini really have nothing at all to say  about the Eternal City? After all his years there? Nothing except the  standard collection of stereotypes  about Italians, stereotypes that occur in every  scurrilous joke, that are met on the pages of every trashy guide?    It is true that there are a few nice sequences, especially  the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes.    And then, the great Anna Magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell Fellini she won't talk to him.    That is perhaps also a scene worth watching.   But the rest is commercial cinema.   "Vai a dormi', Federico".    
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 This book attempts to link disconnected half-truths with pseudologic to push an idealogical agenda.  It is shocking an disappointing to me that in a time of war we allow enemy propaganda like this to demoralize our populace and troops. 
 Looks can deceive (title). It's a good book to learn all (almost) about windows CE but it's a pitty that only the last chapter treats a small piece of the .net approach. So if you are interested in learning windows CE in using the last visual studio 2005 beta this isn't the book need  
 I used this book to teach a bioinformatics course in a foreign language because it was only one of two available in both english and chinese.  I'm not sure it wouldn't have been less confusing to simply use a english textbook and let the students translate the text for themselves.  To give the author credit, he has compiled an enormous quantity of information and made it available in a single location and that is no mean feat.  At the very least, it is a valuable starting point to find both useful references to better explanations and software appropriate to almost any analysis you might want to do.  On the downside, the prose is a tangled mess and is beyond comprehension in places.  there are points where, even though i understand the underlying theories used throughout the book, i still couldn't figure out some of the examples used to illustrate particular methods.  For example, there are some figures which have captions which run for a page and a half.  Finally, in the majority of cases, the figures are taken directly from key papers on each topic, and associated explanations consist of sentences copied verbatim from the text.   I may be doing the author a gross injustice here, but in many of the explanations, i was left with the same impression i get when reading students papers when they have copied something out of a textbook, without really understanding what is going on.  Having said all of the above, i would still recommend taking a look at this book, but be ready to access the excellent list of references if you want a more insightful understanding of many of the methods described throughout 
 This is pretty much a commercial for the current "Dark Age". It focuses mostly  on the weaker Superman as featured in the "Justice League" and other recent tales. It skips over much of the classic appearances of Superman over the years in favor of a more so-called "cutting edge" style mostly ignoring the best writers and artists such as Boring, Anderson and Swan. No coverage of classic portrayals such as the radio and movie serials, the live action TV shows and movies. A very sparse account. Since there will be a better version when the new film comes out there is really no reason to buy this. Wait for the new and better book to be published 
 there are two tunes you can dance and they sound familiar. "FAME" by Irene Cara, 'DISCO INFERNO" by tramps "WHAT A FEELING" by Irene Cara from the movie "FLASHDANCE" its a dance  where your body spins around the floor with your back like a toy called: TOP or a YOYO. There are 2 songs you may dance to enjoy I mentioned above 
 I am not a John Wayne fan, and believe other reviewers who have pointed out the inaccuracies in 'Flying Tigers', but I'd like to have the DVD just to take me back to a time (1942) when, at the age of six, I was left with a friend in the United Artists theater on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, to watch my very first movies - this one, and 'Bambi'.  I entered that movie house a dedicated, blood-thirsty fan of blowing enemy folks to bits, and left horrified by having repeatedly watched pilots get their faces shot off behind broken canopy glass.  I had not realized there was so much bleeding in war, and that death might actually happen. Upon returning home, I told my mother, who would die, of TB, the following year, that I had become a pacifist.  'Uh huh'. she replied, knowing well my sanguinary inclinations. Of course, she was right - before very long, I was happily imagining myself flying a B-17 and creating firestorms all over Europe.  This is a VERY good movie for young children to see 
 TV is the proper forum for Dr. Phil's platitudes.  The self-induced strife of the show's guests are entertaining, and makes the viewer want to slap a little sense into them.  Dr. Phil steps in a does just that, vicariously applying the slaps, and we feel thankful to him.     Beneath Dr. Phil's oozing earnestness and rectitude there is nothing profound, original, or particulary instructive.  All the material in this book could be compressed into a few solid pages.  The rest is fluff, most of the form; "When you follow my advice, you will be happy/succeed/fix your marraige/lose weight".  He continues in this fashion, rarely specifically stating anything that might qualify as advice.  Robbins, Dyer, Mandido, Carnegie, et. al. have more to say and say it better.  
 I found this book surprisingly flat.  It was an enjoyable enough read, but Kato seems to be more interested in dropping names than building stories.  Chang's copious footnotes demonstrate this aptly -- she adds information on writers that you never "hear" from again.  I would have enjoyed hearing more story-building details from him about his friends, life abroad and in Japan, career, marriage 
 The book "Child of Fire," by Scott O'Dell is not a book I recommend to young readers. This book deals with topics that readers who are not mature enough might not understand. For example violence and drugs  are strong topics dealt with in this book. There is also a part in the book  where the topic of abortion is mentioned. This happens when Manuel's  girlfriend Yvonne tells him she's pregnant and wants three hundred dollars  for an abortion. It ends up being a lie, she just wants Manuel's money.  Either way it is still a topic that should not be exposed to young readers  in a book,but if possible by their own parents.  The book is basically  about two young boys no older than sixteen who are both leaders in rival  gangs. These two boys, Manuel Castillo and Ernie Sierra, compete against  each other to see who is braver.Manuel's way of showing bravery is by  jumping infront of a gate when the bull charges out of the tunnel.Luckily  he does not get killed but risks his life just so people can see how  "brave" he is. Ernie Sierra is a drug dealer who exports drugs  from USA to Mexico using pigeons, like the ones used to send messages. Ben  Delaney is Manuel's parole officer, who is also the narrator of the  story.Throughout the story Delaney tries to keep Manuel out of trouble. I  guess the best human concern developed  by the author is courage. Not in  the part of the two boys because killing people and selling drugs isn't  being courages,but by the parole officer Delaney. Sometimes he had to face  danger just to try to keep the two gangs from fighting.For example when he  goes to Ernie's house to prevent Manuel from killing Ernie, he is risking  his life by being caught in the middle and getting shot. Delaney is afraid  of getting shot by Ernie, but he still tries to stop him from harming  others.  Throughout the story these two boys both commit acts that are  unappropriate for children their age. Like I stated before Ernie sells  drugs and also harms anyone that gets in his way. Manuel ends up in jail  for causing a mutiny on a ship he was working on, and ends up escaping from  jail. At the end of the story Manuel Castillo ends up getting killed by a  grape picking machine. Not by accident but by displaying what he thought  was courage or bravery. He jumped in front of the machine, (just like he  did before with the bull) and did not move when it came towards him. The  machine ended up squishing him just like if he were a grape.This story  shows young readers the wrong idea of being courages, and is therefore not  a book I recommend to young readers 
 This is a BAD album DO NOT BUY IT. THIS IS NOT REAL MUSIC. Wolf Eyes does not have any real fans; simply a group of followers who like the novelty of it. People who like to show off the fact that they listen to bands like this so people think they are cool. This album has no real tempo or notes just noise, ugly noise, that is not enjoyable to listen to in any way. DO NOT listen to this album. Thank you 
 This movie was interesting enough to keep me watching to the end but I was disappointed. Maybe I missed the point, but it seemed to me that almost nothing about this movie was real. Robert Redford's character wore clothes and had furniture that seemed mostly lifted from the Sundance Catalog. Michelle Pfeiffer's character never seemed to be doing any research but rather staying late at work to play solitaire on her computer. And we later are expected to believe that she gets up from her wedding bed to work at her laptop on a news story. I found it a sad reflection on Hollywood's take on American values and an insult to the viewer's intelligence 
 This is one of those weird manufactured bands - y'know, the kind that never really toured or played much or released much - and then suddenly, mysteriously, they're signed to a major label and making more money than your parents.  First of all, these guys are upper-middle-class hipsters who pretend to be poor.  It's a schtick.  Having lived in Seattle, I've been privvy to these creeps up close.  Ben Clark is not struggling I assure you.  Their music is lightweight pop-fluff that tries to adopt the surface appeal of punk without being the slightest bit punk at all.  They have no identity of their own, and somehow it all feels way outdated.  It's those slimey major labels with their cynical idea of what makes money - they simply regurgitate what's already popular until the well runs dry.  They don't care about creativity.  They just want stupid disposable pop for stupid mall kids to spend their money on.  Some greasy white guy in a polo shirt thinks he knows what teenage girls like and so the rest of us are stuck with yet another boring disposable hunk of plastic junk.  All this while truly talented deserving bands go broke.  Go spend all your money on the Lashes 
 I am so disappointed i cried!  i know most of the players in this book and not only was the storyline awful there are a great many untruths!  save your money and borrow one if you must read it.....ugggggggggggggg please my 5 year old son could do a better job!  I love reading true crime books and no i don't think i ever want to read another, by this author at least....j 
 I HATE HEARING THIS HYPE OVER STANLEY WILLIAMS!  THIS MOVIE PROTRAYS HIM AS A CHANGED MAN, BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.  WILLIAMS HAS NEVER ADMITTED WHAT HE DID.  AS ARNOLD SAID IN HIS DENIAL OF CLEMENCY "WITHOUT AN APOLOGY AND ATONEMENT... THERE CAN BE NO REDEMTPTION."  THIS MOVIE HYPES AND BEMOANS THE TROUBLE OF TOOKIE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIMS HE BRUTALLY MURDERED?  HE KILLED AN ENTIRE TAIWANEESE FAMILY, SAVE THE SON.  IMAGINE ROBERT YANG'S HORROR FINDING HIS MOTHER DEAD, HIS SISTER NOT ONLY DEAD BUT HALF HER FACE BLOWN OFF AND HIS FATHER GASPING FOR AIR.  ALL THREE OF THEM DIED AND TOOKIE MADE FUND OF THE NOISES THEY MADE AS THEY DIED.  THEN ALBERT OWENS, THE 23 YEAR OLD 7-11 CLERK THAT WAS SHOT IN THE BACK. OWENS LEFT BEHIND 2 DAUGHTERS A FATHER AND THE STEP-MOTHER WHO RAISED HIM.  THE YANG FAMILY WAS WARNED BY TOOKIES BUDDIES(WHO ELSE WOULD DO IT) THAT THEY BETTER KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT.  IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THIS THE STRESS LITERALLY KILLED ALBERT OWEN'S FATHER.  THAT LEFT LORA OWENS(THE STEP-MOTHER) AS THE SOLE VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS.  HER LIFE WAS THREATENED YET SHE KNEW THAT TOOKIE NEEDED TO DIE FOR HIS CRIMES.  WHEN THE GUILTY VERDICT WAS ANNOUNCED TOOKIE THREATENED THE PROSECUTION AND THE JURY.  HE ALSO PLOTTED TO KILL PRISON GUARDS TO ESCAPE.  WHILE IN PRISON HE RAPED OTHER INMATES AND ASSAULTED GUARDS.  HE SURE SOUNDS LIKE A NOBEL "PEACE" PRIZE NOMINEE TO ME.  NOT ONE OF HIS SUPPORTERS MENTIONED THE INNOCENT PEOPLE THAT THIS ANIMAL KILLED.  YET WHEN HE WAS TO BE EXECUTED THEY WHINED LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW.  YOU HAD LOOSERS LIKE SNOOP DOG(WHO WAS AQUTTED OF MURDER AND IS ALSO A CRIPS GANG MEMBER) AND JESSE JACKSON.  THE VICTIMS WERE NOT ON THEIR MIND JUST THE CRAPPY BOOKS(WITH SALES OF LESS THAN 500 SO NO THEY DID NOT CHANGE LIVES) HE WROTE.  THE FOUR PEOPLE HE SHOT WERE JUST A NUMBER.  LIKE JOSEPH STALIN ONCE SAID "THE DEATH OF ONE MAN IS A TRAGEDY THE DEATH OF ONE MILLION, A STATISTIC."  THANKFULLY TOOKIE IS NOW GONE AND HIS VICTM'S FAMILIES CAN REGAIN SOMETHING OF A LIFE. MAY THIS BE THE ULTIMATE LESSON TO AT RISK YOUTH; KILL PEOPLE END UP LIKE TOOKIE.  
 Christopher Makos is proof that you don't need talent to bang out a career in photography. Besides being reviled in much of the fashion world and completely dismissed by the art world, Makos's photos are tired, old-fashioned pin-ups of handsome men. Don't confuse the beauty of the subjects for any sort of vision from the "artist." Calvin Klein's contribution does not save this mediocre effort. save your money 
 There is nothing new in this book. That doesn't mean it's bad, but all it offers is a simplistic (but helpful) rehash of what you've probably read a thousand times or more. It's sort of a two-step "Eliminate the negative, accent the positive" approach, to paraphrase the old song. Nothing wrong with it. If it helps you, fine, but the book and its little process offer  nothing original 
 I got this book a couple days ago and now understand why I am no longer a card holding Lutheran. I went to Lutheran school for nine years in the Missouri Synod. All through my life until four years ago I was paranoid and scared of Jesus coming out of the clouds. I made decisions out of "guilt" that had such a major impact on my life. Married a man that was the Christian proto type that my father wanted me to marry. Made my oldest son do  confirmation  because it was the right thing to do... and on and on.But there was never any peace. Between this book and the Mel Gibson movie I returned to the past. The sadness and the violence associated with being a Christian.It has been a bad few days. The hopelessness becomes overwhelming. It is not me. I do not believe the devil exists except in the minds of man and hell is the separation of man from Spirit. According to this book there is no redemption unless we follow the guidelines of the bible. All Buddhists and Hindus, Jews ect are never going to make it to heaven. When a family member visits us in dreams then it is the devil. NDE are the devil also. Seems the devil has way too much power according to this book. If one goes back and reads what Martin Luther did to the peasants then is this a righteous man? Yes, he was brilliant, but he was also a bigot, and contributed to the deaths of many. I threw this book away. It has also made me go forward to study Buddhism, something I have been dabbling at for some years. The Buddha was compassionate and full of love. When it comes to the end I think only love and compassion will be needed to go beyond the veil. The author should be ashamed of using fear to sell more books. Shame on me for giving her money 
 This is a truly amazing book! This is a book written by a highly uneducated person for even less educated reader. As the author says in the introduction, this book is designed for young people of all ages... Well, what's that, "young of all ages?"  Simple: those "whose imagination has not been stifled by standard educational process."  At the very outset, the author reassures the reader that the book is not going to be a technical or scientific one. He says with a poorly concealed pride "My brush with academia was a fairly short one:  I was expelled from kindergarten at the age of four... and have never managed to resume normal studies since, not to mention graduating from anyplace."  As a result, "I am a fairly stupid fellow who could not learn any mathematics at all."  This lack of really serious knowledge of anything does not prevent the author from making judgments, always with a sort of  "elegance of ignorance", regarding very big topics, like, say, theory of relativity, and holography, and brain functioning (through electromagnetic and sound vibrations), and Biggg Banggg, of course. So, my recommendation to those with at least K12 education: do not waste time and find a better way to spend $9.97.    The most surprising aspect of  this book is that Dr. William Tiller, a  respected scientist and writer, found it possible to write a preface for this book.  This preface is the best part of the book. 
 I don't know why the recipes in this book don't turn out right.  Every recipe I tried has been a disaster, not to mention required an extremely expensive list of ingredients (porcini mushrooms and arugula anyone?).  Jamie Oliver puts on a great show, but the food just doesn't seem to live up to the "easy peasy" hype. His "My favorite curry" with "Lemon rice" took almost 3 hours from prep to finish and tasted horrible.  I won't be buying another Jamie Oliver book 
 I found this to be an interesting and frustrating book. Dalton is a decent, though self-indulgent writer, who is able to create good narrative momentum. He has some interesting if not very deep things to say about race and class and childhood. But everything positive about the book was deeply undermined for me because it contains a great deal of factual error and distortion. I know this because my family figures prominently in his story. He was my brother's best friend during a critical period of their childhoods, which Dalton recounts at considerable length. And much of what he says is simply wrong. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he wrote things as he remembers them and did not deliberately embellish the story. But the inaccuracies are significant because they pertain to the very heart of what he is trying to say. When Dalton transferred to PS41, he moved into a very different socioeconomic sphere, and the contrast between his earlier experiences and the new world he entered affected him deeply. Those contrasts--and the meanings he draws from them--are a great deal of what he tries to make sense of in the book. And that is what makes his inaccuracies so troubling. The portrait he paints of my family is of an extremely privileged, wealthy clan of economic and cultural elitists. That makes a better story, but it is also false. It makes me wonder just how accurate his other memories are. Is what he says about other people, places, and experiences as distorted as what he says about my family? His book is a clear lesson in just how subjective and unreliable memoirs are as sources of information about anything or anyone other than their authors. If you read this book, you'll know what Dalton thinks his childhood was like. No more, no less 
 This book is long on formula derivation, and short on DOE theory.  It does not introduce readers to DOE software packages like it claims either.    Also, very poor on real life examples.  They exist....but not enough details in order to understand them.  I am looking to teach a corporate class on this....too bad the book doesn't come with the professor.

 This novel could not hold my interest.  I am an Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book.  I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her.  Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series.   
 I tried my very best to like this book. I gave it two hundred pages to get my attention, but it just bored me.   The characters didnt interest me in the least bit, and the story was just to slow. I went to sleep three times trying to read it. I just gave up after awhile.   To all out there looking for a good Alien Invasion read I suggest Footfall, or The Forge of God. I just cannot recommend this book 
 Unfortunately there are not much words to loose. Poor writing together with the fact that practically all facts were lifted from Cameron's 'Conversation with Wilder' which is highly recommended btw, make this book forgettable. Why going through the whole exercise of publishing it is quite a mystery 
 I agree with the comment earlier that there is no why in the end.  Every reader wants to know why he committed such a heinous act.  If it is greed, greed is too simple for this book because everybody is greedy in one way or another.  Please, next time Grafton, let us in on the reason for a person's demise, especially if you have the audacity to take us back 30 years.  
 Bush is winning the war on terror?    Who here is sufficiently blissfully ignorant to still believe that?  Iraq has completely imploded--even CENTCOM has acknowledged that we are fast approaching "chaos" and total anarchy there.  Bush's occupation there is effectively at an end.  As for Afghanistan, the military now admits that the Taliban is making a major, widespread resurgance, and now controls much of the country.  Our recent bid to push back at their growing offense ended in failure. In fact, we now only control the capital of Kabul, and that only tenuously.  Of course, Bin Laden still runs free, laughing at those he killed on 9/11.  No, the sad, plain truth is that Bush is not in any way, shape or form winning the war on terror.  This book has simply become a pathetic relic of a bygone era, useful only as an object of sarcastic mockery and derision.  Bush, like those who believed in him, has become nothing more than a very sad joke. 
 Road depiction is very vague. Difficult to read. Somewhat useable with AAA maps. For the best maps see the series by Benchmark Maps. I have used their maps in New Mexico, California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona. Unfortunately, they do not have many states. I use the Delorme "Utah" with my AAA maps 
 Sorry, Babs.  You can't call yourself a Christian and also be so judgmental about your son or the so-called "homosexual lifestyle."  If we're throwing labels around, we might just as well call it "the heterosexual lifestyle." Gimme a break; it's 2004, lady. 
 Can't comment on the content because both the first and second copies I received were not legible. What happened at the printer's? No quality control check, apparently, before these books were shipped for sale 
 I am always looking for quality nutricious treats for my teens. I bought the samplers to see if anyone had a favorite. Sorry to say that we just did not like any of these. A little too spicy and we were looking for crunch and got chewy. 
 With the exception of Missy, and Lil kim track, this whole cd will make a great coaster at best. The only who can truly enjoy this album is someone who has a one track mind for partyin' only. This is no hip hop compilation. Straight dance to the fullest. Pop for the most part. And tracks of hits that i didn't even no was hits, by a rapper almost no one cares about. Even though I do like some of what he puts out but still, addin yourself on hits album just make people diss him more 
 Please make sure that when you're buying this book, you're not under the misconception that this is by any means a nutritional book.  I was looking for dietary hints from people who I thought would be most in tune with their bodily needs.  Instead, I received a book full of 'feel the burn' and 'maintain discipline' lifting slogans and little useful information for anyone who is not preparing for a competition.  If that's what you're looking for, this is a wonderful book for you.  For useful insites into nutrition and lean muscle mass correlation to your daily diet look somewhere else 
 The paintings in this book were of very poor quality.  Some were even smeared.  Couldn't wait to send this back 
 Gift of Gab's first solo album, 4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up, is a candidate for most adequate release ever.  Typically motor-mouthed Blackalicious emcee Gab usually draws you to his tracks with an exceptional delivery, but here, little stands out as exceptional.  Unfortunately, even less seems as though it will be remembered in a couple of years.  On the positive side, the beats never get truly wretched nor does Gab get completely boring.  It's just hard to call any of these songs better than OK.  Even "decent" would be pushing it.  "Sufficient?"  That's more like it.  For production alone, tracks "Way of the Light" and "Hold On" shimmy above the rest, meanwhile the gimmicky "Flashback" and "The Writz" fall flat.  An album full of tracks as energetic and inspired as "Just Because" would stand the test of time, but "Rat Race" and most of the other faceless songs began fading away just after their release 
 Santana Has no Lyrics.  All He says Is Im Crack and Dipset.  With oNly 4 good songs that not enough to buy the album but download it instead.There It Go,Oh Boy,Mic Check, and Make it work for u.  Make it work for u being the best since it has THE BEST RAPPER ALIVE WHEEZY BABY IN IT and also young jeezy whos good at lyrics like lil wayne.  Maybe Juelz should copy real rappers Like WHEEZY and Jeezy.  BIG UPS TO CARTER  
 This book has taken photo after photo straight out of the Ikea catalogue! Obviously, the authors have decided that they have nothing to offer and opt instead to refer to Ikea's design and storage ideas. This book actually put me in a bad mood. Listen up folks, THE IKEA CATALOGUE IS FREE. Do yourselves a favour and pick one up, because none of these so-called "organization" books have anything to teach you that cannot be found at your local Ikea store. These authors should be fired. Shame on both of them 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 The first unit I got wouldn't charge the ipod nor would the cd player read any cd's.  Called iLuv tech support on the weekend and got a message that mailbox was full try again later.  I returned it and got a second unit.  Once again, the cd player wouldn't read any cd's.  Tech support did answer this time when I called during office hours 8-5pm EST.  But could offer no solution.  Return it a second time and I won't purchase it again 
 This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable.  I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book.   In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story...  
 I unfortunately could not get through this book. T.R just went on and on, getting a bit carried away with his own wit and literary skills. I wish  I could write a better review, but I can't get past the second chapter. Perhaps further on down the road I will give it another try. In the meantime I recommend all Tom's other novels. 
 Zack comes up with really dynamic concepts for books.  I wish her career well.  However, I wasn't thrilled by this book.  Zack edits an anthology on "microdiversity", basically investigating the fac that there is more diversity within races than between races and mixed-race individuals substantiate this.  Zack basically goes back and forth on whether racial categories should be used strategically or obliterated.  The anthology has some interesting pieces from Native Americans.  It is lacking on pieces from Latinos.  It is very academic: everyday fans of Maria Root's books may be stumped here.  The book ends with this awkard, unnecessary essay by a Jewish woman that is not even bi-religious.  This book isn't terrible, it's just that there are better books on multiraciality out there 
 This book was very short and is mostly a book of lists.  For instance, there are chapters titled "Some of the fine Asian traits", "Things Asians are good at", and "30 ways to impress Asians".  The author then provides the list with a very short and sometimes no explanation of each point.  Then the chapter is over.  Obviously from the title, I expected the book to be somewhat racist since it generalizes about all Asians.  That being said, I found much of the advice to be almost common sense or not particular about Asians at all.  For example, some ways to impress Asians are "Having a good sense of humor, being highly educated and knowledgeable, being rich and famous, successful, being clean and neat, being tall, being a good lover," etc.  I'm not a woman, but I would think these traits are not particular to attracting Asian women but all women.  There is another chapter titled "Where to meet Asians".  Some of the places are "Asian supermarkets, Asian restaurants, Asian grocery stores, bookstores, department stores, libraries, museums", etc.  In other words, you can meet Asians any place that is Asian or any place there are people.  Hmmmm (sarcasticly).  I wonder if there are any Asians in China?  The only reason I did not give this 1 star is because I found the chapter about cultural things, which was in total 5 pages, mildly informative.  I found the author put very little effort into writing this book and wouldn't be surprised if it were written in a weekend 
 I think the shaver works well,but the plastic is thin and cheap. The biggest complaint is that there is no carring case for the razor,cleaning brush and charger. I think the cost should of been higher if that is what it takes to provide a case 
 The subtitle of this book is "Scholarship, Policy, and Practice" and this feels like something that is part-social work, part-therapy, and part-public policy.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing.  Are too many cooks spoiling the soup?  Perhaps this book is best for directors of Latino non-profits or governmental agencies in Latino communities.  I particularly like the section of the book that focuses on specific populations; namely Latino fathers, and Central American refugee families.  Too many books on Latinos stress the same old stuff (Latinos are diverse; their numbers are increasing; language and immigration will be an issue unlike with most blacks or whites, etc.).  So this book was definitely trying to do something special.  I just don't know if they effectively acheived their goal(s) 
 I just bought my unit on ebay. It was a refurbished model directly from Sony. My main (only) purpose in buying the unit is to transcribe several hundred cassettes onto CDs. After realizing I didn't have the right blanks, I went out and got what should be the right blanks ( Memorex CD-R digital audio). The unit SHOULD accept any commeercial sold blank as long as it is in the right format. That got me to where I could see that the disks were being read and appeared to be recording. With some problems, I was able to "finalize" a disk, however, it doesn't play in either the A or B drive nor on my regular CD player. I read where one guy said you have to use Sony blanks. I'm going to try that as a last effort. If that doesn't work, I'm probably gonna return it and just leave my cassettes alone. Soundwise, they are fine. It's a matter of storage and space. I tried to record an LP and that didn't even appear that it was recording by way of the sound bars. I'm gonna keep trying for now, but this unit has gotten an awful lot of bad press. I have a Sony dual cassette player that works fine, but this item may not fall into that category. So, to sum up. So far I can't record and LP to CD, I haven't been able to transfer cassette to CD that finalizes and plays, and I haven't been able to record a CD to CD. That sounds like three strikes and you're out to me. Any CDs I burn will be done on my computer. That's much faster than what this unit could do and the reproduction quality has been excellent. Since writing my review, I followed the advice of a reviewer to use only Sony blanks. They must be the CD-R digital audio type or they won't work. I was able to successfully record a cassette to CD and it sounded great. I hope my problems with the unit are behind me now and I am encouraged to make further copies 
 Oh yes I remember the Bush copresidency and presidency. Those arms for hostages, or broken tax promises don't escape your mind too easily. Neither does the long 1990-91 recession, or the wag the dog war in Iraq, against a former Reagan era ally. In this book, Shrub Senior hides his true colors and attempts to show a man with "decency" to contrast to the "immoral" Clinton at the time of publishing, in 1999, and to help his dimwitted son get elected. It didn't fool me. One look inside, and I knew everything had the truth value of "Read my lips: NO NEW TAXES". His 1000 points of light is a thousand lines of lies. Save your money. If you wanna read about people like Bush, read Pinocchio 
 opened the sealed DVD case and Get Shorty was inside and not the Usual Suspects.   I sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement.  I got a credit, I think.  Not sure.  I would rather just have the correct movie 
 How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding 
 Author La Guardia mentions how the Lemba of Africa have the Jewish gene. Fine! But when he deals (in several pages mind you)with the Falashas (also of Africa) he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these Jews NOT to be descended from the 12 Tribes of Israel despite the Falashas's longtime rep for possibly being a Lost Tribe of Israel which, again, has now been 100% disproven through genetic studies 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
  I was about to get in touch with you because my purchase has been a disaster. All 3 DVDs are not compatible with the European standards, and it says on the back of at least one of them that the item are not allowed to be sold outside USA and Canada. I did of course not recognice this before I had given them away as a present to my parents, they had for such a long time wanted these movies. It was a sad moment when they put the first DVD in the DVD player. So they are of course all unwrapped because I was sertain that a well known company like yours did not fool around with theyr customers......I am so dissapointed.I had to pay toll on them as well when they came to Norway, so if I get 3 new ones send I will have to pay toll once more???? Then the purchase is becoming rather expensive for me. So what can you do to make amends? I am rather angry about this. Rang 
 I got sucked in by the title--it is a good one. Unfortunately, the quality goes down from there.  This book is just incredibly naive about product development in the technology industry. Suggesting that the primary mantra of technologists is, "If we build it, they will come," the author (a self-proclaimed change expert) uses a mixture of 20/20 hindsight and shifting definitions to explain why a variety of stupid ideas (Webvan, satellite phones) failed. As to the success stories--like flat-panel TVs--people buy them because they're "cool." Thanks for the insight, Pip.  I read this right after finishing "The Long Tail"; a book that I expected to be a stretched-out version of a magazine article, that was surprisingly interesting and full of reasearch-driven insights. This is written more like a long, smarmy movie review. Unless you're marooned on a desert island with it, you'd be much better off re-reading, "Crossing the Chasm. 
 I will not be passing it on to a friend.  The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head?  I will not buy another Picoult book.  I felt "snookered" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.  I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair.  Why didn't I know that before?  Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions.  
 I tried.  I really tried to get into the stories of this collection.  Unfortunately, I was totally turned off by the self-pity of the characters in the various stories.  I too come from a very modest, almost crushing poverty, but I have never let it define me as so many of the characters do in this anthology. This is not my idea of written entertainment.  Angist goes just so far..and then it becomes tedious 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 This terrible movie has singing!  Bad singing, and lots of it!  Overacted, trite, and BORING!  All those good reviews, I thought it would be campy and cool, but it's NOT!  
 Being an avid enthusiast of the drum n' bass "scene," as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is, in listening to this Cd I feel this is not a strong representation of the genre. This could very well be  personal, (so you headz chill) but this type of jazzy, tech-step like, a  cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled  with..well..."filler."  I realize that during 1998 this was where  it was at for Grooverider. He was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b  fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts.   This album has a few choice cuts, and his production skills are  commendable, but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre  is definately an abuse of power.  The loungy progressions are worn thick,  and lacking any true creativity deep down.  This album comes nowhere near  stuff on the "Prototype Years" ep which was showcasing the fine  talents of heavy hitters Dillinja, Ed Rush, Fierce, Lemon D, Optical, and  Boymerang, to name a few.  It goes without saying that Grooverider has been  one of the most respected and talented DJ's, probably getting all of these  afforementioned producers their starts.  A big name gets alot of support   and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom.  No one would  dare defy that Grooverider's attempt at making d n b is off key, but let's  not give in to someone's production skills because they are graciously  empowered in the scene like a king.  Purveyor's of fine drum n' bass can  find sanctuary elsewhere.  Stick with your records for the best 
 From the Playboy pics, it looks like she is on steroids, too. Trophy wife, but aren't trophies made of plastic 
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 This is the first novel I have read by this author and after reading it, I am not likely to read any thing else by her.  I managed to finish the novel but it was more of a chore than a pleasure.  It wasn't bad enough not to finish but I am sure am glad that I didn't purchase it.  I would have wasted my money.  I have a friend who likes to read as I do and we share/pass books to each other...this one, I don't think I will share 
 Like most great diplomatic moments, successes and failures alike, decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the Camp David debacle can appear.  Even then, disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after.  Given the wide interest in the Israeli-Arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations, new works exploring the crucial climax at Camp David remain welcome.  Some dismiss Mr. Swisher's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team, but instead was responsible at Camp David only for negotiations.  That seems to me unfair.  Clayton Swisher clearly did considerable "leg work" to prepare this text; sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect.  Mr. Swisher's book follows on the heels of Dennis Ross's interesting "The Missing Peace" and, given Mr. Ross's direct involvement in the negotiations; no one could be blamed for looking at other works as well.  However, Mr. Swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at Mr. Ross's feet, even when he makes claims that others at Camp David, many more central then Mr. Swisher directly contradict his statements.  Much for example is made in this work of Mr. Ross's change of "municipal Jerusalem" to "greater Jerusalem" in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement.  Unfortunately, Ross's change in fact was a return to an earlier draft after being changed by Robert Malley, a member of the US team and now often a talking head representing the Palestinian point of view, who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties.  Malley has never denied this.  Moreover, days would pass before the negotiations actually broke down.  Swisher's target, perhaps seeking to sell books by putting forward a contradictory point of view, shifts the blame wherever he can to Israel and the US negotiating team.  While such an effort might well be reasonable, Mr. Swisher often twists facts, making excuses for Palestinian gaffs while blowing minor facts out of all proportion.  For example, Mr. Swisher brushes aside the days lost when Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian team insisted that Jews had no historic link to Jerusalem or the Temple Mound -- a position farcical on its face -- as mere posturing.  However, he never mentions that such ideas, undermining the Jewish people very claim to the Land, serve only to inflame the parties and make agreement almost impossible.  Nor does Swisher ever consider the Palestinians failure to negotiate in good faith, treating every Israeli offer simply as a new base line, rather than offering any proposals of their own.  Again, even Robert Malley concedes that this disingenuous strategy by the Palestinians likely doomed Camp David from the start.  Swisher's dismissal of all Israeli concerns reaches a crescendo when he simply casts aside as silly Israel's interest and the Palestinian's refusal of any compromise for the so-called "right of return," or the claim that all Palestinian who left the area of modern Israel and all their descendants must have a right immigrate to Israel, a right held by no other people.  As to the simple fact that this would lead to the destruction of the Jewish State and that the Palestinians are thus expecting Israel to commit national suicide, on this problem Mr. Swisher remains silent.  Lastly, one cannot help but marvel at Mr. Swisher's odd coverage of the events after Camp David.  That Yasser Arafat led a bloody war against Israel rather than offering an alternative proposal for peace is dismissed.  Mr. Swisher combs through events searching for, magnifying, and twisting any event that will make Israel look bad, while at the same time minimizing or even ignoring the waves of suicide terrorists who have murdered hundreds of Israeli civilians in cold blood.  Mr. Swisher even parrots points of Palestinian propaganda so thoroughly disproved that even Palestinian leaders no longer mention them, such as the claim of massacres during Israeli operations in Jenin, which exhaustive study long ago proved to be nothing more than a fabrication.    Curiosity will cause readers to ask why Mr. Swisher takes this extremely biased view.  Fortunately, he lays out his rather simplistic point of view at the very beginning of the book by writing the following, "The primary reason for Arab and Muslim anger against America has been and remains unbridled support for Israel's oppression of the Palestinians."  Again, one can only muse as to why Mr. Swisher does not take Osama bin Laden at his word when he spoke shortly after 9/11 that his hatred manifests from the presence of American Christian soldiers in the heart of Islamic holy lands like Saudi Arabia and later Iraq.  Surely neither the bombings in Madrid or more recently in London had anything to do with Israel, but it seems for Mr. Swisher's simplistic world view, it is at the door step of the Jewish state where all blame is to be laid.   
 The guy makes his liberal points like gangbusters. But why on earth is this type of material required reading in several colleges without an equally substantial pro-capitalist book to counter it?  Nowhere else in society are young people exposed to such raw indoctrination as they are in America's college campuses. Kids need to learn to think for themselves, not just repeat the rantings of their instructors.   
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 I read this book last year, and was moved by it, though I often found it rather fuzzy on certain details, and the chronology seemed to jump around. Now, I learn this guy is a total FRAUD: He's not Indian and Tommy didn't exist. He's apparently lazy, too: I've read that his descriptions of Navajo culture don't fit with reality, either. This is disgraceful, both his lying about his heritage, and inventing this sick child, as well as the other people he made up.  What a waste of time.  So many literary frauds have been exposed this month (Jan 06). Now, I'm wondering about a few other memoirs that have been popular the last few years. I'm rather disinclined to buy any memoirs these days; and I bet I'm not the only one who feels this way. I bet these scandals hurt sales of this book genre. 
 At the present time I am being forced to read this book in my Honors Seminar class, and for the life of me, I cannot find why I should enjoy this book as much as my professor does.  This book is incredibly boring.  My eyelids are heavy and if I did not have a paper to write on this thing, I would throw it to the bottom of my bed (never to open it again) and go to sleep.    For me, this book reads like a transcribed tape.  Of course it has an editor, but I really feel like I'm listening to this man talk---which is not always a bad thing. Some [read: better and more interesting] books work well that way, but not this one.  This book has me wondering, "why do I care about this?" and "who are these people?" These questions signal that it is very easy for a reader to get lost in the jumble.   Wow, just writing a REVIEW of this book is making me sleepier. Read this if you must.  If you have some burning desire to learn more about Russell Simmons, then enjoy. 
 I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier 
 I always wince a bit when Americans (and, really, most other nationalities) are all too confident when they poke fun at the French.  But sometimes the French play into the hands of such a characiture.  If one were in search of evidence that French films are obscure, despairing, and full of gratuitous sex dressed up as high art, Rendez-Vous should be exhibit A.  It is almost a parody of a crappy, pretentious, and completely joyless arthouse film.      Having escaped to Paris in order to "live life," Nina does quite the opposite.  The dingy depiction of the Paris underscores the impression that the city is more of a meat grinder than a place of discovery or liberation.  Early on in the film, we interupt Nina at the theater while as she is about to mount the usher.  He proceeds to treat her terribly, he insults her, and a pattern is born.  Nina will continue to attract and be drawn to men who abuse her.  Yet she is not simply a passive victim in this game.  Paulot, who arranged her lodging, seems at first to have the normal attraction to Nina.  Surely, this attraction is sexual, but it is not exclusively sexual.  We can easily imagine Paulot, if he had never been humiliated by her, desiring a normal relationship.  But as Nina later admits to her theater director, she would not sleep with Paulot.  He is sweet, and she tells Paulot that she loves him, but that is not enough.  She is drawn to something more sinister.  Paulot's behavior at the end of the film is disgusting and degrading, but I didn't feel that this was inherent to his character.  Nina has left her mark, Paulot becomes what he must be to have her.  Nina is not "living life" in Paris, she is emotionally dead, and is making the same of others.  Surrounding her relationships is a storyline concerning a production of Romeo and Juiliet, its director, and a tragedy involving its previous stars.  How this pertains to Nina is unclear, but the idea that "the sins (or tragedies rather) of the father will be visited on the son" comes to mind.   This film is not erotic, and Nina is not sexy.  We see no evidence of her desires and there is not one loving or tender second in this movie.  She runs head long into misery and sometimes can return it in kind.  Ulitmately, she is a little girl who is destroyed by Paris.  So what does the film want to portray?  Utter despair and humiliation?  How French!  I gave the movie 2 stars because I wasn't compelled to turn it off.  While I didn't like the movie, and won't recommend it, I was still kept reasonably interested, and do like watching Juiliette Binoche.  I hung on for some kind of redemtion, but it never came.  I guess that would be too sentimental, or bourgeios. It's a shame, because I do like many French movies, and movies that do something unusual.  
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 I purchased this book expecting a decent sized paperback.  I was very disappointed to see that it was spiral bound with a laminated cover and pages that looked like they had been xeroxed.  The content of the book is OK if you already have a job in the industry, but if you are looking for something entry level like myself, you will be disappointed.  My advice? Don't waste your money, you can find all of the information in this book on the internet

 Everyone that wrote reviews was an adult and they loved the film. I don't understand why. My teacher showed the fim maybe when i was in third grade. I'm 23 and am still completely creeped out by this movie. A big red balloon hovering outside a little boy's window, following him around bc he has no other friends? not okay, i'd never show this to childre 
 Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes 
 Skepticism  can be healthy, but this book is an error-filled celebration of hollow, misleading cynicism delivered with a surprising level of shallowness and lack of detail.  Sure this book points out some "legitimate" frauds and hoaxes, but it does a lot of damage and leads people astray by suggesting that a lot of things are frauds and hoaxes that are not. It seems that Mr. Randi concludes that anything and everything he doesn't understand or have proof of is a fraud or hoax. One example: acupuncture.  Never mind that thousands,  if not millions of people have been helped and healed by acupuncture, but even the American Medical Association has concluded that it is a legitimate medical therapy. But Randi includes it in his list of frauds and hoaxes.   There are many other examples where Randi errs and misleads, or simply does not understand and chooses to cast aspersions (p on) what he is woefully ignorant about. In some cases he cites individuals who have supposedly exposed frauds or disproven claims and theories, but the reader is left with little or no details to assess the claims of the "fraud buster."    In other cases, a supernatural feat is presumed to have been disproven simply because someone else has managed to appear to replicate the supernatural feat by using sleight-of-hand or other trickery.    Not everything that is real and true can or needs to be proven by science or  proven to Mr. Randi. (A large portion of the history of science, in fact, is a history of proving that what science once concluded was unreal or unprovable is in fact real.)  If you accept on face value  everything that Mr. Randi wants you to accept, your life will be much poorer for it.   This book will provide great reassurance for people who don't want to believe in anything other than their egos. As stated above, this book is a great example of where skepticism has fallen victim to cynicism and that makes this book more harmful than helpful.  To a great extent,  I am very surprised and sorry to conclude, this book itself is a fraud 
 While I Was Gone, by Sue Miller, reads suspiciously like a blend of the steadily increasing numbers of this genre of WASP apologist novels. To my jaded eyes, these offensively scrupulous tales appear to be written for WASP C Average women college graduates of A plus incomes.  I am certain that many of these readers will consider themselves more well-read and better understood for having consumed a stack of this stuff by similar writers. Somehow, WASPS everywhere will feel that instead of being emotionally constipated and terminally civilized, that they are, as usual, better than everyone else who isn't like them.  The characters, including the animals, are for the most part, good-looking, privileged, educated, and eminently acceptable. Suspension of disbelief is just not happening here. This novel pays some token hommage to the strife of teenage parenting and the shoals of marriage. Yet, it remains smug and self-satisfied conveying beyond a shadow of a doubt that these superior folks are going to soldier on and become even better than they already are for having erred on the side of humanity.  Ugh! Just once it would have been nice to experience a character like Jo screaming at her minister husband Daniel to cease his sadistic sanctimonius silent cruelty and put himself in her place. Alas, no, that sort of low-class behaviour can never exist in the rarified world of the dazzlingly narcissictic humble.  I would exhort Sue Miller to redeem herself by writing about some low-born WASPS who know how to crochet toilet roll covers and make gloppy casseroles while drowning in some decently offensive hypocracy 
 I ONLY READ THIS BOOK B/C I HAD TO FOR ONE OF MY MANY ENGLISH COURSES, AND IT WAS EXTREMLEY BORING! MAYBE B/C I JUST IM NOT ATTRACTED TO BOOKS ABOUT POLITICS, AND IN THIS CASE FASCHISM.I'LL GIVE LEWIS THE CREDIT FOR PREDICTING WHATS ALREADY SEEMING TO HAPPEN IN 2006 U.S.A, BUT THIS BOOK IS PRETTY DANG BORIN'...SORR 
 This product is nice at first but you'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don't have to put anymore holes in your home.  I've bought 5 of them over 4 years.  We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking.  DO NOT BUY, buy something better and higher quality so that you won't have to replace in 6 months.  PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW.  IT WILL SAVE YOU 
 My Son loves these books. However, the flaps rip off very easily. He really misses these books! Without a lot of effort or very aggressive "lifting", these flaps on several of Karen Katz's books ripped right off.  Great books, but need to re-engineer these for toddlers and better wear & tear 
   This is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet. I request you to do the needful. Thanking you Prince Georg 
 Definitively this book is a very bad fairy tale. For instance: The prologue has three chapters and the only one that matters is the Air Force One's chapter. So you can skip the other two chapters as well as the epilogue.  Once you just skip those three chapters, the book goes fast paced until the persecutions began. How many persecutions can you read in a book? So to keep this review short. After the third persecution you'll start to bore of reading.  But the book's finish is scrumptiously preposterous. I don't know if there is or not a lost world -myself wrote a book about that- but traveling in time is just distraught. 
 A very useless book if you are looking for what ails Hosta's and what to do about these problems. If you are having any problems, don't waste your money on this book as I have 
 Contrived, bloated, disconnected, unrealistic to the extreme. The good Wolfsschanze, the bad Wolfsschanze, the Nachrichtendienst, the Odessa, the Sonnenkinder, the Rache...good god, what does Ludlum do but think up another covert cult when he needs a new plot twist or another shoot-em-up-scene? The motivations of all these various groups are weak and thin and improbable.  Trying to keep it all straight is difficult, made more so by that fact that each is just a thin veneer for a plot twist. After a while you no longer care. For those interested in the general plot, a much better alternative would be Robert Harris's "Fatherland. 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 This book basically takes a standard project implementation methodology and applies it to ITIL in an attempt to claim that the book will enable organization's to implement ITIL processes.  The book did not help us get any close to implementing ITIL 
 This book hosts an interesting debate on the major issues in public education.  It brings out some very good points, but also uses poor logic and one sided arguments.        For example, the author proposes to debunk the myth that teachers need to be paid more by stating that they only work 7 hours a day, 9 months of the year.  He claims that teachers make an average of   $40,000+ a year and are thus making over $30 an hour.  He claims that accountants and other professionals don't make nearly that, thus implying that teacher should be happy they are getting paid as much as they are for the little they are doing.      The truth is that some teachers who have 15 years seniority and a masters degree can make $40,000, but starting teachers make closer to $28,000.  I also don't know a single teacher who works only seven hours a day five days a week.  If they did it would mean they came to school right when the students did, and left when they did, and did nothing outside of school.  Most teachers arrive well in advance and go home long after the students, often supervising multiple activities, sports, clubs, and other programs for which they may get a couple hundred dollars a year.  So, what is the real hourly wage?  For a teacher who really works from 7:30 to 5:30, plus an hour of prep at home to grade papers, write lessons plans, and prep for the next day, plus time on the weekends to grade more papers a real teacher works closer to 57 hours a week instead of the authors suggested 35.  Also, school is in secession nine months out of the year, but that doesn't mean teachers only work for nine months.  Over the summers they are attending workshops, taking additional college classes to try and jump to the next pay scale so they can take care of their families.  They also come back to school and start working as much as a month before students arrive to set up the next year and revise curriculum.  Many do work part time jobs during the summer, but their hours and pay are limited by the time commitment of the classes they are taking, and by the problems associated with jobs that will let you work for three months (did somebody say McDonalds?)   With these new factors taken in, what is the wage of a college graduate teacher? The hourly wage for a teacher in their first several years is closer to $12 an hour, a far cry from the authors distorted number of $30 which can only be achieved in reality by someone with 30 years experience and a Ph.D.  Unfortunately this lapse in logic is typical of most arguments in the book.      With all the distortions the author does make good points concerning what to do about those teachers who are only putting seven hours in and are getting paid the same.  The book is an interesting read, but check the facts on both sides before you believe all the propaganda from either side of this debate.  
 Sloppy, trite lyrics, way too much quitar. These guys don't know what their doing. Massively over-rated.  Belle and Sebastian are 100 times better than this crap band 
 I had hear good things about this book. Unfortunately. they were mistaken. By trying to cover both knitting & crocheting, the author doesn't give adequate coverage to either one. The instructions are not nearly detailed enough. The patterns are the same as any other how-to book and could easily be found online for free. This book should have been split into separate books for each craft so more detail could be given for each one. 
 This is sad, dirty & depressing tale. Although Kate Christensen writes beautifully, I couldn't have cared less about this pathetic character.  It lacks wit and humor and the reviewers who said "it's laugh out loud" funny are the kind of people who laugh at car wrecks. Any cleverness or wit is lost in the dark tone that overrides the entire story.  Skip it 
 I loved this series and have been eagerly awaiting this installment.  I found it boring, dated - the characters who used to be so distinct, vibrant and hilarious were flat and one-dimensional.  Blah......... 
 simply put, this album is terrible.  This is not anywhere near the high standard of these guys. Nothing worth anything.  Stay Far Far away from this 
 Read some reviews that say "my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day," and ask yourself - wouldn't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much TAP WATER and walking a mile a day?!  This water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value. If you won't drink water and exercise unless you have "special" water imbued with mythical powers, than by all means, this is the product for you. But if you prefer to save your money, simply exercise, eat healthier, and drink regular tap water 
 John Ashcroft has written a book detailing his job as attorney general for president George W. Bush's first term.   The title, 'Never Again' refers to his feelings for the political bent he brought to the position whereby he was as much an extension of the White House as any other administration appointee. The title also refers to his reaction to the 9/11 attacks -after the attacks he determined that commercial air travel was too dangerous for the top law enforcement official in the land, in this case, 'Never Again' refers to taking DOJ jets for all transportation -so at least he could be safe.  It may also reference his atempts to help the administration blame everyone but themselves for the attacks, irrespective of the fact that the president was warned on Aug. 6 2001; George Tenet, J. Cofer Black and separately, Ricard Clarke tried to warn the administration what could possibly happen as a result of terrorist attacks in this country 
 This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one 
 Alright, I downright hated this book! All it talks about how this part Chincoteague part Thoroughbred becomes a superstar like all of the horse books that are written now. It is like no duh the horse is going to win because the horse is the main character of the book! And, what kind of nickname is "Twi"? It's downright stupid. I just hated this book and I can not believe that some many people actually like this book. I think that the best illustration was when the ugly rat had her ribs sticking out. The worst was when she was doing all of the dressage moves. I mean, they only teach those moves at the Spanish Riding School, so Rat should not know them, especially a near perfect capriole 
 I have several crockpot cookbooks, and this one is my least favorite of all. Most of the recipes are very unusual, and they are no where close to being easy, common recipes that the average cook would like to cook in  her/his crockpot. If you like cooking unusual dishes, and you enjoy using  your crockpot, then buy this cookbook. But if you're looking for a crockpot  cookbook with great, common, family-type recipes, then pass this cookbook  by 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 I chose this book to read for my history class. It is quite boring! Only about 10% of the book is interesting. It is so oddly written. The writer goes from personal experiences, to historical facts, to "Did you know?" facts and then attempts to tie it all together at the end of each chapter. Yes, some of the facts are interesting, but you don't know if they are true. He hardly talks about the Indians of America. He always refers back to the Incas or the South Africans or some other weird "Indian" that I have never heard of. I couldn't stop falling asleep while reading it either! If you don't want to be bored and confused, do not buy this book!!! 
 Make no mistake; I love Bryan Ferry.  I got this album after hearing "Falling in Love Again" (which granted is one of the rare winners on this crooner's CD) at a restaurant.  The rest of the CD is so-so, and Ferry's voice wavers surprisingly over some of the note arrangements.  Instead of the robust voice that melts thorugh songs like "Limbo" and "More than This," his performance is oddly tinny.  Stick to his Roxy Music catalog 
 I just received my copy yesterday and am up to the beginning of the "D" section (the movies are listed alphabetically) and I've already been disappointed by numerous factual errors by the writer (writer rather than "author" because the title "author" carries with it a certain level of professional expertise which seems scarce in this book).  For example, her description of the story line for Creature from the Black Lagoon obviously is confused with the story line for one of the sequels to that film and is totally wrong.  Most disappointing 
 Giddens doesn't provide new arguments to the globalization theme.  The arguments he does present are underdeveloped and could use much more solid backing up.  I found myself confused many times by his circular arguments.  The book ends awkwardly, the writing is choppy, and his stance is vague 
 The jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap-stick sight gags. I normally wouldn't have bought a movie like this but I needed it to make my Johnny Depp library complete 
 This is not the worst book ever to grace the shelves of a library. Next time you enter one, take a look at the mystery/thriller section. I myself am an avid reader, perhaps 150 books a year. Most of them are in the mystery genre. Yet when confronted with a mystery section that has been compiling books for sixty years its hard to say that even 5% of the authors are familiar to me. Most of the books are covered with decades of dust and forgotten tombs of years gone by. That is the way 'Shadow Account' strikes me as being remembered in the years to come. It is a book you will find at the bottom of stacks in yard sales and church functions. This is not a book or an author whom like Chandler, Christie, or Hammett will be read far into the future.  The writing is plodding, sections of the novel are well done, but the tempo and style of these individual pieces clash with other sections so that you are left with a soup of mushy ideas. To put it another way, this book does not hold up well as a whole.   Another thing is the plot. Frey starts the story off with a brutal murder in young Conner Ashby's apartment. Conner is pulling down a couple of hundred G's a year so this is probably a posh place were talking about. He is having a daliance with a lady, leaves to hit up the local supermarket, spends a few minutes there, comes back, and she is dead. Conner had recieved an email a few moments before he left and it comes to his attention that the murder was done so that the evidence of the email could be covered up. OK, I can live with that. But the way Frey unfolds it all is so goofy that it pretty much destroys the rest of the book. Some CEO character sends out an email to Conner and with in 20 minutes he hires a hit man, sends him to Conners place, tears it apart, kills a girl, and then confronts our protagonist. Conner then chases the bad guy around NY for an hour, comes back to his place with some cops, and everything that was destroyed is put back into place without a sign of anything wrong happening. Whats up with that?  I am not giving away anything here. This occurs in the first few pages and sets up the rest of the book. Conner just had the lady he loves murdered in his place and then over the next few chapters he misses time from his insanely competitive job to have flirtatious hours long conversations and seems to have not been affected at all by the terrifying events. Repetedly in this book he is attacked and then a few pages later he is suave and making moves with young ladies.   This book is slow. This book goes into chapter long discources on the corruptability of fortune 500 companies. This book has long episodes of buildup that leads nowhere, not even as a diversionary plot thread.  All in all this is a trainwreck of a novel and I suggest that you leave it alone. I would point you towards 'Mystic River' by Lehane or 'Tell No One' by Coben for novels in this style that actually work 
 Do you remember the 70s when the sight of two lovely ladies trying on clothing would be arousing? This movie is a good example of those erotic, but not explicit, movies. Both women are natural beauties, especially Rebecca Brooke. An effort was made to shoot visually interesting outdoor and interior scenes. The plot is simple. The only reason I gave it a low score is that the video transfer looks like a third generation VHS copy. I don't expect a Criterion-level restoration but for the price, it should be much better than it is 
 Well, I ordered the book on Jan 18th (a month ago) and it still hasn't shipped. The email asking me to write a review reminded me that I even ordered it in the first place. So, maybe this vendor is awesome at other things, but not very reliable when it comes to e-commerce.  Yeah, that's it 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
 Making History is about a Cambridge student, Michael, and a physics professor who, by transporting sterility drugs through time to a well in Austria, create a world were Hitler had never been born. Making History is conceptually interesting, but poorly executed and at times exceedingly dull. Many of the action sequences are written in a screenplay format, which leaves some of the book's major scenes without any narrative description and results in tedious chapters where characters act without discernable motivation. The slower paced, more interesting first person narrative style is abandoned (it seems) in favor of getting quickly through scenes that, though vital to the plot, do not afford the oppurtunity for clever banter or amusing description that the author is so fond of. The resolution is forced and unsatisfying, and there are glaring holes in the plot that are never resolved. Fry is a witty writer, but I think he is overreaching with this book.    
 I've seen the reviews on both sides and after reading the book it looks like critics outweigh fans on getting to the heart of the matter.  Nothing personal against the author, but his track record shows a predisposition to Charles Hartshorne's views on philosophy and theology when approaching the Bible. Where does this stuff come from? Liberal Yale & Princeton. That's what conservative evangelical pastors are missing at more traditional educational institutions. It's not so much a matter of whether seminarians are cocooned. It depends on what sort of caterpillaring goes into the chrysalis to begin with and what's added to the mix.   Remember, please, the old professor's warning: PICO - Preconclusions In, Conclusions Out. When this author decided to add Hartshorne and Process material in his cocooning, his doctrinal DNA got deviated away from the Bible in many key areas apparently undetectable to himself and many fans.  One friendly reviewer advises us to read this stuff without too many preconceptions. That's silly. All of us have preconceptions, or Control Beliefs that lens or filter how we do Bible and interpret Christian principles to life and beliefs. Those with hyperArminian bent can't help but nod heads at what this book theorizes about God and his Biblical attributes. Others with more Calvinist bent can't help but wag heads at the very idea that God is unaware of free futures and thus unable to prevent gratuitious moral evil among free beings.  Perhaps if Bible students were less Arminian or Calvinist but more wholistically Scriptural they would see a 'Calminian' viewpoint that maintains Biblical integrity and doesn't compromise God's Exhaustive Omniprescience and Omnipresence the way this author can't help but doing based on his doctrinal training and educational preconditioning.  Friendly challenge to ultra-arminian fans of Open Theism: check out Hartshorne's influence on this author via his first book: Trinity & Process (his doctoral dissertation), seeing how deeply indoctrinated by Hartshornian principles that skew interpretation of Scripture. Also to get a more balanced view, see M. Erickson's 'What Does God Know' and D.A.Carson's essay in 'God Under Fire'. Of course, just knowing your Bible helps a lot when it comes to God's predictive ability to infinitestimal detail in Elijah's, Elisha's and Jeremiah's unconditional free-future prophecies. Open Theism doesn't quite fit the Biblical witness and must be repudiated. Thanks for your attention. 
 I decided that I had to write a review about Newsweek this morning, after I came across yet another biased, over-hyped cover story. This particular one is entitled, "Rethinking the Marriage Crunch," and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman's chances of getting married later in life. This was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around, and neglected to have any on this occasion. I really think another reviewer's comparison to People is quite apt, but Newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue. Two years ago, we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning "Infidelity Chic." Yes, it seems, according to their sources, spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue, without even a hint of contradiction, that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before. I find the magazine to be [...] as they offer opinion instead of news; theirs is a mission of persuasion. Overall, there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool. 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 For years I have avoided Jodi Picoult novels and if this one is typical, with good reason.  For my book club, I am plowing through the nauseating minuate that bulks this novel to over 400 pages.  The constant, brief shifts in first-person narration are too fast and give views on characters, such as a judge who likes show tunes, that are irrelevant to the novel at the expense of more fully developing the title character.  The first-person narration works for important characters but otherwise I think the author is using an easy narrative device to propel the action of her novel, which is, even with this technique, infuriatingly slow and has the effect of jarring the reader every page or two as one must determine the narrator yet again.    Also, the focus on the child-custody battle removes attention from who I think is the most interesting character--the child Faith.  If one can get past the didactic symbolism of the name Faith White, and the constant phrasing such as "here is a story about faith" (p. 275) followed by "he'll do whatever is in his power to make sure I keep Faith," (p.291), which makes me cringe at each repetition, the child seeing or hearing God is, to me, the most interesting aspect of the plot but one that receives little attention.    Overall, I think this novel is heavy-handed, overly descriptive and replete with such obvious symbolism and detail it makes my eyes hurt. The characters never seem real and I never sympathize with any of their easily predictable reactions and emotions, but find the potential of the plot is never fully realized in any engaging way. Try a different novel- many others dealing with religion exist that are far better written and much more interesting 
 The chapters are not of consistent strength or substance.  And then too, I came across a number of instances where statements were made without any attempt to support them with specific examples.  I cannot offer specifics instances of the aforementioned because I have already discarted the book.  This was required reading for a college course 
 This is supposed to be a concise book, but it sadly does not tackle the most practical aspects that are needed for front-liners. Example: when talk on amputee, prefers to talk on amputee gait instead of practical things like how to improve stump, how to deal with troubles with doning or doffing Example: when talk about SCI, not even mention let alone discuss very important topics like bowel problems & sexual problems these young patients have Example: when talk about pain, not even touch upon the topic of centralization, let alone discussing how to treat. The discussion on CRPS not up-to-date  Poor Buy, good alone for junior medical student 
 I wonder if the same thing happens to me, but it seems people always get hypnotized into thinking some actually crappy groups is really good.  I think certain types of brains are more susceptible to the powers of the subliminal hypnosis, and others are not.  You see, when we read the reviews on here we don't know who is under the band's magical spell and who isn't, so we end up buying an album based on the rage reviews that some people who normally have great taste in music. We then order the album, listen to it, start wondering, "nah, this must be an acquire album, like espresso or something."   After the 5th listen it just starts pissing you off more, because you've been wasting your time and money searching for something that isn't there.  Finally, you realize that the positive reviewers are not deaf, dumb, or part of the band's extended family, but they are just under the magical hypnosis of some cut rate band.  All joking aside, this album pretty much sucks for reasons I don't even want to get into.  There are moments when you think they may have stumbled on to something, but then it quickly vanishes into some repetitious electronic nonsense.  Some people have it, some don't.  Notwist does not.  The comparisons to Radiohead are offensive and sacrilegious, but you are forgiven because you know not what you write, you poor spellbound listener 
 The stitching on the front of shirt is defective so the shirt folds and stretched out... 
 I was so eager to read this book. But I was so disappointed when I finally did read it. I couuldnt even make it to the end of it. its so boring. and she keeps jumping from a story to another without knowing what is the real point of telling that story. its like you'are sitting with some talkative chatterbox who keeps on talking and talking till you lose it..  
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 I was extremely disappointed in this book.  The characters are one-dimensional, the plot juvenile, and the language irritating.  I quickly got tired of words such as "Otherworldly" and "thigh-freedom".  The treatment of Christian characters is also a bit disturbing 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 A customer asked me to give him a brief overview of nanotechnology. This book was not helpful. Full of hype, jargon and precious little technical information, the main focus seemed to be to convince the reader to run out and invest in nanotechnology or be hopelessly left behind. I paid $12.89 for the book on Amazon, read about half of it and took it to the used bookstore in my neighborhood. They offered me $2.00 for it and I grabbed the money, though I felt guilty for taking advantage of them 
 I couldn't finish it. I was shocked to find how sad this book was compared to her other books. I mean all the books deal with the Walsh sisters going through a tough time in their life and dealing with difficult times but this was TOO MUCH!!! Seems Keys's dark side came out writing this book. The Walsh family is funny and I like reading about the dynamics within the family but this book was just too dark and dreary. 
 More Left Wing Liberal News media hate fest rhetoric based on rearrangement of the facts to suit the conclusion. Yes Bush led the country to war and yes Iraq is troublesome and problematic on many levels. But we are in fact at war with a determined enemy out to destroy our culture and make us all worship and worse yet act a certain way. And even worse yet writers like Mr. Rich are helping that come true. I definitley did agree with the authors conclusions and accusations. 
 In this book Mr Sen makes many outright factual errors and acts as an apologist for Islamofascism. Mr Sen makes an idiotic arguement ad nauseum. He says people have different personalities and easily concludes that differnt personalities will not lead to conflicts Also he believes that by filling the entire book with the same idea he has hoodwinked the readers to his logical fallacy. That people have differnt aspects to personality is true, but misleading. It is true that people in pluralistic societies like India or USA people are allowed or even encouraged ( by proponents of diversity in USA) to have multiple ideologies. But people in Muslim societies can either be Muslims or kafirs. Thus a clash is inevitable.  The book is a dimwitted attempt to counter Samuel Huntington. While Huntington has propounded his theories on solid research, Mr Sen has merely used selective examples from history to put prove his illogical ideas. Even Faoud Ajami in his review has identified these errors. Also the book seems a rehash of his previous book '' Argumentative Indian'' which was equally foolish. If you have wasted money on that book, you would be very foolish to buy this one.   Mr Sen doesn't cover the most crucual aspects of civilizational conflict that a reader might be interested in having answers to. Mr Sen keeps on repeating the same stale examples. He doesnt go into the genesis of conflicts. His specious arguements can fool only the remarkably stupid.  Also he ignores the wisdom that "there is no point in sheep passing resolution in favor of vegetarianism if wolves remain of opposite views." Thus the Indians and Westerners who believe in democracy and pluralism are the sheep and Islamists are the wolves. Even Hitler could have ranted about multiple identities- he a Nazi, a German, a male, a person of Catholic  ancestry but favoring Protestantism, an asexual person who hated homosexuals, a meat eater who became vegetarian, a person who had depression but put lunatics to death, a lover of arts but a savage and so on. Wow life and civilization is so simple in Mr Sen's dream world existence of multiple identities assure peace!  Also in his book he makes a misleading arguement that Bangladesh has 10% hindus - the same percentage as Muslims in India. Prima facie that makes Bangladesh look like a paradise of tolerance. The truth is that Bangladesh should be compared with  West Bengal. In Bangladesh the Hindus were 30% in 1947, became 20% in 1971 and now are just 10%. In West bengal Muslims have risen from 12% to 27% in last 60 years. In India overall they have risen from 10% to 13% and in Pakistan Hindus have dwindled from 10% to 2%. My stats are supported by the numerous ''secular'' and ''progressive'' sources.This is just how Mr Sen has committed intellectual fraud in his book. By taking data out of context and in many places, as Adami points out, making blatantly false statements.  I really like Sen as an economist. his views on democracy and their relation to famines is clearly very incisive and seminal. But Mr Sen should stop being a political scientist. He is a miserable failure and only lowering his image in front of people (like me) who adore his economics.I am giving this book one star coz I cannot give it a zero. The fundamnetal premise of the book is faulty, the examples provided erroneous, the theories put forth specious and the conclusions drawn absolutely bogus 
 The definitive book about Bill is "No One Left To Lie To", by Christopher Hitchens.  He knows how to take a scapel and wield it to reveal the core of a maggot. This book is way too soft 
 18 Jun 2005  As the book progressed, it got more and more egoistic, to the point where it becomes a turn-off towards the end of the book. I am surprised that there was so little mentioned of Hakeem. Shaq's attitude seems to be that since he can score, he does not respect centers who can't score. Whereas he respect Bill Russell. But he does give Kobe his fair share of spotlight. The other book I read was an unabashed hype of Shaq, so this is a big improvement. 
 This is the poorest collection of "punk" songs I have ever seen put together, if you are looking for a real punk compilation rather than the trash you hear on the radio AND the trash produced by labels such as Epitaph who are just as much in it for the money then buy something like "100% Hardcore Punk" (goto www.interpunk.com). Only settle for buying a compilation if it is the last thing you do! Most of the songs on the punk-o-rama series are not even remotely punk anyway; a lot of what is put onto the compilations is emo just to sell the record to a wider audience. Sod that for a laugh, emo is not punk; emo goes against almost everything punk is for. Musically, I'm sure it's great (!) but as the majority of people reviewing this album are saying "buy it because it's so much more punk than anything you've bought before" I will review on this basis aswell. Buy some A Global Threat, Aus-Rotten, Unseen or Crass and get into some real punk rock rather than this garbage produce for MTV2 
 Anyone ever see any of these rap "artists" perform live? They're the most boring, derivative "entertainers" in the world. They walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and YELL their lyrics. They go from talking on records to yelling on stage. Quite a stretch. All this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying "YEAH!" "UH-HUH!" "WHAT!" "THAT'S RIGHT!" "UH!" etc. Get real.  Meanwhile, the only "music" provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage. It makes for the most dull, predictable "concert" you'll ever see.   I can't wait until all this nonsense just disappears. In a world of common sense, these idiots would still be flipping burgers at McDonald's.  
 I found some gems in this book but I don't recommend it. The authors should learn to write in English and the Publisher should learn the art of copy editing. Otherwise, this book could have worked.  Whoever wrote Chapter 15 did a good job and wrote the best material in the book. But, he/she still didn't give the reader an clear understanding of SASL.   The authors attempted to tie everything together in Chapter 19 - A Company Mail Server. But, you literally cannot get it to work. I doubt anyone ever tested it. The LDAP setup is out of sequence and obliterates the directory. If you try to make this work - and I image people would buy this book for that reason alone - you might just wind up shaking your head in defeat.   In summary, I see some lousy writing, a serious lack of editing and a book with incorrect information. It's difficult to recommend 
 well i think the stuff needs to be tested better i got the bell pump and it was broke and i don't have the money to send it back so im stuck with it im realy not happy about this bell pum 
 I thought this book was terribly dull and uninteresting.  I had to read this for a college course and was deeply disappointed in the material and the story line.  I had to literally force myself to stay awake and read another sentence.  Yes, it was that bad.  I do not reccomend this book to anyone.  In fact I have warned avid reads, like myself, to never pick the book up. I am a reader who likes thick plots, action, mystery, everything but what this book had to offer.    I do not think I learned anything that opened my mind to another culture or about life in general.  The book jumped around a lot between present and past and it was easy to get confused and disinterested.  Not to be too harsh but: horrible, horrible, horrible!  Save yourself the time, money, and effort.  Read another book 
 The title of the book would leave one to believe that it examines and demonstrates the position that compassion and empathy go hand in hand with intelligence. This point was perhaps mentioned once in passing (without support) while the rest of the book tried to describe the evolution of the brain and how certain traumas will inhibit its growth. The title also states that it is a guide to further develop the brain. However, most of the book contains no useful information except for the point that the brain can be further developed by doing new and different activities. This is about the extent of the 'guide'. I was quite disappointed overall and certainly didn't read anything revolutionary or even new 
 The pictures and concept are very enticing, but stick to Lego and Playmobil for durability.  The Imaginext set we purchased was hard for a 6yr old to assemble.  The pieces don't stay together easily, so right now it is in pieces all over the floor.  Not much fun for the 6-yr old in the long run and not fun for Mom! 
 The length of the jacket could be a little longer...bairly hits the belt 
 They say all the major characters come back in `Stitch the Movie,' quickly made direct-to-video sequel to the hugely popular `Lilo and Stitch.' For me, the original film's most appealing part is, and will be, Lilo and Stitch, one of the most delightful characters Disney created in the last decade. Do we still need Pleakley when we have Stitch? How about Cobra? Or some alien whose name you have forgotten? Do we need them? No, I don't think so.  But `Stitch the Movie' crammed all these characters into this small film of which running time barely exceeds one hour, together with a weak story that repeats exactly what the original was doing. The original's idea of `Ohana' or `family' is changed to `cousin' this time, but for most of the viewers this is literally a twice-told story, no longer attractive enough.  What makes us feel short-changed is, however, the lack of music and scenery, the impressive parts of `Lilo and Stitch.' Instead of Elvis songs, they have thrown in parodies or homage to other films and TVs like Monty Python and Ed Wood, completely missing the target audiences who would buy this DVD to experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer.   Moreover, the charming, water-color Hawaiian scenery is reduced to the generic, unimaginative backdrop which is barely OK even by the lower standard of the Disney's cheap sequels.  The only saving grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to the characters. Except that, and the funny but brief scenes about the lovely pair Lilo and Stitch, `Stitch the Movie' looks like a pilot film for the original. Or perhaps it is. 
 I ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest.  Tipler's theory of immortality, in a nutshell, is the following: 1) the planet earth...and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in ~1 billion years. 2) Man will make self-learning and self-replicating machines (can Windows XP do that?) that will colonize, over millions of years, our galaxay and, eventually, the entire universe. 3) These machines will be capable of individual thoughts, emotions, etc and are essentially "alive." 4) As the universe begins to collapse, the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe. 5) All the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one "super being" at the center of the collapsing universe...this super being is the "omega point." 6) The omega point, via its "all knowledge of all things" will be able make emulations (exact duplicates) of all biospheres, including earth.  Within these emulations, individual humans (you and me!) will be emulated.  Thus we will again be "alive" as these "beings" in these emulations will be unable to tell if they're real or virtual....PRESTO...immortality for all.  The book (theory) reeks of circular logic and assumptions.  It's an interesting theory, but it's just that, an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist.  PS: Tipler denies the resurection of Christ and in  the last chapter admits to being an aetheist.  (I wonder if he's a God-fearing aetheist? 
 Listen y'all, I dont know about you, but I HAVE NO INTENTION WHATSOEVER of LISTENING TO  OR SUPPORTING A REGGAE BAND THAT SELLS    THIER    MUSIC (or should  i say, muzak?)   TO    THE  CCOOOPPPSSS F - ING TV show. the hell with this band, I love reggae, i realize that cops are an important part of pur society/ culture (they keep the peace), BUT REGGAE AND COPS? Take a very long walk off of a short pier boys. Inner Circle are sell outs! I feel that you, the curious and not so knowledgable reggae purveyor, should disregard all of these five star reviews of this band, because they are written by folks that have no interest in true reggae, and have no clue what it is about! Call me a reggae snob if you will, but I truely think that if you want to check out reggae you should close this page and do a google search on " LISTMANIA, crucial reggae". Do the work and start at a more real place. In years to come you will be glad 
 This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased! What a waste of money! I thought this would be like a VH1 "Behind The Music", but instead this DVD looks like amateurs threw it together and put it up for sale -- I could have made a better DVD of Britney on my computer! Unless you want to waste your time and money, do yourself a favor, and don't buy this piece of crap 
 Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now."  And what did I find as a result of my maverick literary exploration?  Ehh...  Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful.  If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere 
 I'd have to say this is pretty tedious stuff. I searched and searched in vain for some spark of greatness, but it simply isn't there. Many of the comments from other reviewers about the twists and turns of the plot, and the depth of Eco's knowledge are probably accurate. However these alone do not make great writing.   If I am honest I'd have to say that this is fairly badly written. It is barely coherent in places and, at the end, I am not entirely sure what the point of the novel was. Unless the point was to peer inside the mindset of a provincial Italian from a few centuries ago. However is that kind of subject matter worth an entire novel?  As noted much of the fanfare seems to surround Eco's evident knowledge base, but this has not been put to good use in this attempt. The character seems very cartoonish at times, and the style of writing (jumping from past to present amongst other things) is clunky.  If this were not attached to a great name I reckon we'd see many more negative comments and, indeed, it is so bad I doubt it would have been considered worthy of publishing 
 The "Bottomless Well" seemed to be an intriguing approach to tackling the problem of our potential to run out of "energy" by simply negating that it's a problem.  I went for it, and wish I could get my time and money back.  There are all sorts of graphs and charts that at first glance appear as if this book is a well-researched, believable source of information.  It explains that that we can extract low-grade energy from the earth (ie coal and oil), refine it, and put it into a highly-ordered form where we can use it in our cars, computers, and (their favorite example)...laser beams.  Of course, it takes energy to extract and refine energy, so the subtitle of their book is counter-intuitive at first glance.  In fact, I feel that they did a very poor job of expaining why we will never run out of energy.  In actuality, I could argue that they did a good job of explaining exactly the opposite, especially if you consider one of the most important elements that was conveniently missing from their analysis and graphs, and only mentioned in passing.  That factor is increasing demand due to human population growth.    If you look at the charts in the book that deal with increased energy demand, increased efficiencies, increased order, etc. and factor in population growth, much of their point is completely negated.  The population of humanity on the planet continues to grow, and with it, grows demand for food, oxygen, electricity, and many other necessities and pleasures.  Even if we grow food more efficiently and transmit electricity more efficiently, the fact is that the demand will continue to grow as the population increases, and there are some limiting factors that just shouldn't be ignored.  However, they are in this book.  If you want to be blind to that, go ahead and read it.  I'm off to read something that might be more realistic....maybe even find out how I can help further sustainability instead of close my eyes like the Bush administration did regarding global warming and hope the problem goes away.  
 The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.  Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package."  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.  This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.     One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.  In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me 
 Okay, I got it! Michelle was a bad lady, full of deceitful and murderous thoughts. She's the kind of lady we all love to hate. Good true crime story. But, reading this book is a lot like spending all day with my aunt Helen in Queens. I kept waiting for the author to write something creative to help move the story along, but it never happened. Bore, bore, bore! I just finished reading a similar story about another lady who conspired to murder her husband with her boyfriend (Dale Hudson's Dance of Death) and it was like riding a roller coaster. I couldn't put Hudson's book down. But with Fleeman's book, I couldn't wait to put it down. I assure you I won't be telling my friends about this book. Hey, I'm a generous guy, but two stars is all you'll get from me on this one.      
 A half Wizard, half demon incubus resides in a district called the Den of Iniquity and stalks humans.  He is bored, jaded, drinks coffee.  Pretty interesting, huh?  Then he changes somehow, becoming shy, gauche, and hesitant after encountering a child described "the rabbit".  They are soul mates. They are also bland beyond description.  There is also some sort of predictable battle between good and evil.  The Den of Iniquity, which could have been that memorable exotic "dark carnival" with a little exposition, but turns out to be filled with kindly folk, no more naughty than a weekend in Las Vegas.  Although the concept of a fractured world with irregular connections is very original, development was lacking.  It is unclear how Landscapers (always female) work---they plant small gardens to serve as anchor points to connect non-contiguous areas.  Bridges (always male) can somehow make the connections. Their work and training is left to the reader's imagination, but apparently sincerity and heart's desire and focused wishing has a lot to do with it.  Too much of the book describes unpredictable travel from one section to another.  Many words are written about Light and Dark in a kind of emotional shorthand, as if these concepts were mutually exclusive. Light is prettier and sincere.  Dark is undefined. The dark arch villain is reminiscent of Chthulu.  Anne Bishop has done better. I confess that I plowed through 400+ pages of repetitious verbiage waiting for something dramatic to happen.  Nothing sparkled, nothing resonated. Sigh. 
 The truck gets clogged up often, it is extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always require an adult to load.  The tower is decent, albeit, it doesn't quite work as advertised as well.  Our kids wound up just knocking down the dominos the old fashioned way.  I grew up in the "Domino Rally" days and compared to the original toys, these don't stack up.    The truck and tower just aren't worth it, you are better off buying a bag of dominoes and letting your kids make their own domino trails 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 From the start, Trotsky always thought that revolution in any one country could only succeed if it received the active support of revolutions in other countries. But similarly, these other revolutions would also need to receive help from others: the Russian revolution could not survive without a revolution in Germany, but neither could a German revolution survive without a Russian. This mutual dependence meant that no country could ever start a revolution: it would have to wait on the success of another.  So to provoke these indispensable other revolutions, Trotsky was quite prepared to invade other countries. For example, in 1919 he wrote, "A cavalry corps of 30-40,000 horsemen must be formed to invade India." Similarly, at Brest-Litovsk in February 1918, Trotsky made the Soviet revolution's very survival depend on the putative German revolution, risking total defeat by the German army on the throw of a revolution in Germany. He said, "We declare we end the war but do not sign a peace. They will be unable to make an offensive against us. If they attack us, our position will be no worse than now ..." This phrase-mongering did not frighten the German generals, who saw only that Trotsky was refusing to sign the offered peace. They then attacked, as he said they could not do, and seized millions of square miles of Soviet territory, making the Soviet position far worse than before. In the 1930s, the Opposition leagued with Hitler. Churchill wrote, "The German government was in touch with important Russian personalities through the Soviet embassy in Prague. The plot aimed at overthrowing Stalin and introducing into Russia a new pro-German regime. Soviet Russia carried out a merciless but doubtless useful purge of political and economic circles. The Soviet army was purged of pro-German elements." Goebels admitted, "Stalin got rid of all the opposition circles in the Red Army and thus succeeded in making sure there were no more defeatist groups in the Army." The Opposition fought against the programmes of industrialisation and collectivisation that made possible all the Soviet Union's heroic achievements. For instance, in April 1930, Trotsky's Bulletin of the Opposition said, "Put a stop to `mass collectivisation'. ... Put a stop to the hurdle race of industrialisation. ... Abandon the `ideals' of self-contained economy. Draw up a new variant of a plan providing for the widest possible intercourse with the world market." In 1938, Trotsky called for the collective farms to be closed down, and for Soviet enterprises to be handed over to foreign powers.  He consistently called on the Soviet people to overthrow the Soviet government when Hitler attacked. He called for a `revolutionary uprising', an `insurrection' against the Soviet government, when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union. He wrote, "the impetus to the Soviet workers' revolutionary upsurge will probably be given by events outside the country." "The first social shock, external or internal, may throw the atomized Soviet Society into civil war." He asked, "Can we expect that the Soviet Union will come out of the coming great war without defeat? To this frankly posed question, we will answer as frankly: If the war should remain only a war, the defeat of the Soviet Union would be inevitable. In a technical, economic and military sense, imperialism is incomparably more strong. If it is not paralysed by revolution in the West, imperialism will sweep away the present regime." "The defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable in case the new war shall not provoke a new revolution. ... If we theoretically admit war without revolution, then the defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable." He wrote, "It would be childish to think that the Stalin bureaucracy can be removed by means of a Party or Soviet Congress. Normal, constitutional means are no longer available for the removal of the ruling clique. ... They can be compelled to hand over power to the Proletarian vanguard only by FORCE." "Inside the Party, Stalin has put himself above all criticism and the State. It is impossible to displace him except by assassination. Every oppositionist becomes ipso facto a terrorist." Trotsky lied to the `Dewey Commission' when he told them that that he had not been organising an underground in the Soviet Union. The leader of Trotsky's Fourth International, Ernest Mandel, openly applauded Boris Yeltsin, the key figure in the counter-revolution that finally restored capitalism in the Soviet Union. He wrote, "The reformer Yeltsin represents the tendency which wants to reduce the gigantic state apparatus. Consequently he follows in Trotsky's footsteps." The Socialist Workers Party backed the US-organised and funded terrorists, which spawned bin Laden, against the people of Afghanistan. "Mujehadin victory will encourage the opponents of Russian rule everywhere in the USSR and Eastern Europe." 
 The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the "Just say no" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack 
 For all the endorsements, you think there'd be more material than "here are some good ideas on how to listen and communicate with others".  I was disappointed with this book.  The author spends a lot of time trying to classify people into 3 different categories, and then trys to define how you can communicate with each category.  He provides no DATA on to support this categorization, just "hey this seems like a good idea&quot 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 Unless you know absolutely nothing about the US, the world, and/or English grammar, don't even think of buying this book. The book has not been updated for new test format, and has quite a few ?printing/editing? mistakes. Just use the study guide from FSOE website & any English grammar book to prepare 
 I bought this as a large print book for my mother-in-law who has trouble with her vision.  This is NOT large print  She did enjoy the stor

 An Autobiography of Jack Gantos told under the name of Joey Pigza. While Jack Gantos sits in his jail cell he tells you the story of how he got there. Young Jack wants to be a writer, but growing up in a poor family means that he doesn't have the money to go to school. So he goes to live with his grandparents in the Virgin Islands. Shortly discovering how much Jack drinks, they kick him out. 	From there, he goes to live with a family who have an extra room and he messes that up too when he gets sick all over their house. After going through that and a ghetto hotel, he goes home to St Croix to live with his parents and work with his dad. He makes minimum wage by making and shipping crates. When a gut named Hamilton comes in with blueprints for a special crate for smuggling hash he offers jack a job. Jack sees the opportunity to get rich quick and use it to go to college, he had no second thoughts. He ends up in a medium security prison for smuggling drugs to the US. 	I really enjoyed this book because I, myself have done wrong things to do good things. I've also thought about doing things to get money quick. It's easy to make bad decisions when things are hard in life. this is an awsome book for teenagers to read and i think everybody should read this 
 I have never found a Jet Li movie I haven't truly enjoyed until this one.  Like a lot of his movies, there are a lot of martial art sequences and some are terrific.  But later on the lion dance competion is hectic.  There are lion costumers everywhere and it's hard to tell what is going on.  However, it is probably something you won't see in another movie so if you want to see a different kind of martial arts competition, try this but it may not be for everyone 
 I returned it even though i had to pay to ship it back! Should not be a kids book, it had very few pictures and no color 
 This "handbook" presents an extremely simple and narrow look at Chinese horoscopes. It might be lots of fun at parties, but don't expect to get a detailed horoscope from it.  Anyone really familiar with Western horoscopes will know "Heaven Knows What" by Grant Lewi. I use that as my point of comparison for any book on astrology. Lewi's work has a flaw in that it fails to deliver any technique that can be used outside of his system and doesn't illustrate much of the mechanics of astrological study, yet with his book newcomers are able to produce very detailed horoscopes that compare well to the most advanced techniques of aficionados.  How does Lau's work compare to Lewi's book? Not well at all. As with Lewi, Lau's work falls short on technique, but her book also doesn't produce results. Lau's work is simple and disgustingly "correct." It is never at all challenging, negative or critical. Where Lewi's work demonstrates artistry and deep compelling knowledge with clear, detailed and personal descriptions, Lau offers no more than bland pleasant entertainment.  You might think that a book of 400+ pages would have to have quite a bit of useful content, but you'd be wrong. Most of the book is filled with the same descriptions repeated over and over again with slight variation for each sign. It's as much a substantive handbook as a CPR poster is a physician's desk reference.  You can learn very little from this book. You can learn the birth years for each sign and some general characteristics and compatibility between the signs. All of that information is available for free on Chinese restaurant placemats. This book will not teach you anything about the mechanics of Chinese astrology, nor will you learn anything deep or insightful about anyone with it.  Even though it's very simple, I don't think that this is a very good book for a beginner who wants to progress with Chinese astrology. It's an incredibly superficial glimpse of a complex and beautiful philosophy that will leave a real seeker disquieted and unfulfilled.  One more valuable bit of information: The charts in this book do not extend very far into the future. If you rely on it to any extent, you'll have to pick up another copy every few years. Other books offer decades of charts. This is pure shameless exploitation 
 "Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.    The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.  The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.    With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more. 
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it 
 I would give this toy a 0 if it was an option.  When you unfold the tiny track and get the train going, it can't even make one corner turn without coming off the track!  The train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track.  This is very frustrating for my kids and I cannot believe they even put this on the market?  You can't even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it.  I am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is.  We wanted this toy for portability.  Our kids also have the GeoTrax Working Railway, which is awesome, but not as portable 
 Reading this book was about as pleasant as a throwing knife to the face.  I am going to be a senior in high school next year, and I just finished this book for my summer assignments for AP Literature.  I literally took a victory lap around my house upon completion.  I HATED this book.  It was boring and rather pointless.  No one cares about the romantic struggles of a fake character.  This is basically the chick flick of books.  I honestly believe this is the worst book I've ever read.  I encourage everyone with a Y chromosome to stay as far away from this book as possible.  By the way, this is Rebecca's son, which explains my disgust for this book 
 Feeling sick already just by looking at this! Not a very funny joke! Don't believer in fung-shuei, but this is just not a good luck symbol for any place 
 I'll repeat what an August 5th reviewer stated : If you've already bought the book How To Talk To Anyone - 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships by the same author then don't buy this book as it is the same. I bought both of them together and was really annoyed when I discovered they were the same. How can someone re-write a book under a different title without any mention of this fact on the book cover ?  You'll also note that Editorial review of both books is the same and have the same quotes from Larry King and McKay. Shame on Amazon for not giving me a full refund 
 They very happily sold me a DVD that would not work in our "region." I see that I am not the first to be cheated either. They would not even consider trading the item for one that would work in the U.S. What jerks. I will never buy from them again 
 My question for Mr. Chiniquy would be, were he alive, "Why did you stay 50 years in the Church of Rome if it was such a pit of depravity and a morass of evil?"  I MEAN, FIFTY YEARS?  It's hard enough reading the book--LIVING it for 50 years would seem to be mindbogglingly soul-searing.  C'mon--either he was a liar and this never happened or he was complicit in the wrongdoing.  Like that old Chinease proverb says, 'To ignore evil is to become part of it.' 
 The first two or three tracks are good but the supporting instrumentals and vocals are poor.  The supporting instrumental on track 6 was so bad I thought the cd had a defect.  In other places, the supporting music is  barely audible.  The only singing occurs on track 12.  I would recommend  getting the cd "Picture This".  It's much better 
 While the concept for this album is excellent - Meatloaf and Bonnie Tyler doing Steinman - who could ask for more -- the content leaves the listener feeling cheated.  The recordings are all shortened [probably radio]  versions. The sound is hollow - what, don't they have decent recording  studios in Holland?  If you are a fan of the original recordings - burn  your own CD or make your own tape from all the different albums -- you'll  definitely come out ahead. I felt cheated and disappointed.  If a negative  star rating was available I would have used that 
 If one knows little of physics, of the "quantum" flavor or otherwise, reading this book is no way to start addressing such a deficiency.  Why?  Because neither does Wilson.  (The same should be said about his knowledge of psychology.)    Those who rate this book highly I can only suppose are they who have not studied enough to recognize immediately how little Wilson has to say that is either new, correct, and/or not misguided.  I finished the book for no other reason than that (a) I figured it had to get better (It didn't.), and (b) I was traveling and got bored (a condition not addressed in any way by this book).    That Wilson uses his book to demonstrate, with truly sickening repetition, his outright contempt for Catholics and unveiled hatred of conservatives (No doubt there are others on his list of those to be hated.) tells us everything that tolerant and open-minded people need to know about the author.  Even if Wilson had the academic creditials reasonably needed to write a book such as this (He doesn't.), his bigotry alone would make clear that one should expect to find no real "science" in this rambling book.  And there ain't any 
 I decided to rent this movie after having seen Farenheit 9-11 and compare the two. Comparing it to Farenheit 9-11 this movie is amazingly bad. Farenheit brought out things that were done by Congress that this movie just glossed over. Farenheit actually interviewed congress members who admitted that they had not read the act before voting on it. This filn stated that they had all carefully read it in a very quickly glossed over statement. They did not address the Bush-Bin Laden connection or the fact that the Bush administration very quickly got the Bin Laden family out of the country after 9-11.  This movie is just a rehash of the Bush campaign's attack on John Kerry and really not worth the time it takes to watch it. And it's only a little bit over an hour long!!! Doesn't present any documentation of the "facts" that it proposes. At least Michael Moore backs up his charges with either documentation or direct interviews with the subjects. Also, much of what is proposed in this film has now been proven false.  Don't waste your money or time with this film 
 Most Americans know a little about China, especially the history during Culture Revolution, and most distinguished Chinese writers can't write in English, therefore, Anchee has chance to get well known in the US. However, her novel is quite superficial both in English and Chinese. If it is translated into Chinese, I am afraid very few people would buy it since the story is boring. Additionally, she claimed to be trained in a studio organized by Jiang, Ching, Madam Mao. I doubt the truthfulness about something claimed by her in the story. There is no official materials to support it. I bet American will understand China better if many excellent Chinese novels can be translated in English. One example is Chinese resturants in the US. Generally, they can not be claimed as original Chinese foods, they are just adapted to the taste of some Americans, which explains why most Chinese do not like most of so called Chinese resturants in the US. If Americans have been to China, they will definitely like foods there better.   I met Anchee a couple of times previously when she sold her books.  
 I bought this expecting to get 101 generic rock licks that I could use while improvising, but that's not what this book is.  It's just a variety of very recignizeable bits and pieces of various songs, some rhythm parts, some solo parts.  I would only recommend this if you're interested in learning three or four bars of a Nirvana song, two or three bars of a Pink Floyd song, etc.  Like, "Impress your friends by knowing the first two bars of Lithium by Nirvana".  You may as well just buy the songbooks for your favorite albums and get the whole songs - it's not like there's any analysis of anything in here.  I can't see any purpose in this book existing except maybe if you're thinking of buying a Fender Cyber-Twin amp, this is a great demonstration of all the sounds that it can produce 
 When I bought the book I did not know that they already made a movie out of it but I learned about it later on. So I was really excited when I started to read it - also because other comments were really good. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all.  First the story development is really slow- it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens.  Second, several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly.  The worst part of the book though is its style: It does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime - he/she gets an extensive characterization. Most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader. Without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about 200 pages shorter.  But even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter, couldn't it still be an interesting book? Unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well. The detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than 100 pages. On top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is - and wonder why you need to go through over 200 pages to find out officially.  Conclusion: If you are a psychologist and/or like in-depth character studies this is exactly the right book for you. BUT for those of you who like fast-paced stories, ample twist and turns, surprises, action, thrilling developments and/or elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time. Please do not come anyway near it. Watch the movie instead - this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in 2 hours 
 Shut up you hapless hippie musical diseases!  Listen to better music than this...damn near every album released in the past two years sounds EXACTLY LIKE THIS 
 This is the book Dan Brown's bestseller "The Da Vinci Code" is based on. Indeed, Michael Baigent et.al. have even sued Brown in court, charging him with plagiarizing their book. The ideas behind "The Da Vinci Code" have been exposed as completely bogus by many real historians. Obviously, this exposure affects "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" as well.   This book is methodologically flawed. It claims that Jesus survived the crucifixion and sired children with Mary Magdalene. But if this happened, there should be ancient documents telling us about it. There are essentialy only three ancient views of Jesus: the Christian, the Judeo-Christian and the Gnostic. None of them includes the notion that Jesus married and had children with Mary Magdalene. It simply isn't serious to reject the ancient documents in favor of modern texts of questionable value, as Michael Baigent does. Of course, a conspiracy theorist might claim that the ancient documentation is lacking due to a massive cover-up. But such an argument, compelling as it may sound, is worthless to the historian, who must work with the real evidence, meager as it may be. A claim that can neither be proven or disproven is of little help. Besides, how many sects or cults have managed to keep their esoteric secrets? Very few indeed. There is always a defector or infiltrator somewhere. The idea that the biggest secret of all times was revealed by a confused French right-wing extremist only 40 years ago is very hard to take seriously. Indeed, the fact that not even heretical groups like the Gnostiscs claimed that Jesus had sired children, is good evidence against the claim. The Gnostics, after all, made all kinds of peculiar statements. But not this one. Why?   Why are books like "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" and "The Da Vinci Code" so popular? Perhaps they say what many people want to hear. That in itself is somewhat damning, I think. For how many people want to hear the truth?  
 Oh boy. I wish I didn't have to finish every book. It is just a pet peeve of mine. However, I couldn't get into this book. I see no clear theme. I know everyone was horrified at 9/11, however the theme went throughout the book and made the book even worse. What happens to all the characters? One is blown up in a maybe terrorist attack on Starbucks? Another one goes back to her husband. One runs into a tree while skiing and dies. Frankie wanders the city trying to hold onto her dad. Jeez, I was really hoping to like this book, but I just am relieved it is over 
 The story was the most silly and childish book that I ever read from this writer. Most dissapointed for a Danielle Steel novel. I had never had a book from Danielle Steel that I did not love but this one I don't know what else to say, bad, bad, bad 
 If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book 
 These new shows are mediocre at best. Nick made some quality shows 15-20 years ago. Put THESE on DVD and see what happens 
 This little book (Cantor's dilemma) came to my attention ironically not because of its well celebrated English version, but because of the new Chinese translation, which bore a new name (The prisoner of the Nobel Prize). Anyway, I spent a whole evening enthusiastically (at the beginning) perusing it (the English version), but was left with more or less joy. Many people in Amazon.com have praised this little book presumably without any reservation. I would also first congratulate the author's great effort to write a novel on scientific ethics, and in particular for the psychoanalysis of scientists. However, in terms of literature and science, I would say this book is not worth much attentions. The plot in this novel is too simple. A serious professor had a brilliant idea (which is flawed based on biology, by the way), two worked experiments (probably), and the Nobel prize, but suffered by unverified experiments due to suspicious manipulations of his postdoc. It surprised me that he won the prize within a year. This oversimplified the reality. If the professor didn't publish his experiment details and furthermore the experiments couldn't be replicated in other labs (officially), it is impossible to get the Nobel prize, let alone within a year. It would be better that the professor didn't get the Nobel prize and was constantly suffered from unverified experiments, rumors of data fabrication, and science politics. The deft handling of these crisis is more interesting for future academic seekers.  One of the key components in this book is about research ethics. We have heard many rumors about research ethics. This book talked about a similar situation occurred in the Noble Laurel David Baltimore's lab, in which a postdoc was involved some manipulations of data. I like the author's way of presentation: hinted but never gave a definite answer whether the postdoc did something wrong with the experiment or not.  In terms of science ethics, I would like recommend people reviewing one of the most horrible studies in modern history: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. This study was initiated by the United States Public Health Service, together with the Tuskegee Institute in 1932. The study recruited 399 black men diagnosed with syphilis in Macon County, Alabama to determine the effects of untreated syphilis. The study would last until 1970, way after the discovery of penicillin in 1943, which is the most effective drug to treat syphilis. Unfortunately, these black men, with the highest education at 7th grade, were only treated by aspirin and an iron supplement. It was till mass media caught this horror that halted this experiments. By then, many had died of complications of syphilis.  Although the book spent quite some length talking about trust, responsibility, authorship , lab rules, and in particular the peer pressure and jealousy, advisor seeking, tenure system, and gender discrimination, the author barely scratched the surface of publishing process, grant application and management, and other important research activities. It is possible that the author thought his intended readers are most likely undergraduates or beginning graduates. However, beginning graduates are eager to know how these research activities are like so that they can decide whether they want to seek academic jobs or not. Most time advisors are reluctant to talk about these issues with new graduate students. The author also devoted some pages on sex, especially on teacher-student type of sex. I am not sure why he blended sex in this book but it did add some vintages in it. The depicting of female scholars in this novel is too optimistic. That a fresh female chemistry PhD can get an assistant professorship in Harvard, Cal tech, and Wisconsin is amazing, if not shocking.  In terms of writing skills, the author seemed to have adopted a film making style. However, sometimes background events cut into flow of story too abruptly. Furthermore, the author lacked the ability to write juicy words when he was describing romantic events. His view of sex and romance was also old fashioned. I think the ending is the worst part of this novel. As we all know, academic people are good at insinuating things. A famous professor will never write a blunt insulting letter to another professor. I guess the author tried to give solutions to all problems left in the novel instead of giving some hints. This reflects his lack of confidence to his readers, which are at least college students ( I doubt a not prepared high school student can understand many concepts discussed in his book). In summary, if you don't know much about scientists, this book will give you a good kick start. If you are a graduate student who talk with your advisors very often, this book may be too simple to you. If you are a seasoned researcher, it is probably wiser to use your time on other amusements 
 I purchased this book over the summer and just tried to use it this week... unfortunately, I can't open any of the files that you need to do the lessons. Every time I try, I get an "unexpected file format" error, and I have tried on a couple of different computers. Of course, since I purchased it so long ago, I can't even return it. I am upset that the publishers didn't make an effort to make sure the files would work for everyone. There is nothing anywhere in the book that specifies if you need to be using Mac or Windows, and I can't even complain to the publishers because their Web site is all in Korean. $30 wasted 
 I'm semi-new to Hibernate. I've read through most of Hibernate in Action. The Hibernate Developer's Notebook as well. And I just wanted to get MORE familiar with Hibernate. Part of what I like out of a good computer programming book (and I've read many in my career) is when the authors walk you through the examples presented. In this book this happens in the first couple chapters. So far, so good. You think you're getting a thorough code walkthrough and so far you are. Then the authors begin refactoring code like crazy. Often in very subtle yet meaningful ways, but they never bother to explain themselves. So if you like to learn by typing the examples yourself, this book isn't for you. You'll quickly have to just plug their code in and read through their code, not allowed to code it yourself, because they just give up on presenting complete code examples and walk-throughs. I'm not sure if this is because they were trying to save paper or just didn't care, but they completely lost me at chapter 6. After I began having to go through the source downloaded from the website, I didn't care to read on. I just skimmed at that point. Because if I can't actually learn to write  the code myself it goes from being a teaching tool to a reference manual. As reference manuals go it's okay, but that's not what I was buying when I purchased this book. I was buying something to teach me "Hibernate Quickly". Good idea. Poor execution 
 This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not.  The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best.  Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book.  It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius. 
 Sad to say, I to agree with the previous reviewer - this book is a real disappointment.  Of course the title is incredibly vague, and is in one sense entirely true even if the authors merely mention both storytelling and organizations in passing.  They don't - in order to justify this title - have to tell us anything at all ABOUT storytelling or organizations.  Though having said that, I suspect that the title will lead most people to EXPECT to learn something about the use of storytelling in organisations, the what, the when, the why and the how.  Unfortunately, as the previous reviewer comments, only one of the four authors comes anywhere near meeting these expectations.  The book, which comes in at just under 200 pages - just under 180 if you ignore the index, the potted biographies and the "Further Reading" list - is divided into just six chapters.  Chapter 1 consists of 4 descriptions of "How I came to Storytelling" - one by each author. Chapters 2-5 inclusive are each allocated to a different author and consist, as far as I can tell, of (a) the transcript of the person's presentation at a conference on storytelling held in  2001, followed by the author's "reflections" approximately four years later. Chapter 6 is a "wrap up" chapter by Steve Denning on "The Role of Narrative in Organizations."  First problem - the way someone talks in a presentation should be quite different from the way they write the same information.  Apart from anything else, repetition is useful and necessary in a presentation - it can be boring and frustrating in a written text.  And that is certainly the case throughout most of this book.  Second problem - although the authors occasionally mention what one of their co-authors has said/written, the text doesn't link up particularly well.  Indeed, there seems to be a remarkable lack of agreement as to what this book is about.  Maybe the title wasn't dreamed up until after all the draft manuscripts were in?  In Chapter 2, Larry Prusak appears to be talking and writing about business communications in general - and Larry Prusak.  He certainly mentions "story" from time to time, but only a couple of days after reading his chapter I couldn't for the life of me remember anything that struck me as being the least bit significant about it.  Chapter 3, by John Seely Brown, likewise deals with business communications, though he does get as close to storytelling as the proverbial exchanges of information around the water cooler and the mobile phone equivalent.  Whilst this is certainly valid, to still be making it a key point in a chapter on storytelling in 2004 seems extremely "old hat."  Again, the chapter made no lasting impression as far as I was concerned.  Chapter 4, Steve Denning's initial chapter, was the first to actually address "storytelling," as such, IMO.  It certainly contains a few interesting pieces of information and some helpful examples, and if it had been supported by chapters of a similar calibre from Denning's co-authors then I'd be giving the book a 4 star rating at least. By itself, however, even when taken in conjunction with the wrap up chapter, Denning's contributions aren't enough to save the book, as a whole, from being thoroughly mediocre.  Just for completeness, Chapter 5, by Katalina Groh, seems to be primarily a major excercise in blowing a trumpet for her own film company.  Although she does make two or three important comments on storytelling, there is just so much repetition and waffle in this chapter that the good stuff is quickly buried by the dross.  Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the book is how little any of the authors - including Denning - seemed to understand about "how" to tell stories - which is maybe why that topic receives such scant coverage. For example, at one point Denning comments on his idea as to why storytelling is more effective as a way of conveying information compared with a simple presentation of facts and figures.  The crux of the matter, he tells us, on page 170, is that:  "We remember what is in a story because our feelings are reached and because the listener becomes personally involved with the story."  Well, that's open to discussion.  Not all stories automatically inspire a particularly emotional response, yet even then stories tend to be more easily remembered than plain facts and figures.  Why?  Because information is more easily remembered when it has a clear framework which makes it a coherent whole. In storytelling the story itself is the framework.  A list of facts and figures only becomes a whole if (a) a framework is provided along with the information, or (b) the listener already knows the context in detail, and/or (c) the listener is in any case used to receiving and dealing with information presented in this format.  Overall, a very underpowered and unsatifactory book.  
 It may be true that Dan S. Kennedy knows something about business, but there is no need for him to brag about it endulging himself in writing down and making other people read how great he is. It destroys ones willingness to adopt the few useful tips this book may have to offer. He should rather have written an autobiography. 
   I think the Linda Howard who wrote White Lies, Sarah's Child, Duncan's Bride, MacKenzies Mountain, Diamond Bay,etc. is one of the most talented current romance writers.  Unfortunately, when she gave up the genre romances and turned to the "big Time", her writing started to decline. She is clearly in over her head now.  What a shame she couldn't stick to a format in which she excelled and warmed the hearts of millions of readers.   This just goes to show that one should figure out where one excels and stick to it. This is pure "Peter Principle" in action. Too bad 
 There is some great activities on this toy, but there were problems on both sides. On the first side, the only way to get the face to light up and play music is to press hard, and hold the face for a second--what infant does that? Also the squeaky thing is hard for even me to press. My 8 month old liked the spinning flower though, if it is the only toy around.  On the older side there are much better activities. He is enjoying those more, but the pop-up feature won't work. It does not stay closed. If I do get it to close, just touch it and it pops up--you are supposed to learn to press the button. I found this toy in a local baby store after buying it, and 8 of 10 had the same problem. I haven't seen a better crib activity center, so we are still keeping it (mostly because I am not a returning type) 
 This book must have been the author's first attempt at writing a book. The book is poorly written. The author saw a way to get something in print about est and to make some money. This book should have never gone to print. I gave it two stars since you may gain an insight or two from this book but the sheer pain of trying to read this book is not worth the time. This is not due to the Landmark/est lingo but is due to the poor writing style of the author.  If you are looking for a book to provide some insights similar to Landmark Forum or the est training purchase the out of print book "The Book of Est." The book of est is written from the viewpoint of a person attending the est training.    
 This has to be one of the worst researched books written in this genre.  The author makes claim after claim without backing up anything with literature or some kind of evidence.  Even a fan of the speculation/science genre will find this book lacking of any basis for it's theories 
 I could honestly say, that the time this band was concieved, I did not like them at all, that was grade school people. But dumbfounded me decided back in I think it was 87 or 88, whatever it was bought Girls, Girls, Girls, boy what a let down that was I must say. I had a friend that idoled them, and I could not handle it, I had to put him out of his misery, just kidding, but I sure let him have it many times over. I just can't get into Vince Neil, nor the walking disease Tommy Lee, they both nausaete me too death with their perversions. And as far as the music goes, just pure garbage, fresh from the pile of leftovers from the cruddy hair band 80's. I would have to say, I would have a better time smacking myself with a hammer several times and get permanent brain damage than to happen to listen to these songs all over again 
 The writing seems to have come from under-educated teenage males who try too hard to look and sound cool.  I wasn't sure if I was reading a magazine or viewing an internet chatroom filled with juveniles.  This magazine isn't for men, it's for boys.   However, the one star is for the photos of the women which, we can't deny, both men and boys can appreciate 
 From the opening of the book on we learn that Philip Roth is the one with the ultimate wisdom. Using the Monica Lewinsky scandal - a recurring theme in the book - he shows us that we are all prude. The sexual revolution, which was brought to the literature by Philip Roth (among others), has failed. There is still much to do. For the remaining of the book Roth will try very hard to shock us, by using as much dirty language as possible. I have never heard anyone talking like that and I highly doubt that Philip Roth has. At times I thought, "Philip, you can relax, we know now that you know all these words!"  He will also write down his very own philosophy, and how he writes, how he manages to write pages and pages without developing any new idea, introduces the taste that here is someone who has understood it all. In this book, there are so many passages where you can just jump ahead without missing anything.   It is not a sign of good literature if you notice that not Zukerman, the narrator of the story, is the one speaking to us, but Philip Roth himself. And his tone has something of a know-it-all, and something bitter. After having read it, I thought that Roth is no-one I want to meet or I want to discuss with. Then I read some articles about him, and indeed, he has not the reputation of being an easy character. You feel that on every page of the book.  But the book has larger flaws. First, I do not like the narrative. It is Zukerman who speaks, and he is a first person narrator. At the same time he is omniscient and can replicate interior monologues of all the protagonists. I do not like this mix up, and I feel that Roth just does not manage this choice of perspective. Compare it with Great Gatsby or Brothers Karamazov where the author can control this kind of storytelling (a first person narrator) much better.  Then there are the inner monologues which are far from flawless or interesting. They are really quite pointless and, frankly, badly written. They go on pages and pages without making a point, without adding something to the story. If you have read Ulysses or Miss Dalloway, you see such a quality difference.   The book could have been so much better if well written. The topic - the individual and how it is shaped by society - is highly interesting. The main character, by looking for individuality, looses it totally, but only because the society does not want to accept him as he is. And at times, you can get an idea how brilliant Roth could be, would he take a little more time for his books, write less, but more carefully and would he be less egomaniacal. For example, we find out in detail how Silk characterizes Delphine Roux. Later, she characterizes Silk. How these individual characterizations diverge from their true characters is very interesting. Again, the topic how an individual is shaped by the behavior of others.  Well, there are far too few good scenes like that in the book to make up for the flaws. Given how many good books there are, I wouldn't waste my time on that one. 
 Not that great which is why it is not selling 
 I picked up this book expecting an easy yet interesting read...but what i found was an incredibly dry plot scattered with beaten down stereotypes and silly characters fitting perfectly into the mould of their respective roles. I haven't read her debut novel, a Breath of Fresh Air yet, but now that i'm done with this book, i'm wondering if it will be an unfortunate waste of time. 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 I must disagree with the people who have given this book five stars. Like many of them, I believe Ben Hogan was - and is - the greatest technician the game has ever seen. This book is, however, a disappointment.   The book can be broadly divided into two sections. The first is an account of John Schlee's Maximum Golf school. It covers Tom Bertrand's work with Schlee,  Schlee's relationship with Hogan, and his use of Hogan's techniques in his teaching. The second section is a breakdown of Hogan's swing fundamentals, including points that he hit upon AFTER publishing his 'Five Lessons' book.  The first section of this book provided an opportunity for an in-depth look at John Schlee and Hogan. It can hardly be coincidence that Hogan, a very singular character, chose Schlee - an equally singular character - as one of the few to whom he confided the secrets of his life's work. A thorough examination of these two men, their characters, and the parallels between them, would have been fascinating. It may also have shed some light on the nature of the relationship between golf and character. (I can't think of another sport with such potential appeal to character traits like obsession, perfectionism, even masochism.) While this is, at the end of the day, an instruction book, I would have loved to have seen the authors try to shed some light on Hogan & Schlee's characters through their golf - their approach to the game, their methods, techniques, goals and systems. It would have greatly enriched the book. It could have even added some depth of understanding of the techniques themselves. Perhaps most importantly, such an attempt may have given dignity to, and acknowledged the memory of, John Schlee. He deserved a better hand than Life dealt him in his last years. This book does not do him justice.  The instructional section of the book is at best, adequate. Much is made by the authors of their "tracking Hogan's secret" chronologically - which is nothing more or less than a quick run through Hogan's writing and interviews as to what he revealed and when. This section is not illuminating for anyone with even a passing knowledge of Hogan. Lastly, the detail of the swing moves and fundamentals themselves are set out briefly, with photos as visual aids. While adequate, they lack the flavour, clarity and depth that Hogan, Herbert Warren Wind and (illustrator) Anthony Ravelli employed with such skill and care in Hogan's 'Five Lessons.'  In short, this book strikes me as a magazine article that has been padded out with the intention of cashing in on Hogan's mystique and the obsessive need that golfers have to tinker with their swings. It serves as a pedestrian, adequate piece of instruction, but it's a missed opportunity. It is poorly written and it lacks ambition. It could have, and should have, been so very much more 
 Warner Bros strike again - ruining yet another cinematic masterpiece for DVD by ineptly encoding the audio as only Dolby Digital "1.0" - instead of "2.0 mono" or "2.1 mono" as most studios with half a brain (and an ounce of concern for their customers) would have done. Very few surround sound systems would have a full range centre speaker, and even if they did, they would find the audio on this DVD lacking in quality and presence. I was so annoyed with the audio that I found the DVD unwatchable in it's original form. Today I went to the trouble of doing a DVD-R copy, accepting the fact that the video would degrade slightly, but I ran the audio as downmixed 2 channel mono through a graphic equaliser to adequately boost the lower frequencies. I won't ever buy a DVD again which has its main audio track limited to Dolby Digital 1.0 and I recommend others do likewise 
 this review is pretty funny you have to admit..... "This band has the most retarded lyrics I've ever heard - "Sometimes the sun goes down, sometimes it goes back up, I'm wondering which one you are watching now." Huh?? Forget about the singer's gross melodramatic voice or the band's boring decision to steal riffs from the Strokes - just check out those lyrics!! The sun doesn't 'sometimes' go up and down, it ALWAYS goes up and down - ALWAYS - you morons. "I'm wondering which one you are watching now." Which one? Excuse me, last time I checked, we have only ONE sun, not two. Whatever. Maybe these hipsters should've spent more time in school and less time working on their hair. Their first record was trying to sound like Weezer and now they're trying to sound like Hot Hot Heat. How lame is that? And why are these guys trying so hard to look like the Strokes? They even have that token dude with the caucasion 'fro. I was suckered into seeing these guys at Spaceland last month and overheard the singer "pep-talking" his band. So embarassing. "Okay, guys, have fun tonight but make it look natural. You never know who might be in the audience. And don't forget, those fat girls in the front row bought some merch so pretend to be nice to them and we'll make fun of them later." Cool guys."  
 Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11."  Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption."  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.  If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel "Mission Accomplished. 
 These DVDs continue to be bitter disappointments. They crop the image, they only put 3 on a CD, and they release them sporadically. This is the last one I will ever buy - I just got a DVD burner and I'll burn new episodes. For old episodes, just head over to ebay, there are some wonderfully produced bootleg sets out there. I just dropped $70 for seasons 1&2 - gorgeous case, menus, high quality widescreen, and even bonus features. It could have been Time-Warner's $70, but they continue to be stupid and greedy about their DVD sets 
 Grandma bought the Curious George "DVD" for my 2 children and their cousin.  We popped it in to our DVD player and tried using our DVD remote and it didn't work.  I read the package and the box and nowhere does it tell you "Only for use with the Read With Me Controller".  Even at the Fisher Price website it is not explained very articulately.  Apparently you need to purchase a $25 "system" (aka-special remote control) that you program to interface with your own home DVD remote control and DVD player.  
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 Author Kevin Murphy, of course, was a writer/performer on the cult TV hit, "Mystery Science Theater 3000." As such, you'd think he'd have the sort of insight and humor that would make this book a great read for movie fans.  Unfortunately, though, Murphy spends most of his Year whining about contemporary moviegoing. Okay, so we know that multiplexes suck. We know that theater food is both bad and overpriced. We know that most modern movies suck, too. Murphy is right to point these things out, but he dwells on them page after page with little of the wit one might expect. And in his eagerness to knock even the better aspects of American cinema (dissing both "Pulp Fiction" and Jerry Lewis, for instance) while singing the praises of the most obscure of foreign documentaries, Murphy comes off as more movie snob than movie fan. To top it all off, there's an air of political correctness in much of Murphy's writing that turns up the smug factor. This was a great idea for a book, but it's neither as funny as you want it to be nor as definitive a comment on the current state of cinema as Murphy may have wanted it to be. A disappointment. 
 The kids got it for Christmas, and it looked like fun.  However, the one we got doesn't work at all.  I'm not sure if we just got a bad one or if this problem is common, but I can't even get it to turn on without changing the batteries, and then I can't get it to go into the game mode.  Plus, the rules of the electronic version are different, in that you lose all your points if you keep acting out words.  I prefer the rules of the old version better.  I'm planning to return this and get the old version 
 I struggle with this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, so part of me really likes this movie. But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks. If this appeals to you, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't like "Desert Heat." If even one of this doesn't sound good, stay far away 
 I was really disappointed to pick this book up and find that it is a dictionary of media terms.  Although it includes just about every possible media term out there, I expected more from Mr. Surmanek in terms of an updated version of his first book. Sorely disappointed. Returned the book and will continue the hunt for a great teaching book for beginners in the field like myself 
 Humour does date badly.  One of the jokes refers to a new building made in MCMLXXXIV...  1984 
 OK, I'm down with funk, and I've been down with the resergence in fusion/bugaloo/funk/jazz like MMW, Greyboy, Galactic. But I'm sorry, the turkish instruments just do not work here. Try imagining James Brown with  an Irish jig band playing along. Get my point? They just don't mix. Don't  get me wrong, I'm down with BFE. But did they have to throw the turks into  every jam? The mix was just too caustic 
 The problem with this game starts with the introductury movie... it develops slowly, goes on forever, suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play.   Once game play FINALLY does start, my child found the games boring and the TRANSITIONS between the games tediously slow.  Cute characters...zero edutainment.  It was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day 
 This phone would not charge for us - we had to send it back for a refund 
 I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge. 
 I am a simple man. And when I read a story, I would like to have the entire story before me, and not be forced to go to the internet to find the rest of it!!!!!!! This volume, incredibly, omits the third and final chapter of "A Jolly Corner"! It was an intersting experience, accidentally, because reading it without the last chapter made one confront the basic construct of the tale. It seemed incomplete after chapter two, but complete after chapter three. What was the missing element? The female character of absorption and empathy. So, I am glad that the compilation is a complete disaster, as it forced me to confront what this particular short story is really about: female human-ness vs  male ego driven self-delusion.  "Washington Square" is the only truly great work in the collection. I loved it.  I rate it a one because surely a person can read these stories on the internet in their complete form. 
 These calipers are not up to any form of reliable measurement, because its premise is far too simple.  The instructions include no equations of any kind, and the pinch is intended only for the abdominal skin-fold.  Once you measure the skinfold, you take the result (in millimeters) and compare to a color-coded chart which pairs a man/woman's age and measurement to show the bodyfat percentage within the colored stripes of (ideal, overweight, obese, etc.).  This is too simple for a bodyfat measurement.  There was no regard for body weight, height, or other skin-fold areas.  It would have been nice if the instructions at least included equations so that I could measure myself more accurately on my own--but, no.  Granted, the "click" feature is pretty cool, and lets you know exactly how much pressure to apply while measuring.  However, if you're a trainer or someone seriously trying to lose body fat and measure your progress, you'll need normal calipers with formulas.  This is too basic.  A toy 
 Bob Roberts is as relevant today as it was some fourteen years ago. Converting ideological outsiders does not seem to be its primary goal. It is echo chamber entertainment meant only for the already committed leftist. Needless to point out, this is not exactly surprising. Tim Robbins, after all, who starred, directed, and even sang in the  film is one of Hollywood's best know radical personalities. To be blunt, he is a less talented Oliver Stone. The script turns conservatives into cartoon characters. There is no attempt whatsoever to try understanding their world view. They are simplistically portrayed as fascists seeking any excuse to justify taking over the country. Bob Roberts (Tim Robbins) is a Republican U.S. senatorial candidate hoping to defeat incumbent Pennsylvanian Democrat Brickley Paiste (Gore Vidal). He is vile and not above using dirty tricks to achieve his aims. As the story unfolds, Roberts is well behind in the polls. A leftist journalist portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito tries to further derail Roberts' campaign by revealing his drug running and other criminal activities. Will he be successful? Can a journalist representing a small left-wing publication take down the rich and powerful? You will not be glued to your seat due to the suspense, but the story line isn't a complete bore. If nothing else, you will see countless well known motion picture stars come and go throughout the story.   Did you ever wonder why the far-left became unglued over the Iraqi liberation of 2003? Well, Bob Roberts should help enlighten you. It makes numerous references to Desert Storm, our first invasion of Iraq in 1991. The conflict was allegedly a conspiracy concocted by the devious right-wing "National Security Council." This group really runs the country, and not our elected leaders. The Republican administration of George Bush 41 only wanted to dominate the region. Our greedy military-industrial complex had to be satisfied, and would not take no for an answer. Saddam Hussein was not another Adolph Hitler---but a minor league dictator. Senator Brickley Paiste dismisses him as merely another member of "the villain of the month club."

 I normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic American literature.  However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of "thy" and "thou" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, "How do you call yourself?" instead of "What is your name?" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is "How do you call yourself" better than "What is your name"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these "translations" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.  I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish.  
 I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.    I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.    That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you.  
 "Internal Combustion" by Edwin Black is an entertaining but uneven history about the control of energy with a purported emphasis on the ascendancy of the gasoline-powered automobile. To his credit, Mr. Black has managed a substantive research project that has uncovered a great deal of arcane historic information about the automotive industry. Unfortunately, this preachy book suffers from an acute lack of focus, where it is suspected that the large amounts of extraneous background material was added in an attempt to obscure the book's shortcomings. Indeed, the author ultimately fails to prove his central thesis, thereby casting doubt about the validity of both his research and his conclusions.  Mr. Black opens the book with a scene depicting the burning of Thomas Edison's research laboratories in December, 1914. Mr. Black's conspiracy theory proposes that sinister forces aligned with the gasoline-burning automotive industry may have intentionally destroyed the world's one and only hope to mass-produce an electric car. Unfortunately, Mr. Black provides no evidence to prove this allegation.    Mr. Black attempts to buttress his case by explaining that electric vehicles were once utilized as taxis in New York and other major cities in the late nineteenth century and, therefore, could have and should have been mass marketed to an appreciative public. We are supposed to accept Mr. Black's thesis that success would have been an inevitable and logical outcome despite the severe weight, cost and range limitations of the electric car when compared with the gasoline automobile. In fact, while Thomas Edison and Henry Ford were still tinkering with an electric alternative a full thirteen years after gasoline-powered vehicles had already been in mass production, it is evident to the reader that internal combustion vehicles prevailed because they were affordable, the first to market and could traverse longer distances than electric cars. That all of this was not a good development for people's health and the environment is not in dispute; rather, it is Mr. Black's contention that the white-hatted purveyors of electric vehicles could have prevailed save for the obstructionism of the black-hatted petroleum industry that remains in question.    In the end, what is conspicuously lacking throughout the book is a credible attempt at analyzing and critiquing the history of governmental and popular struggle with the fossil-fuel industry. But instead of scholarship, we have a vainglorious author who is determined to salvage the barren results of two years' worth of study by substituting analysis with a highly questionable work of narrative. The end result is little more than a masquerade of nonfiction; at best, it is a book that might have limited appeal to readers who crave pseudo-historicism at the expense of intellectual rigor, consistency, insight or coherence. 
 I really tried to like this book, but Mr. Santorum's efforts fell far short of the fiery, self-righteous rhetoric that I have come to expect in a social satire.  While he included the requisite ramblings about "libruls an' commies", completely missing were the mouth-breathing rants about bestiality and "durn Frenchies" that first drew me to Rick's comedic wit.  He did have me smirking with his views on education and "intelligent design", but I could tell his heart really wasn't in it.  Not his best work; he's much more funny on C-SPAN 
 I can respect director Adam Marcus for trying to pull away from the series and do something different, but we already had the BS Ft13th movie: Part V.  Jason wasn't the killer.  Technically, Jason is the killer in this movie, but it's not really.  You'll see what I mean when you see the movie, and it is worth a see, but by the 7th or 8th movie, they were movies for the fans.  They stopped making them to be innovative by the 5th movie and were just making them to make money and entertain the audience.  Adam Marcus wanted to be innovative with Jason Goes to Hell, and it doesn't work.  Not for fans or an average audience.  There's nothing interesting about seeing random people who act like Jason walking around and killing people, not to mention WITHOUT the trademark machete.  They could've at least given these people a little personality with the machete, but whoever called that one thought they were doing the series a favor.  The introduction of Jason having a sibling, niece, and now a great niece (I think?) by the 9th movie in the series is a little too late, sorry.  We would've had to know about these people by at least the 3rd or 4th movie to make us care about their struggle.  Another thing:  Jason as a snake/demon creature crawling around the floor?  Hmm... I wasn't under the impression that Jason was really evil in the first place.  Let me explain:  Jason has been made out to be mentally/physically disabled.  If Ginny in Part 2 was able to convince him that she was his mother by wearing her sweater, than Jason isn't evil at all, he just loves his mom and kills all the victims because he believes that they're responsible.  So, Jason as a wierd little hell creature doesn't necessarily work when bringing it into the context of the other movies.  The design of Jason's actual appearances in the movie doesn't make sense either.  What happened between part 8 and 9 to get his mask somehow buried and melded into his face?  Why does he look fat?  Where did his hair come from?  At least Part 8 had some respect for the look and personality of Jason, while it might not have been the best in the series it was at least satisfying to see him the way we know him, and not make drastic changes which don't even benefit his appearance.  Adam Marcus, I can respect you for trying to make your own movie, and yeah, it's definately yours.  Don't try and make your own movie the 9th movie in a series of movies that are about the fans, and don't BS the fans with your idea of an improvement of the series.  I'd say, fans should see this movie just to see it.  It's worth the view and the surprise cameo at the end.  *wink* 
 This album was released in 1999. And now, seven years later, this album does not even matter. Britney Spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child. Great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity, innovation, creativity, and ability to transcend cultures and generations. Great music stirs something inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it. Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally. And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades, even - after their release. Music like this, Britney Spears and her peers, disappears into the folds of time. It does not matter. 
 Not much to say about this one,just that it's REALLY bad. The only half way decent song is the flame, and that gets old fast 
 I recently read "I", "K", and "L" in succession.  Compared to "Innocent" and "Killer", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising.  With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line.  I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome.  Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).  I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in "L" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.  Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly ("M" being one of them) 
 I hate it when they release "inspired by" music! Very little of this CD was music actually from the movie! If you look closely at the cover you'll see the words, "Music from and inspired by..." This is not the CD Soundtrack from the movie, or at least only a couple of the songs are really from the movie and the rest in "inspired" by it! I was disappointed when I first bought this CD in a store, because I like the theatrical scores with orchestras. This is not that CD from the cover and sample selection 
 This book was created as a money making scheme for shady Chiropractors. They paid to get into the book so they could say they are published experts and use this status to trick vulnerable people out of their money! 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 In the U.K. there is an annual award for the worst written sex scene is a novel. This writer does not write novels. Whether he writes fiction is open to dispute. Be that as it may I would like to create a new award for Deeply Cheesy Concepts In A Work About A Spiritual Path. Among an embarressment of riches in this writers oeuvre, I would like to nominate the concept of....Deh deh duh deh!  "Vajra Romance!" Just repeating the words with its echos of Hello magazine, and Hollywood makes my sphincter contract in dismay. Madonna should record a song by the same title. "take a chance on Vajra Romance,                  at the Emptiness and Form Dance (baby). It is surely only a matter of time before Madge "reinvents" herself by abandoning an ersatz Kabbalah for an ersatz Vajrayana, and we know where she will find that dont we? "The dance between emptiness and form " features large too. Emptied though of any of the subtlety found in the Heart Sutra, or any indication that the writer has any understanding other than the pedestrian use to which he puts this most profound teaching. It is hard to know beneath the hip rhetoric what the vajra-hell he IS going on about. Hoever, "Emptiness And Form" seems to be reduced to an elaboration on attraction and aversion. Not that he would ever say anything so mundane, in the absence of any glimmer of understanding of Tantra, Sutra, or Dzogchen, the writer deploys to a kind of sub-Ginsberg poesy, but without the poesy. Avoid, gentle reader, read Pema Chodren. N.B. Those reviwers who say that the fact that The Aro gTer do not represent an authentic lineage does not matter are sadly mistaken. The Aro is claiming to be just that. Its relevence stands or falls on that fact. NO teacher of The Nyingma Lineage accepts them as authentic, not one, apart from the sister org. the equally spurious  Flaming Jewel Sangha. The reference in a review to Chogyam Trungpa is unfortunate, I was fortunate to receive personal teaching from Trungpa Rinpoche, and can assure those interested that a) He saw authenticity of Lineage as of absolutely paramount importance and B) He would have seen through the Aro in five seconds, and would have said so. If people want to make "jazz riffs" loosely based on certain aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, let them at least have the guts to go and found their own religion, not distort and usurp an exsisting one. An update,( august 06 original review written in 05) Madonna is reported to be indeed tiring of Kabbalah, Chogyam, this could be your year! The bigtime 
 I'm sorry, but I really don't! It's a style called Celtic Drama, which means it's a combination of stories w/o words and traditional Irish Dancing.  I've never been a Michael Flatley person.  Parts of this are traditional Irish dancing, but other's aren't anywhere near it! There are also long songs, sort of like a choir piece. I don't like those at all.  If you want to see traditional Irish dancing, this is not your movie 
 I can see by the abundance of good reviews that the formula of using template beats is alive and well.  Any one of us could have made this album.  Just go to a neighborhood teenager with a drum machine pay him $100 to purchase 11 minutely variant beats and you have this album.   This album has absolutely no originality.  We have heard this album many times before and I'm sure we will hear it many times in the future.  I give it two stars for the fact that it does make for adequate generic r&b background music for a lite dinner party 
 This book is a laugh and not much else. This guy is the uberpale, black-eyeliner-wearing, black-hair-dying version of Silver RavenWolf: cheesy, full of himself and completely useless.  Aside from that, the idea of nocturnal witchcraft is highly impractical. Yes, a lot of us are night people and work better at night. But this guy is practically suggesting a WORSHIP of the night, like some sort of Wiccan vampire or something.  Don't waste your money or time on this book. You have better things to do at night, like REAL witchcraft, or even sleep 
 You know how some books create characters and a world you love so much, you try to read slower because you don't want the book to end?  This is not one of those books.  I'm a fairly fast reader so I always finish any book I start.  I have never regretted this policy more than now.  I am three quarters of the way through this book and the end can't some soon enough for me.  The best part of the book was the lengthy "Acknowledgement".  The author seems to be a nice person and I feel bad panning her book but if I can save anyone the misery I'm in, I have to do it.  If you want vampire/romance, read the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton 
     If you are looking for any sort of objective presentation of Quantum Physics you've come to the wrong place.  What you will find are cherry-picked Quantum-moments of lucidity, punctuated with the wolf man's brand of metaphysical interpretation.  Unless you have a firm grasp of the concepts being presented you may find yourself easily lost in this very biased, " Physics for Nonscientists. "  I give this one star for those poor flatlanders who may never understand the pyramid, as being more than triangle or a square respectively. 
 This book should have been titled, "Tokyo for Kids".  I was extremely excited to get this book but my excitement faded to disappointment when I opened it's cover to only find mostly things that realated to the Tokyo area.  I am currently living in Japan with my husband and daughter and was hoping for more of an insiders view of things to do in Japan.  However, I live quite a distance from the Tokyo area and had hoped to find out about things more locally, or even within a more resonable distance then Tokyo.  It would have been nice to see more comprensive coverage of Japan.  Not everyone who lives here, flocks to the Tokyo area.  Although I do plan to visit there at least once while living here, it is not close enough to be the focus of weekend or even monthly outings. There were a few other areas mentioned, but it seemed to me that the authors of this book did not take enough time to throughly reasearch all areas of Japan. There is some useful information in here as far as contacts and ordering, but if you live anywhere outside Tokyo, I can not reccomend this book to you. It is a well written and informative book for what it is, but it should not have been titled, "Japan for Kids", nor claimed to be the ultimate guide.. 
 If you picked up this book to help you build your existing business or build a new one, you might be disappointed. Since your thinking of starting your own business, then you should know that most small businesses fail within the first five years. The author hits on some reasons why they fail but most of these you already know. Do you know that if you are not organized, if you don't change or create new ideas or plans and become stagnat or if you force yourself to do every task yourself, your business will be limited in growth and may eventually fail? Right there is the first 25% of the book fit into one sentence. Then he goes onto his love affiar with turn key businesses. But when he starts talking about his favorite business it should make a reader nervous. He starts talking about the great sucess of McDonalds fast food restuarant franchise. McDonalds is a great success and one to be looked at carefully but not for the reasons he points out. It's apparent he has not been in a McDonalds all that often. He mentions that at McDonalds they depend on consistancy at all their chains. For example the fries stay in the fryer for ten minutes "a soggy french fry is not a McDonald's french fry". At any McDonalds a customer knows what to expect. Then he goes into mention that this is why McDonalds chain resturant is more successfull than those businesses that depend on trade name recognition. I'm sorry this throws a red flag. People eat there beacuse it is fast and it is [not expensive}, not becuase of consistant service. They make a large profit because they keep costs down. I do believe that McDonalds spends a large budget on trade name recognition, I have seen many commercials for McDonalds within the last year; particularly with the Olympics. This whole section undermines the rest of the author's book. If you know that a large section is misleading or biased it makes it difficult to listen to the rest the ideas without already being judgemental. I admit that I am not the smartest business person but its clear Michael Gerber isn't either 
 I didn't like this movie at all. The acting was good. Saw it in the theatre and I feel asleep three times. It was boring and flashed back too much but the book was much better and I felt that three hours for this movie was way too long. Would have been better renting this than spending $7.50 to see it in the movies. A good movie for insomniacs. 
 Home Business Magazine is a publication aimed at those members of the general populace who either already own a home based business or who have an active interest in the subject and would like to pursue it further. This magazine contains articles relating to all facets of home business ownership from the initial setup all the way through to the payment of taxes at year end.   I read several different business magazines and many of them have to do with entrepreneurship. Home Business is the only one I read that is specifically devoted to starting a business in the home and, unfortunately, it has many flaws that prevent it from being the enjoyable and informative read that it otherwise could be. Probably the most annoying feature of this magazine is the articles themselves and their tendency to be written in a list- type format rather than in a user- friendly way. I realize that people like lists but Home Business takes this a little too far. It makes the magazine seem callous and unfriendly- something you would consult in the same way you would an almanac. For example, it is common to find a one page article with a title like "Effective Ways to Design a Newspaper Ad", or "How to Obtain Quick Financing". In each instance, these articles will have a short opening consisting of a paragraph or two followed by a numbered listing of different methods/suggestions to solve the problem or answer the question. This makes the magazine read more like a reference guide than a piece of reading material.   Another thing that is annoying about this magazine is the endless advertising. Not only does it get out of hand, it also includes all sorts of ads that emphasize money- making schemes and other similar material. Advertisements with titles like "Really Lazy Guy's Incredible Little Secret Idea Can Make You Rich", "Free $9.95 Report Shows You How to Make a Fortune", and "Six Figures in Six Months" clutter the pages of this magazine with get- rich quick garbage that everyone knows is unlikely to return even the cost of the introductory package.   Some parts of this magazine are more bearable than others and it's this handful of positive attributes that prevent me from giving this magazine a one- star rating. I like some of the success stories because they depict ordinary people who have succeeded at making a living with a home- based business. But even here, the stories are inconsistent. Some are educational in nature while others have little valuable information to share. And to make matters worse, they are far too short- usually covering only one- half page each with a large advertisement taking up the space at the bottom of each page.   Speaking of the advertising, this magazine wrote the book on advertisement excess. Advertisements cover about 75 percent of the pages in each issue and it is rare to see even two pages in a row without some sort of advertisement. The ads are posted everywhere, often right in the middle of an article, and they distract greatly from the already limited enjoyment of the magazine.   This magazine is assembled together in such a way that it reads like a collection of articles taken from people in different parts of the country that were shuffled around and published in one magazine. In other words, this magazine has no continuity to it. It's like taking short articles from different business newspapers around the USA and then piecing them together into one magazine.   Starting a home- based business is a goal that many people set for themselves and there is always a need for some good, timely information when you find yourself in this situation. Home Business, unfortunately, doesn't perform its mission very well. If you dig deeply enough you can find a few good articles. But the majority is too impersonal and too shallow (not to mention smothered in advertisements) to make this magazine worth the trouble.  
 More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff 
 This is boring faceless alt country indie rock. These guys have less outlaw cred than John Kerry at a 1000 dollar a plate dinner. Normally I don't knock bands for doing their own thing, but here the affectation is too much."when we leave this place and drive back to carolinaand down to savannah and stay.." yeah right. Friggin Seattlites. Maybe drive down to Olympia to get some chai tea. It strikes me how if any band musters up a few country chords, and wear trucker hats they will get a decent review on pitchfork.

 Ana Carolina is a good singer and Seu Jorge is a cult culture figure here in Brazil, but this CD is a mistake. Do not spend money on this 
 This book is okay. It never really immerses you in the world--instead you just sort of skim along the top of it, half-caring about what happens next. Everyone feels like a stock characters: the "bad guys" are bumbling idiots, and the good guys (even Peter) are self-sacrificing and far-seeing. We barely even see the task force which calls itself the Starcatchers, and the book really could have survived without them. Tinkerbell doesn't show up till the last page or so (I spent most of the book wishing for the fairy to come breathe some complexity and life into the cast), and the croc never eats the clock.  As an avid Dave Barry fan, I could literally pick out which lines had been written by him. Not to say that the book was funny (because, unfortunately, it was not)--his style just flashes off the page in neon colors.  A few innuendoes will raise eyebrows--they really shouldn't have been in a book so geared toward children.  There are better books out there. Buy them instead 
 About 1st book: Taira Shinken is a well know name in Okinawan Kobudo. His "RyuKyu Kobudo Taikan" stands as a reference on Okinawan Kobudo technique not polluted by modern fashion which is almost always the result of plain ignorance and show-business. Mr. McCarthy issued this english version of the old master work apparently for the benefit of non-japanese practitioners.  However there are some issues: 1 - He boldly replaced all the pictures of sensei Taira Shinken for pictures of himself and one of his pairs. Some pictures, mainly the in kon-bo katas show some irregular handling of the weapon (with hands too close to each other) and some indefinite stances which can puzzle some inexperienced practicioners. 2 - He didn't respect the original material. Every kata in Shinken Taira original work has been somewhat changed! Techniques were added, omited or replaced in all katas! An entire sequence is different in Shushi-no-Kon.  Old katas were made as a global repository of knowledge by old masters in a age of practical life-threatening fighting. The knowledge they contain is unique and irreplaceable. Modern fancy-athletic-acrobatic pseudo-kata cannot compare and never will! These katas can have some school or local variations which should be respected and considered when looking for a "reference" form. Each new generation should try to respect the old forms keeping in mind that there is no way of reliably testing and improving them in life-threatening situations nowadays as they once were.  Works such as "Ryukyu Kobudo Taikan" should not be altered: they are a personal testimony of a great master and document uniquely an entire epoch and a long martial tradition.  I advise everyone interested seriously in Okinawan Kobudo to buy the recently re-issued japanese version of Taira Shinken work featuring the original (yes! They are still usable!) illustrations (along with Mr. McCarthy's "interpretation" if one doesn't read japanese) in order to get the correct knowledge.  About 2nd book: The 2nd book of the series is a repository of reference historical documents about traditional Karate featuring precious info about old karate masters and the true spirit of Karate. It's mostly text-based with only 10 b/w pictures but has a lot of "juice" in it. It should find a prominent place in the library of the serious karateka. 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 I am extremely disappointed in this book. After all the hype (the author proclaimed he was very successful, building 60 homes a year at his peak), this book appears to be written by someone who has never set foot on a building site.  It is virtually all written in generalities, with very little useful or valid information pertaining to contracting. This book really lacks SPECIFICS!! A lot of what the author does is just write "fluff," or "filler." In other words, much of his writing is just wasted space.  I believe that the positive reviews on this book were either written by morons, people who think "fluff" is good writing, or most probably, friends of the author who are trying to increase sales of his book.  It's really a shame, because I have the feeling that the author really does know about the building business. Too bad that he didn't choose to impart any specific knowledge to the people who forked over $25-30 for his book.  The author should be ashamed of this piece of work. It's really a ripoff. If you are a budding young contractor like me,   DO NOT waste your money on this book! Or, your valuable time.  
 I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it.. 
 I have NOT seen the movie, so this review is only based on the book.  This book was highly regarded by a few family members as a beautiful read.  Sure, the descriptions are lovely and well written, but the whole idea of a memoir is suppose to be interesting--this is not.  I love travel memoirs, reading peoples travel stories, but this was like reading a guide to restore a house--very dry.  Ms. Mayes writing reminds me of David Sedaris mocking a wealthly tourist, "My home, well... ONE of my homes".    I have decided to give the book another try. XM Sonic Theater is playing the book and it is being read by the author.  However, Ms. Mayes monotone voice and lack of live storytelling makes the story even worse.  I understand why authors have voice actors to read the books.    The book is written lovely, but does not exceed the expectation I was excepting. 
 It gave me a headache. I found nothing enlightening about it. I subscribe to the belief that in truth there is beauty and simplicity. In science it can be a simple formula expressing a profound idea such as E=mc^2. I guess it's a great academic exercise for those who have the time. Where's the clarity. I subscribe the KISS concept. Life/being at least in the physical sense appears very short from where I'm sitting. I'd rather embrace life with joy and whatever form my being has taken and savor the time I have. That to me has real meaning. To each his/her own we will probably never know if we got it "right" or  will MH. Or perhaps he finally did 
 Save your money.  Buy a book from one who has the expertise to write on this subject.  Bernard Moitessier can say more in a few pages than this  book has to offer 
 This slim volume might be worth the price at 18 dollars, but the $45 students are forced to pay for this book, used as a textbook, is outrageous. The book's vocabulary and its assumptions about the level of knowledge of the reader lumps it in with juvenile literature. For example, it tells the reader that ancient Greeks and Romans had a democratic form of government, and that democracy means the citizens vote, just like in the United States.   The book appears an attempt to "candy-coat" (almost literally!) history for cooking students who are assumed to know nothing of it. It has long sections of history at a 9th-grader's level, with only minimal coverage of foodstuffs at some points.   Worse, it is riddled with errors and inaccuracies. For example, the last section I read before returning it for a refund covered sourdough bread. Civitello said that San Francisco sourdough really is different, as San Franciscans claim, because "the yeast in the air of San Francisco is a different variety, lactobacillus sanfrancisco." This is blatantly wrong, as lactobacillus is a bacterium and yeast is a mold. It was delightful to learn, after some online research, that the bacterium lactobacillus sanfrancisco does contribute to the unique taste of San Francisco sourdough. But the statement in the book was clearly wrong, and typical of the level of accuracy throughout 
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 This is so far one of the most boring Nora Roberts books, ever.  It was OK but it seriously was a PUSH to get through it, and usually I simply just fly through her novels.  The characters are very flat and uninvolved.  I was able to guess whodunit way before the act was even done, as well as guess some of the plot twists.  The book was fun for the trip to Hollywood-land but besides that it was a LONG book (528 pages) that really would have been better off slimmed down.  Lots ado about nothing which leads to boring repeat events and pointless happenings that in the end you discover served no purpose at all to the story.  If you are a NR fan, you may like it but I suggest perhaps finding another novel to read first and borrow this one from a friend.  
 I didn't find this book very useful.  The marketing and strategy considerations are very basic and didn't give me a lot of new insight into brand creation.  The examples that he uses from other industries border on trite and are much better illustrated elsewhere.  If you are starting from scratch, however, it may be an interesting place to start.  It asks some of the basic questions that an entrepreneur needs to answer and has some entertainment value, albeit with frequent and not-so-subtle doses of self-promotion 
 Not funny enough to succeed as satire, and certainly not erotic.  When I read the blurb annoucement that this was a satire on Voltaire's CANDIDE, my first reaction was, "How do you write a satire of a satire?"  The answer is, you can't; and CANDY ends up as just another tired, outdated...book.  Don't judge Southern by this novel... 
 This book is extremely remedial.  The book is mostly fluff with about 4 solid concepts.  The guys in the book do not appear to be 'nice guys' either, but horny toads with poor social skills.  the book does nothing to address actual relationships beyond the introduction and the bedroom.  Conclusion: pretty much garbage 
 This text is by far the worst college text I have encountered in my educational career.  Where most texts stick to relevant facts and figures relating to their area of study, this text delves into opinion coupled with unbridled conjecture.  The text is littered with political opinions and political assumptions made about its reader, while listing irrelevant facts and theories that support a socialist Democrat view of the society of the United States.  Karl Marx and Socialism are continually defended as just economic forms of society while Capitalism is openly bashed at every page turn.  Conspiracy theories thrive in this book as it even accuses the United States' representational democracy as being ineffective, and that the country is actually ran by a conspiratorial "power elite."  The author often inserts personal opinion and biased so-called "personal experiences" with social issues as facts, and assumes the reader is a freshmen student unable to discern his fact from his fiction.   Here is a short excerpt from page 189, contained within a chapter dealing with social class:  Like many people, you may have said to yourself, "Sure I can vote, but somehow the big decisions are always made despite what I may think.  Certainly, I don't make the decision to send soldiers to Afghanistan or Iraq.  I don't launch missiles against Kosovo, or Baghdad.  I don't decide to raise taxes or interest rates.  It isn't I who decides to change welfare benefits."  I think it is clear here and in other excerpts from the text that the author should be writing editorials for his local newspaper instead of college texts.  It seems to me that the author intends to mold the minds of the college youth in his political image under the guise of giving a factual accounting of the field of Sociology.  I absolutely do not recommend this book to anyone, and think it is time to inform my university of the contents of this text before more students are forced to purchase it in its next incarnation.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.  If you feel the same as I do about this text, then please speak up at your local university and here.  
 This product is NOT what I expected. Unlike my old VHS cleaner/rewinder this one does not use a cleaning solution and does not clean the VHS tapes as well.  My old Cleaner/Rewinder had a hole to put several drops of cleaning solution much like the head cleaners for VHS machines, it had what was referred to as cleaning heads which where felt and replaceable.   This Machine has a plastic post that rests against the tape as it rewinds but does NOT clean very well. I made 3 attempts to clean 1 VHS tape with little accomplishment.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone as a tape CLEANER, as a REWINDER it works fine 
 Haier RTC1700 Extra Large Capacity Convection Oven would be great if the company did a better job puting it together. The first one worked for 1.5 weeks then the power went out on it. Sent for a new one and it came with the door not put together right. Part of the hinge was missing. Not happy with this at all. Will not deal with this company again. I bought this as a gift for my mother and she is the one who has had to deal with this mess. Elizbeth, NV.  
 It is quite interesting to view an old Hollywood version of the corps of discovery. The historical truth is far from being respected, the Native Americans speak beautiful english, Lewis and Clark are rival lovers...still, the film is worth viewing if you want to compare the story line with that of the real trail blazer's story 
 This book is very good until just before the end. There are too many things left unanswered at the end. For example - (1)What was the exact relation between Williams and one of the cousins? (2)When was the microphone placed in the office and by whom? (3)What was the role of the personal secretary in the conspiracy?   ...And many more! 
 This book has some good information in it, but it is mostly fluff, filler and repetition. Each time I sit down to read it, I fall asleep because there is so much filler. The book could easily be reduced to a pamphlet-sized book without any sacrifice of information.  I like to know how and why, and I don't mind reading on and on if the how and why is explained. I even enjoyed the China Study, which has a lot of explanatory text to support statements. Most people would call the China Study a dry read, but every word has a purpose. The Miracle of Fasting is mostly just empty words with statements only weakly backed up by the author's personal observations, not science. I think there are some useful tidbits in this book, but I would suggest you borrow this book from a friend or the library if you can. I am hoping to find a more comprehensive book on the subject of fasting. Any suggestions 
 Davis was a hired gun who jammed, misfired, missed the mark, blew up in everyones face. Contrary to what he would have you believe, he didn't found Lycos -- he was brought in (admittedly on day two) by his pals at CMGI. The real story here is how and why did Davis blow it so bad and huge? He was "first mover" as much as Yahoo and he had every advantage they had, etc. -- except apparantly Yahoo's brains. (Davis's dim tough guy act isn't really an act at all -- its thye real Bob, rough and tough with muscle where gray matter should be.) So instead of being a category leader and defining early web brand and company, Lycos ends up being fourth in a race with three winners (AOL, MSN and Yahoo). Forget the laudantory blurbs -- all those folks are Davis's personal pals who thru barely legal scheming made a mint on Lycos inflated stock price. If you want management expertise, you'll get more out of "Body by Jake.&quot 
 [...] For an excellent rebuttal of Dombrowski and Deltete's pro-abortion position, see the first chapter of Robert P. George's 'The Clash of Orthodoxies.' George, a Roman Catholic, is a professor at Princeton University.  The following is an excerpt from the Seattle Catholic article by Anne Barbeau Gardiner:  The authors make a sharp distinction between the unborn child being "merely human" (i.e., having human parents and genes) and being "a human person in some morally relevant sense." Their most striking and pervasive analogy in support of this distinction is the one between an unborn child and vegetation, as when they say, "The early fetus is obviously alive, as is grass."  In their view, the unborn child is like vegetation until very late in the pregnancy when sentience begins, a term they define as the capacity to perceive pain. They argue that sentience arises only when the central nervous system is functioning. Oh, but what a slippery slope this is! They keep shifting the date when the unborn child attains this mysterious quality. First they say it is hard to tell if there is "a morally considerable being at twenty-four weeks of pregnancy or not until twenty-eight weeks." As it turns out, they are unsure the unborn child has sentience until the eighth month. Even then they declare vaguely that "the fetus becomes morally considerable between twenty-four and thirty-two weeks when sentiency, and then the cerebral cortex, starts to function." The thirty-second week verges on the ninth month!  The authors inform us that performing an abortion on a "nonsentient" child (which, as we have just seen, can be up to the eighth month) is like mowing the lawn. Here are their very words: "It is unclear to us, however, why killing a nonsentient being is rash or precipitous. We do it all the time with equanimity when we mow the grass." Elsewhere they say that an abortion is "like pruning one's rose bush." These are chilling analogies. But do they actually work as analogies? No. For when one prunes a rosebush, it is to make it bloom more abundantly; when one mows the grass, it is to make it grow thicker and stronger. But when one aborts a child, does that child's capacity to grow improve? Not a bit. Little wonder that the authors attack the pro-life film The Silent Scream as being "at best, misleading, and, at worst, fraudulent." This heartrending film shows an unborn child in the throes of an abortion and makes it plain that there is no likeness here to grass or a rosebush. As ultrasounds reveal, a child in the womb reacts to touch after eight weeks, something that grass and a rosebush cannot do at any stage. .. 
 I will not repeat what others have written here about this book... but I've really got to say it. THIS BOOK IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!  
 While conducting business in Greece during WWII, American writer Mike Morrison is trapped by the German advance.  When he comes into possession of a secret list of Greek patriots who are pretending to be collaborators, he must go on the run to escape the enemy forces that have been assigned to retrieve the information.  This is the only book by Leon Uris that I have read.  I was under the impression that he was a writer who researched his subjects meticulously.  Perhaps this was one of his first books, because there is very little local color here, nothing that one couldn't glean from watching movies and skimming a few travel books.  Worse than that, the characters and situations are cliché from start to finish, and the prose is dull.  It reads like a treatment for a typical 50s WWII flick 
 Lian Hearn lost me on this one.  This is the third and final book of the original Tales of the Otori trilogy (there's a fourth book set decades after this one ends that reportedly resolves the one dangling issue from the trilogy) and it is easily the worst.  Across the Nightingale Floor was very good with swift pacing, a mentally tough heroine and solid action; Grass for his Pillow was a decent middle volume that moved the story forward, set up the final book and did not lose too much momentum.  Brilliance of the Moon is a relative flop.  The two main characters, Takeo and Kaede, make laughably stupid decisions.  Kaede loses too much of her inner strength -- she becomes simply the damsel in distress.  And the anti-climactic, deus ex machina resolution to Takeo's quest is entirely too unsatisfying.    If you can read Book 1 and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel despite its status as the first in a trilogy/tetralogy, do so.  But you're forewarned before you get too deep into the story, the ending in this volume is pure disappointment 
 These were purchased for my Grandson for Christmas. They are hard to get on. Clumsy and don't have the effect they would have you believe. He never really used them and  a waste of money. They were useless and also very dangerous.  Defintely would not recommend. 
 Freedom of speech.  Ya gotta love it.  It gives any two bit hack the right to get up on a podium and spout his pop psychology to draw in however many supporters he can muster, a God unto himself, without peer review.  And in this case, the pride of this power has led the author into a descent into true evil.  It may help some to hear the perspective of a lifelong atheist.  I was never indoctrinated into a religion.  This does not mean I was not exposed to other misguided notions, but I suspect this is an important area to be spared because nowhere else is one expected to and practically required to accept and wholeheartedly swallow broadly unsubstantiated material.  I found Peck's arguments to be well thought-out up to a point, which as other reviewers have noted is about halfway through the book.  He argues quite convincingly that people who desire mental health must be dedicated to the truth, and that means not accepting religious dogma.  Further, I agree completely with him that people should not settle for hand-me-down religions but should pursue a personal path to spiritual growth.  Recognizing that the subconscious is the largely hidden reserve of wisdom and the seat of what religions take for God, I expected him to proceed down the objective course he had set out.  I'm sure you will not be surprised that I was very dismayed to hear that did not free him from unsubstantiated dogma after all.    Before going further into the book, let me point out that I am a tolerant but "hard core" atheist.  An atheist forms his ideas from his observations, not from his imagination.  Since gods are suppositions without evidence, they have no place in rational thinking about the world as we know it.  Note that an atheist doesn't "believe" that there is no god; an atheist doesn't exactly "believe" anything.  "Certain" knowledge includes only that which is defined to be true or follows from such definitions, e.g. mathematics.  Everthing else is based on scientfic hypotheses, which are neither true nor false but apply with a certain degree of accuracy to the known world.  Note that the term agnostic, meant to mean an atheist who holds that it can't be be known whether gods exist or not, is rather pointless, as nothing about the real world can be known to be true or false - everything, as I mentioned, is merely hypothetical.  Now we get to the hard core part.  Many atheists are unconcerned with what beliefs religious people occupy themselves with.  I, on the other hand, agree with Peck that religion is a psychopathology and should be treated.  (It is rather blatantly ironic and pitiful on the face of it that after proving this rather eloquently Peck reveals that he himself has been swept up by religious delusions).  The belief in dogmatic phenomena like gods and further, the belief that said belief must be held without question as a point of faith, is potentially quite a dangerous state of mind that can lead to harmful life decisions.  While we can't prove the truth of scientific hypotheses, we can disprove them.  It is an historical fact both of the literature and from every experience of our daily lives that there is no known example of a supernatural phenomena, i.e. one that has disproven natural laws.  It is only at the point where a reason arises to doubt our understanding of the natural world that the reason arises to suppose supernatural causes.  I am a tolerant atheist in that, while I believe religion should be treated, I recognize that no effective treatment exists and so I reluctantly tolerate it even among my closest associates.  This is because I recognize that religion is an attempt, albeit usually based on flighty principles, to get in touch with our true, deeper selves, our "spiritual" side, the vast unconscious swath of human existence that science has not yet touched on but still remains the greater part of our real existence, since our brains are the only reality we really know; our knowledge of the world around us is second hand through our brains.  Without going into great detail, let me just say that Peck descends into a morass of dogmatic views about God, propped up by such bizarre items as unlikely coincidences and how evolution goes against entropy.  Serendipity is a chance happening and not proof of God's existence.  That said, if belief in an unseen helper is the only way you can maintain a positive attitude toward life, then it is a psychopathology that may prove more helpful than harmful.  Still, you would better off seeing the world for what it is and still keeping the positive attitude.  It is true, though, that science and objectivity themselves have not offered up any reason for people to maintain a positive attitude; in fact on the surface it does just the opposite.  For atheists to compete with religions for adherents we must come up with a better way of explaining to people why one can be more exuberant getting closer to the truth than one can to imaginary friends.  Peck's explanation of entropy provides a good example of what kind of bad life decisions a belief in unsubstantiated dogma can lead to.  Apparently a preexisting belief in God (which I hesitate to point out is a term which none of the religions can or could define, which leaves it meaningless) led Peck to misunderstand entropy as something that must increase locally as well as globally, leading him to the conclusion that evolution goes against nature.  It can be easily demonstrated by any first year chemistry student that the injection of energy into a system can do a lot to decrease entropy locally.  This demonstrates that Peck's religious delusions compromised his whole understanding of science.  Having an unsound worldview while you are being educated is dangerous because it can lead to your missing large chunks of your education, leading you to go on to publish falsehoods and spread your misinformation to a wide audience.  I had to award some negative stars for this lack of responsibility.  His analysis of "evil" may make a preacher proud, but from a scientific standpoint it is not only wildly speculative but just plain wrong for a psychoanalyst to adopt.  Evil implies full conscious volition, and the truth, as he is more or less willing to admit, is that evil people have gone down a path where they have surrendered adequate conscious controls, so it is really just pathetic that he uses the word at all.  Sadly, I can't report that Peck came to his senses; he descended deeper into this untenable topic of evil in his book "People of the Lie".  Groan.  The truth is, as any kindergartner knows, that evil is not a kind of laziness as Peck affirms, but willful misdirection through sophistry.  He doesn't just do it with the definition of evil, he does it whenever he redefines a common term.  Love is *not* as love does, as he states.  "Falling in love" is not a biological trap, with true love being the follow through of actions that comes later.  This misdirection, while useful as a platform for sermonizing about commitment and discipline, is patently untrue as anyone who has ever felt feelings of love knows.  The feeling of love is often and even usually not accompanied by appropriate follow through.  Sure, those who wish to be happy and mentally healthy should follow through, but often people in love hurt each other through neglect or even direct abuse.  The actual love is always the "in love" sensation which Peck wishes to misdirect us away from.  Without that, no amount of follow through will do any good.  Is "falling in love" a biological trick?  Dr. Peck, I would hope you would have the grace to recognize it for the ultimate gift of nature that it is and not disparage it.  Satan himself could not have drawn us off the mark more skillfully.  Doctor, heal thyself.  I must say, if ever a person showed the promise, the capacity and the inclination to get past a misguided worldview, this is the person.  Sadly, I say this tongue-in-cheek.  It is well known that those in the grip of religious pathology can rarely break free, even if they can talk about it.  I liken it to an extreme Stockholm Syndrome effect.  If you take a child hostage, what chance does he have?    Adopting a "personal" religion won't serve you better than a second-hand religion so long as it is based on unsupported suppostions as well.  Those who would really take Peck's advice to heart will truly dispense with all religious notions they have heard from others and base their worldview on what they themselves have observed.  My parents were kind enough to leave me to my own devices and it has worked very well for me.  "Grace" is not coming to an accommodation with "God", it is coming to an accommodation with yourself.  It is the sense of peace and enlightenment that washes over you as you get in touch with your larger subconscious mind in various ways.  If you want a book that puts this beautifully, practically and without overt religious overtones, read "Gift of the Sea" by Anne Morrow Lindbergh. 
 I have a theory: Steven Saylor has an identical, yet evil, twin brother named "Spike." I've come to this conclusion after reading the first four chapters of his most recent novel (actually, it's more a collection of inter-related short stories than a novel).  You see the Steven Saylor that we've all come to love wrote the excellent Roma Sub Rosa series. I've purchased and read every book in the series (in fact, I've read them all twice). But after reading the first four chapters of Roma I'm absolutely convinced that Spike Saylor, masquerading as Steven, approached St. Martin's Press and was able to publish this dreck under his brother's name.  I'm astounded at how truly awful this book is: the characters are two-dimensional; they have height and width but no depth whatsoever. The dialogue is embarrassingly bad. While reading this on the subway (in NYC) I found myself physically flinching and had to put the book away in my backpack. I preferred to read the subway adverts instead -- they were more engaging.  If I had Steven's phone number or e-mail address I'd inform him that Spike  has escaped from the asylum and that the police should be notified immediately to stop him from sullying his reputation any further.  MY RECOMMENDATION: skip this turkey 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 I loved What The Bleep? And I specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day'.  This video teaches NOTHING about how to create your day - NOTHING.  It's just Ramtha (JZ Knight) talking about the fact that you can create your day.  I HEARD YOU IN THE MOVIE!  I bought this to give me some additional insights into HOW to create my day.  It does NOT teach any HOW whatsoever.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!  Buy "The Secret" @ TheSecret.tv.  Buy "The Attractor Factor" by Joe Vitale.  Buy "Wealth Beyond Reason" by Bob Doyle.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO 
 Although Vestal establishes his credibility as a researcher, it is not enough to research well; one must also be a writer, and Vestal's embarrassing attempts to mimic Bridger's speech is a travesty.  From inane, trite cliches to ungrammatical and unmusical diction, it is clear that Vestal needed a much stronger editor.  Recommended only for those who can ignore the non-standard grammar and abyssmal writing or who are interested only in the research 
 At 32 pages you really do get what you pay for.  Minimal info on only common herbs, precious little indoor growing information, and certainly nothing that you can't find easily on the web 
 Several weeks have passed, and still waiting for Amazon to ship the book that was listed as in stock and availabl 
 Not really sure if this is a good workout or not.  Be carefull when buying this DVD.  I bought this DVD twice from Amazon and both times instead of sending me Sculpt & Tone, which I ordered and in which my invoice specifically stated, they sent me Step & Tone.  I have now placed my order for Sculpt & Tone from Gilad's official website.  I paid a little bit more, but I am sure they will get the order right.  I usually have good service with Amazon but with buying this DVD the service has been poor.  I am still hopeful though that this will be a great workout.  I know the other DVD's I have of his, Step Aerobics, The New Best of Bodies In Motion, and Step & Tone are all awesome!  D    
 I agree with one of the reviewers who pointed out the anti-social nature of the author. I also agree that the author's self "selling points" are simply a modern copy of the "emperor's new clothes".   I noticed that majority of the posters claimed that this "master's text" is incomprehensible. As a matter of fact, I believe that the entire book are just the psychotic rambling. So why bother even to read it!?  
 Second class book , nothing special  he has a chapter on options ,but without candlesticks , 16 pages of emptiness .The writer tries to fill the page , most of the time he didnt succed it . In fact he promotes his internet site , he needs more customers probably , forget it and go for something more useful. I have an experience of 17 years on candlesticks ,compare all other books with this one and be honest with ur self  
 This movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting.  I found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying 
 I enjoyed "Stoner and Spaz" so when I saw another by the same author, I thought I'd give it a try. "The Brimstone Journals" does have a good premise-that's what made me pick it up. But I felt there were just too many voices involved. Some of the minor characters had two, maybe three poems. That didn't seem enough to fully develop the character. All it did was give you a stereo type. As I was reading, I would just think, "yeah, that's the anorexic, that's the goody-goody..." That's how I was able to keep track of who was who. I thought the "Brimstone Journals" was a good story, but just needed to be longer, the characters more developed, to be truly enjoyed 
 Wholly unappetizing, to put it in cookbook terms.  Thematically ripped off from Dobie Gillis, but without a whiff of the charm and interest of the original.  You really don't care about any of the "characters" introduced in this book.  Stale ingredients make for a bland dish.    
 I had to order this book for a class...I bought it only because of the class. It has chap binding. I've only opened it 5 or 6 times to look up definitions for my class. The binding is alreayd falling apart. 
 This is one of the worst written books I've had the displeasure of reading.  I can spare you the misery.  Companies recover from slumping quarters and dissapointing returns by increasing their communication, co-operation and collaboration.  That's the entire book in one sentence.  The hubris that wreaks from this book is denser than the arrogance it oozes on each page.  The text suffers from redundancy to the millionth degree, by the way.  I vote less than one star, however Amazon forces a one star minimum 
 This book should be title "in the mist of opium", Swain admitted that alot of his writting was done during the drug induced moments,  including his report of American bombing of Kampuchea. What is not cover  here is how Swain convinietly ignore the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge and  his portrait of them as "valiant" fighter against a corrupt  Western-backed regime. Swain like many of his fellow  "journalists" at that time, was siken of the war and tries to  actively end the war by painting a bleak picture about the non-communist  and glorified the Marxist forces. Unfortunately the death of over 600,000  Vietnamese Boat People (as estimated by the UNHCR, 250,000 Vietnamese  "Corrective Labor Reeducation" slaves and several millions Khmers  prove that sometimes "Peace at Any Price" is worst than war, if  the evil side wins 
 I am a fan of Feehan but on this latest book I haven't even finished it yet. Between the sex and the violence it went beyond a little thrilling to just trash. I really hope the next one is better because I had looked foward to the next book in the series and was severely dissapointed.                                                Denis 
 First, let me say that I learned to read from this book. When I was a kid I knew all the words and I loved it! But then again, I didn't know any better, and frankly, neither did my mom and dad. I was lucky in that the book applied to me: I looked like my mom and dad and therefore the message of the book, that your mother is the one who looks most like you, was seemingly harmless.  Now, however, I have an adopted son and am friends with many other families created through adoption, including lots of families with children of different races. The message of this book is really inappropriate for those families and even though my adopted son happens to be physically similar to me, it's not a message I want him to hear, either. Families don't have to look alike to be family!   One of the earlier comments mentions A Mother for Choco by Keiko Kaska and I think this is a MUCH BETTER book than Are You My Mother for ANY child, not just a child in an adoptive or transracial family. The message of that book is that your mother is the one who mothers you...not necessarily the one who looks just like you 
 After reading this I find it hard to believe the WTC steel was turned to dust. WTC "Dustified" by a beam weapon?  I ran the numbers to vaporize most of the steel in the WTC.  No one has created the energy source yet to be used in a controlled weapon, and there was no mention of what would power such a weapon.  Not any real evidence to support the claims.  
 It would be most gratifying to witness the wise and ancient "Ramtha" answering questions posed by credentialled experts in anthropology, archaeology, and other legitimate scientific fields...after all, "Ramtha" would be a font of valuable information about the location of Atlantis and customs, technology and mores of the world 35,000 years ago...things that could be verified in the field, right? Experts in these fields do know quite a bit about agriculture, clothing, tools, and other aspects of life 35 millenia ago--what a chance for "Ramtha" to contribute to our knowledge!  OR--better yet--why not let "Ramtha" take the "Million Dollar" challenge by the James Randi Educational Foundation? Surely "Ramtha" could breeze through that for all the world to see? Otherwise, one is inclined to believe that anybody could master a little stage training, alter their accent, spout vapid platitudes, and make a fortune off of "channeling"...Hey, maybe I should give "channeling" a try!   
  While Bumble and Bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products, this conditioner (and I might add shampoo by the same name) was a real disappointment.   Using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there wasn't even a pleasant scent. Don't know where Bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one. I'm saving my $$$$$ for Lush and Frederic Fekkai!         - Gail Cook 
 I bought and downloaded the eBook of this famous book for my research. It is NOT usable. Most of the text is missing. I have never seen such a bad scanning result. Unbelievable. 
 I ordered "Elvis - 30 #1 Hits" and this CD was fine. Along with that order, I ordered "Elvis 2nd to None".    The CD case was damaged, and the actual CD contained songs in it that were damaged...  Unfortunately it was a gift that I gave someone in another state, which makes it too complicated to return.. 
 Pure trash. Save your time and money. It does not belong in the catagory with "Cezanne in Provence" 
 Thay is a wonderful Dharma teacher, of course, but he reads classical texts through his own philosophy and tries to hide any reference to our self nature, the very key of Zen.  In his commentary on _The Diamond That Cuts Through Illusion Sutra_, he is limited by his own approach. You can better read Ven. Master Hanshan's commentary, what a difference! This is not a Thay's worthy work. He can do it much better, only if he forgets his own philosophy for a second 
 Like a drag queen,this movie is melodramatic,wears too much make-up&is over-the-top.Watching this movie before going to work at 4 in the morning,I found this a hoot.(If this movie were in theaters,people would be in tears---from laughing so hard!!)  One of the gems is when Dolly's controlling boyfriend drawls,"A man is supposed to go after the younger ones,not the woooman!" Put on a fake Texas accent&it works.  There's the Sappy Sequence in which Dolly meets with her mother,looks at photographs of herself,then gets a heart-to-heart with her pastor.Awwwwww...Did Thomas Kinkade ever get directing credits?  Of course,one must suspend disbelief when the Handsome Young Guitarist falls for Dolly.For someone somewhere,they're an archetypal couple.I haven't found that someone.The movie has a hilarious love triange,enough melodrama for 10 Lifetime films--and songs to tie in with the plot,no less!It's country-fried soap opera!Come 'an get it 
 I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations 
 Sorry,  I must have read a really GOOD book before I started this one...I could not finish it.  I made it to just beyond the wedding and I just could not make myself complete it.  It may have just been a matter of bad timing for me... I don't know.  I liked the characters, David, much more than Chritiania, but I just was not that interested in the intrigue.  I guess it was not intriguing enough.  Maybe if it had some humor in it I could have stayed interested...?   The love scenes were a little flat for me.  I switched to a Gaelen Foley book instead and could not put it down for the first 150 pages....It is much more exciting and passionate and intriguing, and they haven't even had sex yet!  Get the Hunter book if you want a bland romance in a historical setting, not too exciting to get your self worked up about.  Sorry, I really wanted to like it, and it is not like me to leave abook unfinished.  I will give her another try with another title...regards & good reading.    
 I have never written a review here before but I just had to say something here to offset the groupie like mentality that i see littered amongst these reviews.  This book was just boring.  Plain and simple.  And when it wasnt boring it was rife with such self absorbtion that I couldnt help but roll my eyes.  I myself make a living as a writer, and as most writers will tell you, the ability to get out of one's own way is key.  But there is such ego here, I wonder how she has the audacity to teach others how to access thier own inner vat of creativity.  It seems as though she just applied the twelve step program to her writing process.  Which is just weird and wrong.  Writing isnt life or death, its just a thing you do, and if you happen to be gifted, then you might be able to turn it into your day job.  If you make it into this grandiose thing, as julia cameron does, then you run the risk of alienating the very people you are trying to reach.    All this author seems to do is whine and move and break down.  She writes all of these things, and moves so many times, I not only got confused but became indifferent to her projects.  I cant say I agree with her whole, let god take care of the quality and I'll worry about the quantity theroy.  It was dizzying.  I never felt connected to her from reading this memoir, probably because she is the least focused person I have ever tried to relate to on the page.  And I couldnt help but wonder what would happen if she poured as much energy into being a mother, or lover or friend as she did on being a "writer" she wouldnt find the peace of mind that so alludes her. 
 Chicago's love song CD is not worth buying. Phillip Bailey who sang "If you leave me now" destroyed this song. I was so disappointed. The only reason I bought it was because it was the only one Wal-Mart of Pikeville, Kentucky had in the store. It sucks 
 Big and Jay-Z It wouldnt be any stars because that song is hot but the other radio played tracks are good but not great dont let the hype fool you dont buy 
 Nothing can prepare you for this work. No one in the history of literature has written with more pretentiousness and self-indulgence. How Pessoa can present himself as both pathetic and heroic at the same time is a miracle of narcissism. In contemporary terms this is like an adolescent blog. He dismally attempts to disguise his platitudes as lyrical profundity 
 it was ok but could have been alot better.  it seemed to lag at places and they could have done things a bit more creepy but alas it didn't happen..........a reporter finds out she is pregnant and goes online to find a womens clinic to see about an abortion since her news anchor boyfriend doesn't want the baby since it would be damaging to his career.  while searching online she comes across one and clicks on the site then goes in for a visit and the movie is suppose to take off from there but it doesn't.  it basically turns out she is still pregnant which causes problems at work and with her boyfriend.  she teams up with a detective who finally tells her she will die in 15 days from clicking on the website for the women clinic and they start investigating the clinic and the apartment of the previous victim.  the end was rather lame as she gives pseudo birth when her boyfriend admits he forced his prevoius girlfreind to have an abortion. so unless you are really desperate for something to watch and can pick this up for a dollar and want to kill a bit of time i would not recommend watching this although it is better than some of the stinkers i have come across lately 
 This book is merely a hundred something pages long and yet 99% of what the two authors said are in defense of the traditional church doctrine. The only credit they gave Dan Brown is the fact that he stirs up the debates reguarding Mary Magdelene. That's it. The rest are just praises of how the church's version of the history makes better sense, has more morality and is more ethically-oriented. They completely dismissed any Gnostic ideas. You don't need to waste a few dollars on this book when you can attend the church for free and have the pastor tell you the same things 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 The 2.0 GB SanDisk Cruzer Micro flash drive looked like a good deal when I saw it on display at Office Depot.  It was roomy enough for all of my data and configuration files, was rated for USB 2.0, and was reasonably priced.  My first choice would have been an larger version of the 1.0 GB Iomega I use at work, but, alas, such wasn't available.  Unfortunately, I waited too long to put the SanDisk through its paces, or I would have tried to get a refund.  As many others have remarked, it is horribly slow.  While backing up my roughly 10,000 files, I found that it was taking about a second per file -- longer for the big ones.  This translated to around four hours to complete the whole operation.  Bulk deletes take just as long to carry out.  Using my Beyond Compare file synchronization software to *read* the SanDisk and compare its contents to what was on my hard drive went reasonably fast -- until, for no obvious reason, it hung on one particular Word document this evening.  I couldn't even get my Windows XP machine to shut down without yanking the SanDisk from its slot:  the usual "safely remove hardware" operation wouldn't work.  After three attempts to read the same file, and three reboots, I tried to delete it from Windows Explorer -- and this operation hung too.  Finally I was able to do the deletion from the DOS prompt.  Just like 1985!  I then recopied the file, and now Beyond Compare can finish its work without a hitch.  But can I trust the SanDisk to deliver up my precious files when I really need them?  I dunno ....  So, it's back to the drawing board.  Maybe by now Iomega has come out with that 2.0 GB model.  As for the SanDisk, I'm reminded of that painful adage:  you get what you pay for.  Ugh 
 Yes, President Bush is a rebel.  He rebels against the people of the United States and the Constitution.  Here are just a few examples of his rebellious ways:  1.   He turned a record surplus into a record deficit.  2.   He cuts benefits to the poor in order to fund obscene tax cuts to the rich.  3.   He manipulated and cherry-picked intelligence data in order to rationalize starting an immoral and unjust war.  4.   He lied to the American people about the reasons for starting that war.  5.   He allowed America's real enemies to escape justice in order to pursue his own selfish and unrealistic goals.  6.   He refuses to acknowledge the reality of the consequences of America's (and the world's) dependence on fossil fuels.  7.   He defies the Constitution of the United States by ordering the illegal spying of Americans and the torture of prisoners who are being held indefinitely without being charged.  Nearly 150 years ago our fore-fathers fought a Civil War to stop the rebels in this country who rejected our Constitution.  Now we have a President in the White House who basks in his rebel status and thumbs his nose at those who dare to challenge him.  Meanwhile, authors like Fred Barnes praise his rebelliousness, and millions of Americans rejoice in their self-proclaimed righteousness because it happens to coincide with their president's, and millions more simply stand passively mute. 
 Though Mr. Steyn does have strong opinions and some good observations, his judgements are tainted by an anti-gay bias (he titles one chapter "The Fags", and it's not meant affectionately).  His readings of stories such as the reaction of Lorenz Hart upon hearing "Oklahoma" in a blackout could have been better informed by further research, and he repeats Lerner's silly comment about Lorenz Hart being to short to be heterosexual so he had to turn to men.  The book is also dated in many respects including the waning influence of British Operettas and the public's acceptance of Stephen Sondheim.  Rather than this book I would reccommend anything by Ethan Mordden or Martin Gottfried 
 I have yet to use an actual phrase from this guide, but... it is good for re-charging my batteries when I have to write a review and feel uninspired.  After reading through some ideas in this guide, I usually find I can then find my own words to say what I need to convey.  The fact that all the phrases are positive, I see as a good thing because I feel it's important to have a positive attitude toward the associate you're reviewing.  If there are challenges in the persons performance, the manager should have been working with the associate on that throughout the review period.  I would recommend this book but only as a way to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own way of phrasing... rather than use the phrases in the book. The people we manage deserve more than "copy/paste" reviews.  
 Interesting tidbits, like any book, but I thought this book was stereotypical japanologist..., and this is the exact type of book japanophiles should steer far, far away from.  I didn't find his explanations for "kata" a reason why japanese culture is the "superior society".  Nor he does he explain "kata" in dilligent detail.  This book really wasn't about japanese bows anyway.  While I don't doubt De Mente has written some good books, I think this book was his attempt at flattering and complimenting japan for cash 
 A very bland pictorial scrapbook of those jet-set ladies from the past.  It could and should have looked much better than this haphazard collection of period company PR photos from the last few decades.  There is no contents page, no captions to the photos or even page numbers to give a buyer any sense that this is any more than a quickie production which I expect will hit the mark-down section of most bookstores faster than the publisher's expected.  Despite this there are a few pages that caught my interest.  Near the back of the book there are twenty or so of those upright timetables that you could pick up from travel shops years ago.  Each has a smilling (naturally) stewardess, a company logo and parts of a jet on the cover.  Another reviewer has mentioned 'Come fly with us!' (ISBN 1933112069) which covers exactly the same subject and predictably has the same sort of soft focus posed company photos but at least it has a lot more editorial flair and an imaginative design (even though its published by Collectors Press).  Stewardesses by the nature of their job are likely to be seen in most books about airlines and these two offer an interesting pictorial overview of flying: 'Airline design' (ISBN 3832790551) and 'Airline: identity, design and culture' (ISBN 3823854607).  I prefer this last book to the others mentioned.  ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover. 
 "Simians, Cyborgs, and Women" sounds as if it might be interesting to discuss the connections between the three conceps upon first glance.  Feel free to read the opening portions of the book.  They are representative of the majority of the book.  If you are well-versed in fanatical feminist theories - and, more importantly, agree wholeheartedly with them - then you will enjoy the book immensely.  On the other hand, if you are expecting a healthy discussion of the basis of, rationale for, and definitions of feminist theories, look elsewhere.  The book is rife with shakey feminist theories which serve as premises to even still more outrageous conclusions, without any attempt to justify the premises themselves.  As a result, it ends up a house of cards, without a strong foundation, puffed up far more than it ever should.  I would have been more interested in seeing a well-structured analysis of the views underlying the arguments she makes.  Alas, a search for such an analysis was in vain 
 I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; "Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular"   
 This was my last attempt at buying a battery operated frother. My hope was that it would recharge after every use and being environmentally consciencious would put my mind at ease. Well, the recharging base is not "smart" so you have to drain out the # of uses before putting it back on the base. The battery has memory so if by accident you put it back on the base, the life span of the battery is shortened.  The most important message is this: Even a fully charged battery was not powerful enough to make an enjoyable drink--The kind of drink you can't wait to get home to make. I'm reverting back to the manual style of frothing 
 I was looking forward to reading this but was not able to finish the book. There is no hint of objectivity in this work. The sole purpose seems to be to praise blacks. Toward that end the book is a stream of quotes that have only one thing in common--they say something positive about blacks. There is little attempt to analyze or coordinate these quotes. Quotes will be taken from authors who disagree with many of Jackson's theories but that doesn't bother him as long as the quote meets his immediate needs. It appears that he'll use any quote from any source without attempt at analysis if it meets his limited objectives.  Jackson inserts his own unexamined opinions often without any attempt at analysis. Any work based solely an attempt to promote one race is doomed to failure and this is no exception 
 most boring of the barbie movies, i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over. and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever. and i agree with another reviewer, princess and the pauper and rapunzel, much better!!! 
 I hope Cornwell gets professional help for whatever motivated him to author this.  Rychlak's book "Hitler, the War, and the Pope" needs to be read if you choose to read this one.  Law professor historian Ron Rychlak(nonCatholic) has shown proof author Cornwell was biased and telling lies, starting from the front cover of "Hitler's Pope".    That cover picture story is interesting and demonstrative of Cornwell's penchant for manipulative tactics to get the result he wanted.  The building in the cover photo is the office of both the Weimar government and later Hitler.  Go to the UK Amazon site and notice that the cover photo for the same book is different than the cover on the American Amazon site.  They both naturally were the same(they both were the UK cover) when the book was originally published, but the surprise phone call by Rychlak to an American radio show Cornwell was on, not only forced Cornwell to then alter the photo, but change the inset text that described the photo.  But Cornwell still apparently couldn't help himself, he still was manipulative, so instead of eliminating the photo he carefully eliminated the parts of the photo and blurred the other parts that proved it was not a visit to Hitler, but to the Weimar government - Hitler's rivals before he took power.  Cornwell was further forced to reprint the book and change the text inside the book falsely claiming that the picture was taken after Hitler gained power.    Some of Cornwell's misrepresentations and falsifications were exposed after Rychlak published his analysis of Cornwell's facts, so I suggest reading what Rychlak has published on the web in addition to reading Rychlak's book.  
 This book has its good points. If anything, it helps you put into words what you want  from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. The online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. This messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.  As for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees, I'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. The company I work for has done this, and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.  Your money can be spent better elsewhere. I say its only worth about $10 
 Very basic information at best. Not really much help if you are seriously thinking of growing your own grapes. Many questions, like what variety should I grow, in not addressed properly as far as a Merlot or Cabernet etc. In fact the word "Merlot" is not even in the book! How far apart should the vines be planted? Beats me! I guess I'll have to look in another book. 
 A proper assortment of vacuities, false academisms, and funny logic (e.g., you are offered a choice of direct (sic) advertising, which simply states the advantages of a product, or "an interesting creative idea", thus suggesting that these two notions are incompatible.) It goes without saying, that the book (like all ivory-tower books, Cannes, etc.) mostly talks about Coca-Cola and other products that could fare perfectly all right with just some reminding advertising. No murmur of launch ads, high technologies, cross-cultural marketing and other "dangerous" topics. Perfect reading for insomnia cases 
 I found this paper on Amazon as an accessory to the Olympus Camedia P-400 Printer.  This paper does NOT fit the P-400 because this paper is TOO wide.  Thus, with the P-400, this paper is useless 
 Joe needs to stick to high energy rock.  Except for "Chain of Fools", this album is all elevator music in a gravel pit.  Get the "Ultimate Collection" instead 
 This book's "scientifically proven" findings made me think it would contain something really life-changing or unheard-of. On the contrary, the book's advice couldn't be more cliched.  Niven never says anything of real depth or quality. You don't learn. Each chapter is too short. As a result, the topics are way underdeveloped. Another problem: some chapter titles just don't relate to the content that follows. One that stands out especially is, "Turn off the TV." So turning off the television is REALLY going to make me happier?! Niven's point might be that doing so translates to quality time spent with family, friends, or simply oneself, but why target just TV? When I read the title, I anticipated reading about studies showing that TV viewing leads to increased incidence of depression, but no, that's not it at all. The chapter really has nothing to do with TV. Other chapters are similarly problematic.  A far better book--MUCH better--is "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff," by Richard Carlson, a book that truly changed my outlook and approach to everyday problems, and for me that's saying A LOT. That book makes you think and constantly presents a perspective the reader might never have considered. 
 I bought this toaster to replace my cheap $10 Toastmaster, which held up for more than 10 years [it was still working when I tossed it in favor of this name-brand toaster].  The sliding shelf that holds the bread in place is made of a very thin, soft and flimsy steel.  After only 2 years of use, the shelf became bent and no longer remained attached to the sliding mechanism; and it could not be fixed.  The shelf is hooked onto the slider by 2 small prongs that ultimately broke off.  I am surprised that KitchenAid would sell a piece of junk like this 
 An awful lot of people are making an awful lot of money dishing out what amounts to either common sense or drivel. Here the author requires almost 300 pages to state what could have been said in 5 to 10.  If this is an example of what passes for substantive executive training than heaven help us.  Borrow the book from a library if you must, skim a couple of the pages and you'll have all of it.  Don't waste your money 
 Do you have any that I can study on 
 The bra is advertised as 100% cotton, there's only 33% cotton in it, it is not soft whatsoever, you can feel it.  And the fit is all wrong. Completely useless, I'm returning it and very mad at the misleading name "Cotton... " bra 
 I give this book one star as there was nothing lower to choose from.  Save your money.  This book is not worth either your time or your money.  Was she on drugs during the writing of this piece of tripe?  
 Kristanna Loken (I thought she was great in Terminator III) plays Rayne who is half human/half vampire.  Her father was a vampire and her mortal mother was killed by him.  Of course, she saw the murder as a child.  When she is an adult and escapes from a carnival, she seeks some eye and to kill the vampire that killed her mother.  She does succeed in the end at doing so, and of course, the story is filled in by fight scenes, training for fighting, jealousy and even some betrayal.  I must say this movie was not quite that good.  It seems like the attention was mostly on placement of where the blades slashed the bodies during the fight scenes.  There are actors in this movie that are readily recognizable, and I figured with the people they had, it would be great to watch.  But unfortunately I felt I wasted my time.    Overall, I did not like the movie at all 
 I bought this card because I had heard it works well with linux. Well I didn't get that far with card because when it arrived it was DOA and doesn't work at all. So now I have to either pay shipping to send it back to amazon or contact dlink and try to get them to send me a replacement : 
 Never has the title of a book more aptly described the content within. This tome is nothing more than the recounting of incidents in the life of a group of marginally intelligent and emotionally challenged individuals who, when faced with choices, inevitably choose the one designed to create the most disasterous results. Over and over and over again. If you are looking for happiness in the recounting of a good tale look elswhere on the bookshelf. 
 Born Confused follows the life of the culture-confused main character, Dimple Lala.  Now I have to say, I know little about Indian cultures, but it seemed to me that Dimple didn't know so much herself. I do have experience with parents, of course, so her parents' reaction when she came home drunk was entirely unrealistic. My huge complaint is that the author portrays getting drunk and stoned as hilarious. The entire story, Dimple keeps saying how she never does anything wrong, but when her best friend says to drink or smoke marijuana she immediately does so, without question. God forbid if she had been told to do anything worse. Please, do not teach teens that smoking grass is a good thing. Is this author out of her mind???  Then, there was the friend, Gwynn, who was no friend at all. She was probably one of the most selfish characters I have ever come across, ex: taking her friend's clothes without asking, divulging her deepest secrets to a total stranger, who just so happens to be the boy she is after while her friend, Dimple, is sitting right there, she throws her best friend aside as soon as she gets a boyfriend, and when the time comes to apologize, she lays it all on Dimple's shoulders. If I had a friend like her I wouldn't stand that kind of treatment, but Dimple did. Even when she confronted Gwynn, nothing seemed to come of it, in my opinion. Dimple was a major pushover, and the ending, although everything is magically resolved in one year in the story, would not be in real life. Dimple was a kind, sympathetic character. She deserved a better friend and a backbone. Also, the author sometimes got carried away with descriptions...  At the moment, I'm having trouble remembering any good points. I think I liked it somewhat at the time I was reading it, but that feeling has left me completely.  Overall: another over-hyped book.  
 This book is so general  that even someone who has never fished would know more already. Some of the information is inaccurate and/or not up to date. The auther has not been even been fishing for what I think is a long time.  He even admits to getting a lot of his info from guides and charters. In fact he talks a lot about all the fish he has cought on the charters and trips he's been on. Anyone can catch fish on a charter. I hope the For Dummies book are not going to all be like this from now on because they are normally very good 
 When Susan Faludi published BACKLASH in 1991, one of her chapters was devoted to the regressive representations of women in TV and film. There was even the hint of resignation that this was not a temporary blip, but perhaps a permanent or long term situation. Luckily and in part thanks to Faludi calling attention to the backlash, instead we saw in popular culture an explosion of images of strong women. In TV alone we have seen the emergence of such characters as Dana Scully, Xena, Buffy Summers, Aeryn Sun, Sydney Bristow, Max Guevera, Kathryn Janeway, and Veronica Mars, not to mention those Gilmore girls. Even shows not specifically centered on strong women have them as a matter of course, such as Kate Austen on LOST or Samantha Carter on STARGATE SG-1. Indeed, a chasm seems to separate our situation and Faludi's in 1991.   Given the richness of the subject, it is simply shocking how weak this collection of essays is. All anthologies are uneven, but this one contains a higher proportion of weak or simply awful essays than most. I don't have a confident explanation for why these essays are on the whole so weak, though they do share some common characteristics. Let me highlight a couple of these. I do want to add, however, that there are a couple of very good essays, in particular Renny Christopher's marvelously insightful essay on Aeryn Sun in FARSCAPE as well as the essay by the volume's editor on female action figures. But most of the essays are deeply flawed. Let me explain my problems with them.   One very obvious problem with several of the essays is that they either misread the shows that they discuss or almost intentionally misrepresent their content. For instance, one essay guilty of this is Sharon Ross's essay about female friendship in BUFFY and XENA. Most of what she says is unquestionably true about XENA and if the essay had been merely about that show would have been one of the stronger additions to the collection. But it is a terrible reading of BUFFY. She reads BUFFY as largely concerned with the kind of discussion and reevaluation of matters that she views as uniquely true of female friendship. If you read the essay without having seen the show, you would imagine that Willow was nearly the co-lead character of the show, instead of a member of an ensemble cast. In point of fact, BUFFY is most decidedly not a show about female friendship. In fact, excluding Willow, Buffy is actually more heterosocial in her relationships. In fact, Willow aside, Buffy relates more easily to men than to women. Apart from Willow, all her closest friends and confidantes are men, including Giles, Xander, Angel, and Spike. Her relations with women are almost always uneasy and conflicted, including her mother, Faith, Dawn, Cordelia, and Anya. Moreover, even including Willow there is never a point in the series where she primarily or exclusively goes to Willow for advice instead of Xander or Giles. To read BUFFY as primarily as a show about female friendship is a travesty. Ross also states that the show is at its "most effective when" it "offer[s] stories of the primary female friends resisting men's attempts to keep them apart." She then cites several shows as examples, including "I Robot, You Jane," "The 'I' in Team," and "Yoko."  These are not bad episodes, but they are far, far from the show at its most effective and none would make any reasonable list of, say, the top twenty-five or thirty episodes of the show's 144.  In other words, only by distorting BUFFY to a remarkable and untenable degree can it be made to be a show about female friendship.  There is no question that there is a strong female friendship as one of many major constituent parts of the show, but it is hardly privileged in the way that Ross states.    Another example is Sara Crosby's essay on three supposed instances of suicidal self-sacrifice among TV action heroines due to the forceful suppression of strong female heroes by structures of patriarchy:  Max at the end of Season One of DARK ANGEL, Buffy at the end of Season Five of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and Xena in her show's series finale.  I won't argue with the Xena part, because that is fairly accurate, but the characterization of Max and Buffy's deaths is utterly baffling.  First, Crosby characterizes Max's death as a suicide, which is absurd, unless being shot by one's clone, over which one maintains utterly no control and therefore no agency, counts as a suicide.  Agency and not similar DNA (and the DNA is only similar and not exact, since one of the themes of the show in Season Two--and it would have been THE theme of Season Three had it not been canceled--was Max's genetic uniqueness, which would have enabled her to save the world from annihilation) is acknowledged in every day language as determinative of suicide.  But Crosby barely hints at the radical departure from normal language use she is making.  It also isn't clear what structures of patriarchy she is talking about in DARK ANGEL.  In fact, Manticore, which is the entity that kills Max, is totalitarian, not patriarchal.  Unless one can generate a convincing essentialist definition of totalitarian as patriarchal this is not at all the same thing.  There is in fact a remarkable disregard for gender at Manticore and one of Max's more striking traits, despite being played by a very beautiful woman, is that she has never been feminized.  We could debate the fact that Jessica Alba is beautiful, but the brute fact of prime time television is that we will never, ever have an unlovely young person playing a lead role in such a show.  Similarly, in talking of Buffy's death at the end of Season Five, it is impossible to identify the structures of patriarchy.  Interestingly she never mentions the fact that the Big Bad of Season Five is a goddess except in passing.  Buffy sacrifices herself to close the hell portal to save her sister and her friends because of some supernatural rules.  Are the rules patriarchal?  If not, it is difficult to see how her death becomes gendered.  In other words, the entire essay is a colossal stretch.  The fundamental problem with these two and several other essays is that the writers do not seem to understand the different from actual society and a television series.  A TV series may reflect society in the way it is conceived, but it does not actually contain that society.  In fact, most of the TV series of the past fifteen years with strong female leads actually imagine a society that is different from the actual one.  In our real society, there truly are systems of patriarchy that repress women and attempt to relegate them in lessened roles.  But that system may not be replicated in a TV series.  In fact, there is a gender utopianism in many of these shows.  If one watches BUFFY or FARSCAPE or VERONICA MARS one will be struck by how rarely the ability of these women to take care of themselves is questioned by the males around them.  As Renny Christopher points out in her brilliant final essay of the volume on FARSCAPE (an essay that alone justifies the purchase price), FARSCAPE is a representation of a world in which patriarchy does not exist.  The Peacekeepers may be ruthless and totalitarian and authoritarian, but he makes no distinctions based on gender.  But what is true of FARSCAPE is largely true of these other shows.  The writers try to make the shows about issues that are really excluded by the show.  Now, one might argue with how realistic the shows are by excluding or minimizing patriarchal structures (they aren't realistic, but that is because they are utopian:  they are trying to show us a world that ought to be, a world in which women are allowed to be as strong as men), but you can't escape the fact that they are fictional worlds.  In BUFFY a man does not react with shock if Buffy kills a demon with her bare hands in front of a male as in "The Prom."  I haven't rewatched all of BUFFY in a year, but the only moment I can recall when someone was shocked that she could do what she did despite being female was the beginning of "The Gift," when a boy she has saved from a vampire asks her how she "did that."  "It's what I do," she replies.  "But you're just a girl."   But even here the point is that an unrealistic burden has been placed upon her, causing her to feel the weight of the world on her shoulders, leading her to answer, "That's what I keep telling myself."  But this is the exception.  Normally no one acts shocked if she clears the Bronze of vampires in "Welcome to the Hellmouth, Pt. 2" or overcomes a large gang of demons in "Anne."    I guess what I'm objecting to is an overall intellectual clumsiness in these essays.  As a grad student I read countless bad essays along the lines of the ones here and I think at least many of them are a result of the "publish or perish" mentality dominating American higher education.  And there is a push if you are in gender studies to take some of the central assumptions and apply them to a wide range of subject matter.  It is as if they strive to understand their discipline first, and then only half-heartedly study that towards which they apply it.  One example of intellectual sloppiness can be found throughout the first essay in the collection, Claudia Herbst's essay on Lara Croft.  Throughout she makes one generalization after another about the actual mental or psychological states of gamers that could only actually be validated by statistical analyses of actual gamers.  A large number of her "proofs" are actually anecdotes from postings on boards on the Internet.  A good example can be found in this passage:  Writing of Lara she says, "Men may interpret her toughness and her tiny waist as sexy.  Many women find her figure disturbing and respond negatively to the nature-defying design of her body.  Perhaps what women are responding to . . . " (p. 35).  These are incredibly loose hinges upon which to build an argument.  "Men may."  Do they are do they not?  And where is the polling data that indicates which.  "Many women find . . . "  Again, how many women, and where is the polling data.  Two very dubious suppositions, but then after constructing these straw men and women she goes on to speculate "Perhaps what women are responding to . . . "  She hasn't established any real women do so respond, let alone that women in general do.  Yet the entire essay is built up on weak links such as that.  Not all the essays are bad.  Though I question whether Sherrie Inness has done a good job as an editor, her introduction and her essay are both good.  Jeffrey Brown's essay on BARB WIRE was interesting, though he hasn't made me want to see it.  Charlene Tung's essay on LA FEMME NIKITA did, however, make me want to give that series a shot.  So also with David Greven's essay on WITCHBLADE (currently unavailable on DVD), though I am suspicious of his depiction of the lead as a lesbian hero (it doesn't quite pass the smell test, though perhaps I am wrong).  Dawn Henecken's essay on Chyna might be OK.  I just have less than no interest in either Chyna or the world of fake wrestling, so it was a tough essay for me to get through.  Marilyn Yaquinto's essay on women in gangster films was fun.  All in all, however, I cannot recommend the collection.  Apart from Renny Christopher's very fine essay, I don't think there is much that one interested in the subject can't live without 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 Thought it would be great, but actually scared my dog and when he got over his fear he was unable to get near enough to play with it. Needless to say he did not get enjoyment out of it. Can't recomend 
 A dilemma suggests two views, a situation where a difficult choice must be made.  The author presents only one view.  Over and over again she tells stories of unhappy adults who were paralyzed by the gifted label and the experience of being pushed by extreme parents.  While I believe these stories and pain are genuine, I cannot understand why Ms. Quart does not speak of other adults who have thrived, those who look back fondly on their gifted education and the enrichments their parents offered. She mentions the current Spelling Bee pronouncer and former champion, Jacques Bailly. In other venues Bailly has frequently spoken how much he believes in academic competition and how much he enjoyed the experience as a child. But here Bailly is only quoted when he registers a complaint.   Stories of positive experiences never are mentioned.  The balance would have made this book live up to the subtitle.  The crucial flaw of the book is that Ms. Quart completely misses the point about gifted children. She speaks of giftedness as something forced on children (or as a classification "bought" by wealthy families.).  Anyone who spends time with a truly gifted child knows that the push comes from the child. No parents of a gifted child would ever credit the Baby Einstein videos for their child's intellectual curiousity.    And gifted children do ask for academic pre-schools and weekly trips to the museum, and very much enjoy spending hours in a small room being quizzed by an adult. (This may not be a good thing, but it is a real thing.)    I expected the book to examine the actual dilemma parents face--how much should the parent nurture the child's requests, and how much should the children be encouraged to "just go out and play"  even though they resist?  By dismissing the key element of the child's desires in this equation, Ms. Quart eliminates any value to her argument.    This book does nothing to help gifted children, nor to guide their parents or teachers. 
 I bought the original LP double album a very long time ago, and was thinking of upgrading to a CD. Then I see the track list...ECM decided to lop off the tunes from Side 3, Gary Burton's solo "I'm Your Pal / Hullo, Bolinas" and Chick Corea's solo of "Love Castle".  The one star rating is for ECM, for not making this a two CD set.  The music that's there is great.

 Though I am not a Vogue reader, I picked up this book out of curiosity to see what Anna W's splashes in the tabloids were all about.  While the subject is only mildly interesting to me, the author's prose reads like a 300+ page deposition against Anna Wintour from everybody who had/has a major or minor gripe with her. It's a heavy and boring read.  Gossip, if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining, should remain light and diverting. In this book, it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author, much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it. I was very happy to put it down.   Perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job. But then again, when that time comes, Anna Wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest 
 As a second generation Irish-American Catholic, I hoped to find a good story wrapped within the unique Irish-American perspective of life.  However, I was very disappointed for the following reasons:  1) the story was too simplistic (and full of tired cliches), 2) the characters were one-dimensional stereotypes and 3) the main characters (and their family) were claustrophobic in their smug superiority.  I have seen too many families that present just this outward image while hiding a truth that would be more beneficial for all to see the light of day.  Isn't it ironic now that the theme of the distorted family image of the O'Sulivan family is in fact duplicated by the depiction of the Coyne/McGrail clan.  Surely I won't be coming back for a second helping

 Thank goodness for Apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year (1-year warrenty) and then die. I would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed $100 dollar iPods.

Then you'll have no choice but to buy NOW 25.If you ever look at NOW 1 you'll knotice how passe it has become. In ten years this cd will be just the same.

 I almost bought this book for my children (ages 1-11) through our school's Scholastic book program but decided to wait and review it here first. I'm glad I did.   Based on Amazon reviews stating displeasure over graphic photos unsuitable for children, I've decided not to buy the book. Moreso, I've contacted our school and recommended they remove it from their shelves and will also be contacting Scholastic to request they remove it from their program.  There is never unlearning something, only relearning. I'm glad this is one area in which I don't have to retrain my kids.   Thanks for reviewing products on Amazon and notating important things like this indecent content. It has made a difference 
 I will preface the review that I believe most of the tenets of "Peak Oil" and related arguments.  I picked up this book after seeing it in a side-bar banner add on a popular peak oil forum.  I was disappointed as soon as I started reading.  my main comments on the book are 1)  The book doesn't offer any new data on the topic, but instead gives a rehash of peak oil along with some alarmist consequences 2)  The book doesn't offer any tenable strategies to survive the author's "power down" scenario.  Kunstler in his book "Long Emergency" gives more meat here (though still not too much). 3)  The author gets sidetracked in a conspiracy theory discussion on Bush, the Iraq war, and various other ills of the military-industrial complex.  Generally I think these types of theories don't add a lot to the discourse, and was annoyed to see "Bush is Bad" references sprinkled throughout.  Bottom line is: not terrible, but not worth $10 
 Dr. Benner notes that 87% of surveyed pastors wished they had more pastoral counseling training, and that they thereby regard themselves as unprepared for counseling circumstances they encounter, despite seminary training and a large number of books published on the subject. This sense of pastoral inadequacy has spurred Benner to write Strategic Pastoral Counseling, which hopes to address the lack of practical pastoral counseling guides by providing busy pastors with a framework or methodology for effective counseling.   While most books can take on an overly theoretical tone, Benner has intended that his book, while theoretically sound, should act as a very practical sourcebook for pastors, providing them with a schema or algorithm for managing their counseling challenges. Benner briefly surveys the history of pastoral counseling, ***although limiting himself to the last century of thought***. This done, he reviews the range of counseling forms offered within the church, from formal discussions with the pastor to simple forms of friendship among church members. He also notes the unique nature of pastoral counseling and the unique but perhaps insufficient qualifications that pastors possess by virtue of their specialized education. Lastly, before detailing his pastoral schema, he reflects on the goal of effective pastoral counseling, spiritual growth in a Christian context.  Benner's methodology, what he describes as "strategic pastoral counseling", is "brief and time-limited, holistic, structured, involves assigned work between sessions, and is church-based, spiritually focused and explicitly Christian." Benner works out each of these characteristics in some detail, and then turns to a practical discussion of how these various qualities can be achieved with a particular conversational methodology, involving "encounter, engagement, and disengagement". Benner helpfully suggests a maximum of 5 visits with counselees to bound the scope of counseling discussions and safeguard the busy pastor's schedule.  Benner concludes his presentation with two representative case studies which illustrate his recommended strategy in practice. These case studies survey the range of pastoral counseling commitments: one a five-week engagement with a very difficult counseling situation, and another single-visit circumstance. In both case studies, he provides representative dialog along with a running commentary on how his strategy is worked out in practice.  Strategic Pastoral Counseling contains a few regrettable references to women pastors, and has few roots in Scriptural observations, but nonetheless provides some useful considerations for pastors or prospective pastors who are wondering how to effectively counsel the members of their spiritual community amidst a busy schedule.   Overall, points subtracted for failing to spring from a historically informed view of the Church and her activities, especially a familiarity with the old post-Reformation pastors of the soul. For example, why is no one asking why pervasive professional "counseling" only appeared relatively recently among us? Are we the best and brightest generation? Were the old guys just dolts? What were they doing with those under their care? Worth some thought, but few are inquiring.. 
 This is a warning.  This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator.  The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted.   There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it.   I learned this the hard way, using it in a class amd now have subjected my students to this particular translation.  It is a wonderful play, but this edition should be taken off the market 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 ok they either have the wrong description or the wrong photo/title. the review is for Invasion of the Boy Snatchers. com'on people!!!XP only 1 star for the idiots at amazon.                                                               
 If you're new to the postmodernism question, then this book isn't for you. Better to start someplace else. And if you been looking at postmodernism for a while now, you've probably already read other, more extensive works by the authors of this volume, so you don't need to read this book either. So basically, there's no good reason to read this book.  And if you were going to read it, you would have a hard time because of the way its laid out design-wise. Being postmodern and all, Zondervan tried to design the inside of this book as "with-it" as they could. Unfortunately, while I enjoy postmodern book covers, when that same style is applied to the insides of a book it can make for some very tedious reading. Much of the text is printed as a light shade of gray using an italic font, which, as any graphic designer reading this review will tell you, is a big no-no. It just makes for hard reading.  Oh, and future editions of this work should edit out Fredica Mathewes-Green's attemps at humorous commentary throughout Horton's piece.  Cheers 
 Amazon's aggressive marketing tacticts now include shipping you goods when you called them to cancel it. I will never buy from Amazon again. I bought over 100 items over 5 years. I purchased the camera on a 1 day delivery plan. They then just ship 4-5 day completely insensitive to a photographer's needs. I cancelled order 2 days before it ships, they say sorry we cannot cancel. 2 days??? come-on. I guess the $3000 just creates nice interest. The end for me and amazon, I do not like this kind of "aggressive marketing".  Good advice, Rather buy direct from B&H Photo, pay double if you like, but you will get what you pay for there, not aggressive marketing and shoving of a product down your throat at their terms. I am truly annoyed. Run, hide. 
 I am also trying to figure out what song was playing in the club... I thought it was "Everything but the Girl" also or "Sade"... I have had no luck.. 
 Not as good as the original but at least it is in color! This was not one of Daryl Hannah's finest moment. Some of the special effects were laughable especially the miniaturization of the city. Over all, the cast wasn't that good. However, if remakes of old classics are your bag this might be for you.  Now we wait for the Wasp Woman to be remade! 
 I went to Swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others.  This is the only pole they have which isn't saying much for the brand, but I found that the suggested retail is $4 lower to what Amazon is selling it for.  Just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price.  Even though Amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap.  Probably too cheap to be any good 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 There was lots of writting in a book that was advertised as new 
 Danielle Steel has done it once again. Written a book that must have taken her all of one day. I was really disappointed after Summer in St. Tropez, but thought after a break from her books I'd try again. Sorry I wasted my time. This book is SO repetitive, same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph. The story line seems to drag on forever. If Steel's goal is to "dumb" her books down for the masses then she has succeeded. This book is written at about an 11-year-old's level. Don't waste your time 
 On the shelf or on line, this trucks shovel appears to lock into position above the rig but it doesnt. It took me nearly 10 minutes to remove strapping anchored to this truck within the packaging. My son spent a minute playing with this truck only to move on to his other toys. Yeah, the shovel portion drags on the floor and will NOT lock into position above the rig. This truck can hardly be moved through the carpet much less in sand. I grew up with Tonka trucks and this was obviously designed by some young suit that was babysat by the television and playstation. If your looking for a durable fun truck for your child, move on as this truck wont get the smile your looking for.   
 I was really disappointed with this book. I did not like the illustrations or story line. My son never had an interest in this one either. With so many great other choices for pop up books, I would recommend thye Chuck Murphy pop up series, those really held my son's interest 
 The Inflammation Cure by Meggs and Svec, and The Inflammation Syndrome by Challem, both appeared in 2003 and both discuss the role of inflammation in the major diseases of our time, and the things that one can do to limit the risk of diseases related to inflammation.  Both books are easy to read.  Which to choose?  According to the prestigious Library Journal, "While Jack Challem's The Inflammation Syndrome covers similar ground [to the Inflammation Cure], his approach leans toward the faddish and sensationalist, while Meggs takes a more levelheaded approach, weaving the latest research on various diseases into a broad picture."  The thing I most prefer about Meggs' book is that it takes a comprehensive approach (including diet) to the things that affect inflammation, rather than spending the whole book just discussing the role of diet as is done in Challem's book.  Challem is a health reporter who writes and publishes The Nutrition Reporter newsletter; it is natural that he would stress diet and its consequences.  But diseases are caused and controlled by much more than our diet.  Meggs is a practicing physician who has a great deal of clinical experience with all aspects of inflammation, and who has woven many real-life cases into the book as illustrations.  So, which book should you buy?  I have little doubt that you will find The Inflammation Cure by Meggs and Svec more informative and much more useful as a reference on your shelf 
 If you have to choose between this book and Thin Tastes Better (by the same author), buy Thin Tastes Better. This book, while it has a few recipes, is mostly a retread of the information in the other book.    Two things were particularly annoying: 1) his insistence that you banish foods you have a problem overeating completely from your life, thereby reinforcing the belief that  the food is in control and not you; and 2) constant mentioning by brand name of "diet" foods that have ingredients and additives that are objectionable to many people looking for healthy food. It would have been better to just mention what you should look for in quality healthy diet fare.  Mentioning brand names also makes the book dated when items go out of production and are no longer available.  Borrow from the library to read, or buy used 
 Has America gone completely mad? A previous reviewer states: "Rod has outdone himself on this one." Huh? Did she really mean that as a compliment? I've come to the conclusion that nobody under sixty years of age in this screwed-up contemporary society, in which mediocrity reigns, has any idea what a great pop vocalist sounds like. The songs included on this travesty of a cd are standards, classics of jazz-pop. Listening to Stewart mangle them with his phlegm-saturated gargling must have Mildred Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, Bobby Darin, Frank Sinatra, etc., turning over in their graves. Stick with the few remaining major leaguers like Tony Bennett and Vic Damone---even in their eighties they sound lightyears better than this sandpaper-voiced human vegetable. Or check out the newer generation of pop-jazz crooners like Michael Buble, Harry Connick, and Peter Cincotti. They are infinitely better singers than this guy. My God! I can't believe that some people truly think this guy has talent! What's next---- Joe Cocker sings Caruso?  
 The timing for the video content is off and doesn't match the music, the music is good and well-played but arranged to the point that whole movements that are originally 10 minutes long are only like 2 minutes in the video and we foud that frustrating since we listen to Beethoven un-arranged regularly. I also noticed that there was a lot of silent time in this particular video or times at which music is played but it isn't anything I've heard that was composed by Beethoven or, well, maybe it was but edited so to be simplified that it was no longer recognizable. My child may be only 6 mos but he recognizes good music when he hears it having been exposed to it from the time he was in the womb and since and this video didn't catch his interest at all. The BE Mozart music is good though so if you're looking for a video with good music do that one or the Wordsmouth...altogether, though, I recommend just buying the c.d.s and not the composer vids 
 You can buy a better product at an all-for-a-dollar store. This is a complete rip-off for naive cat owners. Please don't waste your money! You can do much better with a large bowl. 
 I've been a huge fan of the Isleys for over 30 years, and stuck by them through the early Motown soul and their golden groove-funk period of the 1970s, through to the later stuff right up to the excellent Mission To Please album. But that's when they should have dumped R. Kelly, because it's the last album that had any really decent hook to it. And when you have a blistering guitarist like Ernie Isley, why bury him so far in the mix that his licks sound like they're being played through cotton wool?    R. Kelly's plodding grooves just grind from one indistinguishable track to another, which is pretty much the case on the even more disappointing follow-up to this, Body Kiss. The only track that kicks any ass here is the opener, Move Your Body, which fools you into thinking this might be a return to former glories for our heroes. Sadly, the leaden funk of R. Kelly then comes crashing in like a tidal wave of sludge and we get a whole turgid mess of leaden walking-pace 'grooves' that might sound all right in the background when you're getting it on with the partner of your dreams, but as listening music just gets you all exasperated and reaching for the 3+3 album again.    Come on, Isleys, dump the Kelly glop and get back to what you can do best 
 Bought this book hoping for a comprehensive resource of information on hiring a nanny.  Boy were we disappointed.  As was mentioned in another post - the book is nothing more than a glorified outline, and half of the book is copies of the forms that are on the disk, which forms by the way are in .pdf form and are not even fillable.  
 I was looking for something more detailed on different laws that someone in HR should know.  I felt this book was too broad and the way it was written was a little hard to read.  If you are a business owner trying to get the basic "dos and don'ts" this may work, otherwise I would look elsewhere 
 This toaster worked great for a month. Then the lever stopped working properly and half the time we can't get the slots to stay down at all. I do not recommend this toaster.  The warranty from Cuisinart is useless - we would have to spend our own money to ship it to them and then include $7 for them to ship a replacement or repaired toaster back.

 These pillows were over rated and the description on Amamzon not accurate. We are very disapointed and could have done better and cheaper at Wal Mart 
 the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways 
 I love David Sedaris. I like Strangers with Candy. But this is the worst book I've ever read. All of the characters are exactly the same, and the entire book is a repetition of one joke. Save yourself valuable time and money and stay far, far away from Wigfield 
 This book can be used as a good reference but it does not serve the basic purpose.  This book is an introductory level book so assumption is that most of the readers will be new to Symbian Programming. There is notion in the industry that Symbian is a bit tough to follow, particularly to .NET and Java programmers. One of the main reason for that is Poor documenetation from Symbian. So only reference to learn Symbian is books like these and most of them serves the purpose.   The examples used by the author are very complicated, not because of the rules of programming for symbian but because of the examples chosen by the Author. Here are some eg classes and objects RHerculesSession::CaptureCeryneianHind RHerculesSession::CleanAugeanStables RHerculesSession::SlayStympalianBirds If we can imagie how a program works, then it will be easy to implement( that is the reason why Dietel & Dietel became so famous). If I am a Mathematecian and if I am writing a book on programming doesn't mean the Class examples should be the calculations of most complex equations in Mathematics.  Apart from the examples its a good reference book 
 This toy is awesome FOR 15 minuets! However I think that the age specification for this toy is way wrong. This toy is more for collectors or "Big" boys! You know "look but not touch type" of toy! My son received this for his 5th birthday & he "LOVES" all of his trucks & is VERY careful with the construction toys! The boom or arm of the excavator broke after about 20 minutes of play time & it can no longer lift anything! The rubber tracks do fall off VERY easy as well! We have taken the toy apart & it's a little plastic toothed disc that moves the arm (plastic gear I guess), well it's shattered. The box did not come with a parts list or a place where to get replacement parts. Now I have a sad 5 year old who cannot play with this huge & COSTLY toy! Very dissapointed even though  "REAL" CAT equipment is durable, this "CAT" is not! 
 I was extremely disappointed by this book.  The title and the write-up on the back cover held the promise of a how-to manual to use your brain to its fullest potential.  The book reads like a superficial mish-mash of philosophy and neurology, with almost no back-up to its major claims and statements about human behavior or the development of societies.  At times it sounds like a new age environmentalist screed, noting that poor use of the brain results in the misuse of natural resources.  I was kept waiting until the final pages of the book for the magical how-to promised at the beginning.  The secret formula for better brain use: be a better person, preferably an environmentalist.  The only information of value is Huther's repeated assertion that your brain physiology will adapt to the way you continually use it, and will reinforce this routine way more and more.  This has been said by other's before (see Edward De Bono, Mechanism of Mind) 
 Erskine Caldwell while apparently wrote during a different time, apparently did nothing to promote anything other than stereotypes of the rural south.  I myself am from a small rural town in Arkansas and grew up with stories my grandparents told of their experiences during the great depression.  They were poor and lived by subsistence farming but they were proud and spoke with a sense of accomplishment of their home life.  While their education and opportunities may have been limited it seemed to make them appreciate what they did have later.  I was surprised to find out that Caldwell had actually lived in the South following my reading the book because he didn't seem to have anything pleasant to say about it at all.  All regions of the country do have impoverished persons who have no ambition to improve themselves nor realize the situation that they're in but this I felt was an unfair take on what was not an easy time for anyone in America.    If you like southern literature, I would much more highly recommend a Willie Morris book, Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Ann Burns, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, maybe one of Shelby Foote's works of fiction, or Eudora Welty amongst others.  In those stories, poverty and racism which are issues in the south are evident but portrayed in a more fair and consistent light.  I will admit in closing that I was interested in the story and finished the book fairly quickly but I felt the content was not all that impressive and only served to deepen stereotypes and preordained views that wrongly exist about the South 
 I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read.  I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability.  The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it.  As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting.  I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable.  
 This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time 
 If you want to read one of THE dullest, stuffiest, not to mention stylistically ghastly books in all of art history, please read this one. These writers confuse ambiguity and meanlingless hodgepodge for intelligence 
 The card works as advertised but SanDisk does not send in Mail-in-Rebate. Even though I mailed it in with the UPC Barcode, SanDisk sent me a post card stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcode. How can I resubmit when they already have the barcode?  In my experience with SanDisk, I got rebate back on one of two cards that I submitted - so you get mail-in rebate 50% of the time with SanDisk. I think mail-in-rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies. Don't trust it! 
 I could not help but to watch this film with all of my African American female sensibilities. Despite the proficient acting, cinematography and directing, I found the content highly offensive and trite. Mr. Kinksy claimed to love Shanduri and was willing to do anything to possess her affections. He was put off to find out that Shanduri was married, but not deterred. Shanduri gave him what she believed was an unattainable challenge to have her husband, who was arrested for speaking out against the government, freed from an African prison. I recognize that it is possible for a servant to fall in love with her employer, however I know that it is extremely rare. (Ask any black woman who's cleaned a white person's house, `how much love do you have for your boss.' The relationship between Shanduri and Mr. Kinksy was one of abuse of power and emotional manipulation. During the `relationship' that I watched develop, not once did Shanduri refer to her employer by his first name. Clearly indicating an uneven balance of power and control...not much different from a slave owner offering to free his children born to his African concubine. So, Mr. Kinksy gave up some of his prized possessions; it was European influence that created the climate that allowed Shanduri's husband to be detained indefinitely. Though I am one among several with a different review about the film, I have no reason to forget the long history of abuse past and present that women of color experienced at the hands of white people, especially white men. To see such a film is an insult and another example of how Europeans do not understand the masses of African Americans 
 Give this book a miss.  While the format was okay, the text contains an incredible number of mistakes and omissions.  Consequently, examples, explanations, and exercises often make no sense.  Also, many examples tend to be simplistic to the point of stupidity.  They confer minimal educational value.  Spend your time and money on a book with better content that has been more rigorously proofed 
 I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters. He goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for "the swede", without letting us know who the Swede really is. Roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration. It gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. I loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times 
 This book was a disappointment not only in its poor writing style, but all in the fact that it does not break any new ground.  It is little more than a string of regurgitated self-loathing diatribes written to target an already pre-defined and well-established group of readers who scoop books up like this so that they can cite secondary sources to justify their world view.  Rather than taking a balanced approach with each of the topics they addressed, these authors rush to a conclusion unsubstantiated either in fact or analysis and little true "discovery" is ever made.   I have much more respect for authors who seek to do some spade work in uncovering a new point of view, balanced and justified with deductive reasoning,  not recitations of pre-packaged pabulum already in circulation in dog eared white papers written by disenfranchised college professors.     Fortunately, I bought this book used and my personal loss, other than the time I spent reading it, was minimized.     Bytes  
 I got a free one year sub. to another gaming mag. with purchase of a game at GameStop. After it ended, about 6 months later, i started receiving this magazine, and i thought it was the same one, some kind of mix-up. But I didn't get a magazine every month. It skipped a few. Finally I went on their site to complain, and they promised to send extra issues to make up for it. I told them that there must have been a mixup...Then I cancelled my supposed "subscription", only to receive an e-mail saying that now they wouldn't be sending me anything, even the extra issues promised. Stay AWAY from these people!  These people are extremely unprofessional. Try Playstation mag instead if you have a PS - I was just reccommended it 
 this is the worst book i have ever read,,it is very dull and unuseful..i9 bought it because i have read about the popularity of the surgeon who wrote it. i wish i can return it and get a refund..but i have threogh it in the tras 
 I bought this DVD and it was a complete disaster, full of digital malfunction, you know, those black squares that look like a bad compression setting, and cuts in the audio, and this happens in more than half of the videos in the DVD, I saw another review of a guy who had the same problem so be careful people a lot of this DVD's seem to have this issue 
 I am not a true sports fan or a reader of sports history or biography so my review comes with no past experience.  I truly enjoyed the book and thought it was well written.  It was informative and yet entertaining.  Not only did Morgan capture LeBron's past but gave the readers a glimpse into how his character was built and what we could possibly look for in the years to come.  Congratulations to Morgan on a well-written book 
 This is an interesting book, in that it might encourage the reader to think about things outside of the one's traditional framework.  However, if you take the time to dig up the articles that Radin uses as "proof", you will find that some of them are all but incoherent.  I tracked down the authoring scientist behind some of the papers regarding time, and he informed me that his results were due to chance and not replicable (and also that he is no longer a scientist).  It makes me wonder if Radin actually read the articles before disseminating incorrect information to the public.  I realize that scientists have to eat too, but Radin should never have sold a book at the expense of truth.  Also, be careful with the graphs, which are often organized in a deceptive way.  I can verify that some of the psychokinesis stuff is legit, but I would advise anyone who reads this book to a) take it as fiction, b) find the original articles, and c) try to replicate the experiments yourself.  It sets us all back to have people spreading false information.  Peace 
 "Everything is an echo," Ilan Stavans wrote in the essay Lost in Translation. "To live is to plagiarize, to imitate, to steal." And so he does. The editorial gimmick of putting together anthologies of well-known authors under the common title 'the essential...' is usually reserved to creative writers of fiction and poetry, whose work can be somehow distilled, but Ilan Stavans is an author who has made his reputation primarily by writing about others and the editorial gimmick feels exactly like one because there is no 'essential' Stavans, only the 'echo.' I always found it disturbing to realize how ruthless and brutal Stavans has been against Latina writers, such as Ana Castillo and Sandra Cisneros (see 'Form over Content', p. 41). Stavans has been particularly dismissive of the styles conjured by Chicana writers to create their own respective worlds. The reason for such pathological fear of the language of women may be discerned in this book. Stavans' heroes are usually male writers who loom large above him--Octavio Paz, Walter Benjamin, Elias Canetti, Lionel Trilling--writers Stavans has invoked to 'explore' his own identity as a Latino-Jewish male. By his own admission, Stavans exists in the hyphen of his identity, rather than in the assertion of a self-created identity. This is why he writes so brutally against Chicana writers: because they have destroyed the paradise of hypenations, they have asserted their own identities through the difficult task of creating and molding new identities and a new language to go with it. The short stories in this book, particularly, show Stavans at his most derivative, imitating Kafka while alluding to him 
 I love chick-lit and this book was just average.  It took me a really long time to read because it was a book I could easily put down.  
 Although this book had some interesting things to say, it was, in general, too "compact" for its own good. Bruegmann's arguments against traditional anti-sprawl histories read more like a jedi mind trick than a careful argument. A more careful argument with more supporting facts would have added to the book. As it is, it seems to me that this book will do little to change anyone's view of the 21st century city 
 The main point of this book is well supported with examples from "innovative" organizations.  However, I was continually under the impression that this was a 30 page research paper converted into a 200 page book.  How did the author accomplish this feat?  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  This book is full of redundancies, repetitions, summaries, and introductions that are all superfluous.  When you're done reading this book, you will know the examples of good innovators by heart because they are repeated in every chapter, sometimes multiple times 
 Harvard is doing non-German speakers a great service by compiling all of these essential essays in chronological order. I am baffled, however, that some of the translations are so inaccurate. Non-German readers should know that there are egregious errors in some of these translations, especially those by Rodney Livingstone. I have compared one of his translations closely with the original German and was shocked to find so many inaccuracies. In one sentence Livingstone translates into English the *exact* opposite of what Benjamin actually writes. He doesn't just get the wrong word (as he does elsewhere); he composes a sentence that is the precise negation of what Benjamin wrote. This is very worrisome and does not bode well for the rest of the volume. I have not closely compared the majority of the volume to the original-- I don't have the time for that. But from the little evidence I found in just a few hours it looks bad indeed 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 I was so excited to get this for my iPod.  I love listening to my music in my car, but was really disappointed when it wouldn't fit into my 2003 GMC Envoy.  There are two cup holders in the front, and granted they are in weird spots, but the TuneDok wouldn't fit.  If I put it in the front cupholder, it would interfere with the gear thing, and if I put it in the back cupholder I had no where to put my cups, plus it interfered with the box.  
 Just in time for Christmas is an overpriced book about how much  Doro loves Daddums. The book is a poorly edited collection of  anecdotes that aren't really funny or interesting. (Indeed, they  sound as if they've been transcribed from tapes.) Granted,  daughters have a right to write about Daddy, but this book  makes Ronald Reagan's kids' books look like giant works of art.  What is it about the children of Republicans that makes them  think they can write something of interest?  There are at least 20 very good books about George Sr....  get one of those instead 
 I saw this movie many years ago. I still cannot entirely rid myself of its memory.  It was the only time ever that I nearly threw up in the cinema (literally).  
 If you're looking for a good interpretation of excellent illustrations, then this is your book!  The illustrations are par none, but the writing lacks substance.  Much of the descriptions are but interpretations, some  based on fact, but many imagined.  Readers looking for a very broad  overview will enjoy this book.  Those looking for detail about the ship or  about the history of the time-period would do better with something else 
 Let me see if I have got this right? The only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? That way we all gain? OK the bosses of Nike, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?  Sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!  Well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of Jupiter.   The oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. Even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of England is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. OK, they could ship it in from the rest of the UK where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. It's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.  Has it occurred to anyone, I wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? Yes, I know Marx and Stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not.  
 I feel that it is my duty to inform you that many of the "recipes" in The Anarchist Cookbook are misleading, incorrect, and potentially lethal.  For example, the procedure in the book for making nitroglycerin is incorrect.  If the book's steps are followed, one will end up with nitrotriodite, which is extremely volatile and can explode at the touch of a finger.  William Powell was nothing more than an angry, misinformed hippie.  If you're looking for a more viable source of information about explosive, take some chemistry courses.  The only thing you're going to blow up with this book is yourself 
 Morehouse's book begins to unravel as one reads.  The accounts of remote-viewed things were far too generic and received (ark of the covenant, Mars, complete with ancient living beings, angels in flowing robes no less who guide him) to be believable.  Truth has a certain baroque quality, which this story is lacking.  Also, the reader is informed that angels informed Morehouse that they live in "a dimension parallel to yours."  Hunh?  We live in a three dimensional world (if you do not count time as a dimension) in which each dimension is perpendicular to the other two.  So how is some other dimension parallel to all of these three?  And are the angels saying they exist in a single dimension?  They inhabit a straight line?  We are further informed that God lives in a four-dimensional world.  Gee, so do we, if you count time, which most physicists do.  So... what distinction is being made?  The story smacks of the scientifically impoverished imaginings of the author.  
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 A cool lady I call the Rockchick loaned me this ep; I listened. Man, o, man, this stuff could put trees to sleep.  I told the Rockchick that it sounded like these guys were serenading angels and not people that live on earth.  If you're 15-19 and still have all your hopes and dreams about meeting mr. or ms.right-- get this syrupy ep.   Otherwise, listen to Kasabian or the Dandy Warhols...music that rocks even as it moves all over the place spilling cheer and sonic radiation 
 I am a student currently using this book for a course. I have found this book to be, quite literally, the worst textbook I have encountered. Neither author is a native English speaker and this is quite apparent (especially in the way questions at the end of the chapter are phrased). I can read a question and have no idea what the authors are asking me to find (this isn't a matter of not knowing how). To begin most problems, I have to look at the solutions manual to figure out what it is the authors intended to ask me. If you are a professor considering this book, please, please, please think of your students and find a textbook that is easier to understand!  A few other notes: 1. Questions refer to figures, tables and samples are sprinkled throughout the chaper without giving a page number. I have seen other books that give a page number - this is much more friendly. 2. The notation used in the book is not explained and explanations seem to miss critical steps or concepts 
 Okay, Alex, I'm not reviewing the book.  I just have to respond to you calling people morons.  Yes the computer may make the "recommendations", but if you think Amazon was not aware of this recommendation and its potential to make them a lot of money - you're extremely naive.  I'm not going to be rude and call you a moron.  My mother raised me better than that.  Shame on you and shame on Amazon 
 Just a reminder that this guy cheated on his wife around the same time Clinton was being pounded for his indiscretions.   Sean Hannity, early in his book "Let Freedom Ring" reminded us of how Bill Clinton tainted the office of the presidency and then not two paragraphs later noted how Morris was a good friend of his (Hannity's) and then led into negative opinions on Morris of Clinton.  Didn't bother to mention anything about Morris doing the exact same thing- and this little worm woulda lied with his palm on the Ark of the Covenant so don't give me (...) about the lame@ss lying under oath Republican punk.  (...) hyprocrite!   
 I bought the book due to the reviews, even though I have seen this couple on tv and wondered about them. I found this book way too fantastical. Some of the stories were waaaay out there! I don't even think they investigated any of the cases. Not all of the stories dealt with ghost, some banshees,demons. Also very short book. I wondered if they just wrote down passed down stories 
 WELL THIS IS MY FIRST TIME READING A BOOK BY DONALD GOINES - I DONT THINK I WILL TRY ANOTHER ONE.  I LIKE WHERE THE STORY WAS COMING FROM AND WHERE IT WAS GOING, BUT IT JUST DID NOT HOLD MY INTEREST.  IT WENT FROM BORING TO CONFUSING TO MEANLESS IN EACH CHAPTER.  I DONT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK - IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME, I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH READING IT 
 I noticed this book on a friend's bookshelf in his 1185 Park Avenue apartment.  Interested in the the building, its neighborhood, and its original milieu, I began to read.  To my dismay, I found that Roiphe's book is primarily a recounting of a series of embarrassing and painful episodes from the author's privileged past: foolish and unlikable people hurting themselves and each other, again and again.  Except perhaps as catharsis for the author, the point of the exercise is unclear: there are no insights to be found here 
 This book presents an exhaustive synthesis and systematization of what is more accurately termed "Neo-Sindarin": that is, an altered, synthetic form of Sindarin not as Tolkien ever conceived of it but instead as cobbled together by Salo himself through selective re-use and modification of attested Noldorin forms (which in fact form the vast bulk of the evidence for Salo's "Sindarin") in admixture with actual Sindarin forms and with forms wholly invented by the author. As such, the book misrepresents itself (throughout, and even in its very title) to anyone looking for a reliable examination and presentation of Tolkien's own Sindarin, but if the actual nature of Salo's "Sindarin" is borne in mind throughout, and if the reader assiduously checks the sources against all of Salo's claims and (supposed) data (that is, where the data are not fabricated by Salo, and to the extent allowed by Salo's sparse and often misleading citation of sources), this book can be useful for the student as an introduction to a more accurate and detailed study of Tolkien's own Sindarin 
 In what was billed as a stark challenge to our understanding of Jesus's life and death, as well as the treatment of these subjects by the Church, "The Jesus Papers" falls far short of even the most modest evidentiary standards, relying too much on supposition and speculation.  Thankfully books of this nature need not provide 'lock-solid' proof of their claims to be interesting (or even entertaining) particularly when they are clearly intended to spark debate and confront assumptions which are themselves questionably valid.  While Baigent seemingly writes with this end in mind, he ultimately disappoints providing instead a rambling, meandering summation of his theories that clings (barely) to its narrative structure.  Save yourself the time and money and avoid a book all-too-conveniently produced to coattail off of the release of the blockbuster Da Vinci Code and buy Holy Blood, Holy Grail (by the same author) - a far more persuasive and moving read 
 I looked through the excerps in the hope that this book might be one I would like to add to the collection, and it seems to me to be a waste of money...even though it only costs $5.  Invest that amount into "Uncommon Grounds" by Mark Pendergrast; if you are serious about coffee, I fear "Higher Grounds" will be misleading, or at best, quite vague.   Example: a quote in the book says that one coffee tree produces one pound of coffee.  True, but it should say that one tree produces one pound of roasted coffee...operative word being "roasted".  A layman might not guess at the importance of that fact.  One roasted bean is only about 15% of the original weight of the fruit that the coffee seed/bean is contained in.   Another example that will rub any person with any biological training and one which I noticed immediately: "Coffea arabica" should be typed as such.  This author capitalizes the "a" in arabica, and the first letter of the species name is never capitalized.  I know I'm being picky here, but this is the first impression I received from the book...and I knew my opinion of it would be downhill from there.   The book seems elementary and not worth the money.  Please try something else.  I cannot recommend Pendergrast's "Uncommon grounds: The history of coffee and how it transformed our world" enough!  You could also try "The Devil's Cup" for coffee's influence on global societies...just do not buy "Higher Grounds"!  Libraries exist for a reason.  
 Here's a bit of misinfo: the author claims Sydney Poitier won an oscar for the 1968 film Lilies of the field. Wrong! Lilies of the field was a 1963 film.  The meaning he reads into Romans 1:26-27 (which outright discadvocates homosexuality for both men and women) is pretty lame. In fact it's practically double talk. His advocacy of homosexuality is strange and hard to understand. He seems to be saying when God punishes someone and that person committs homosexuality only then its it a sin.  Wrong! He also quotes Romans 1:21 but leaves out some of the scripture between 21 and 26. Why? Obviously because the scripture in between disadvocates homosexuality even more and bigtime  calling it vile and or disgusting and clearly there's no defending that. Face it Spong. Homosexuality is a bad sin. In the back there is quotes of some of the Bible and you sure don't see Genesis 2:24 anywhere. This is the quote that talks of man woman becoming one as mates. Not only does the Bible out and out disadvocate homosexuality it positively advocates heterosexuality.  He also picks on God's chosen Jewish people (he's a Christian clergyman remember) for fighting Palestinians even though muslims are far more violent on average  than Jews or Christians. Guess he wants the Israelis to get defeated by being paficists and let the PLO beat and bomb them senseless 
 I read this book in the hopes of gaining a helpful framework for thinking about - and perhaps even achieving - my "number" for retirement, but that is not what I found between its covers.  Mostly the book concerns itself with the soul - searching and anguish that people who have 1 - 10 million dollar "nest eggs" go through in trying to decide if its enough to support them in the manner to which they have become accustomed, until such time as they pass on.  Although I really FEEL for these people, my financial situation is much more in sync with the run-of-the-mill American, and for us Mr. Eisenberg has barely a mention, let alone advice. On a positive note, I did find his writing style to be very engaging. Bottom line - I would have to recommend that you avoid this book and use the time saved to read something more useful and/or fun 
 Could not get in to story, jumped around so much, worse book I have tried to read 
 This woman doesn't need to practice safe sex. I would guess from seeing her on tv that she never had an opportunity. Her views are not mainstream despite her wishes to 'fit in' and define morals. I glanced at this book and content and she if forceful and adamant about her views. Not an open-minded lady rather highly-opinionated, ruthless provocateur woman's libber. A disgrace to feminity and society..  
 In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.  The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it.   At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed 
 Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers 
 After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money.  After reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand, but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous 
 Being somewhat familiar with Marsden's writing I looked forward with great anticipation to reading this book. Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism are subjects with which I have significant familiarity and very great interest. The book was a disappointment and for me was simply a dreary recitation of facts with nothing to give it life 
 As much as I loved the features and music from Bruces' 30th anniv. Born to Run package, I disliked Devils & Dust. I am about 2 weeks older than Mr.Springsteen and have most of his music, seen him preform 6 times. the last in early 2002. I enjoyed the acoustic parts of the concert and the RIsing cd very much. But this one excapes me and doesn't touch what I love about his lyricism, use of instrumentation, and ability to put simple concepts into complex settings, or complex feelings into simple yet elegant lyrics...on Devils he puts highly personal and obscure messages into obscure settings. I wish for more poetry as found on his first three albums and tunnel of love. I hope others will find these songs more personal to them, I just can't find my way into them, didn't like Nebraska or Tom  Joad either. sorry, Bruce... seado 
 This book is not really a guide, its a selection of specs and line drawings that you could get online from the manufactures 
 You don't want to read a book about writing that is badly written.  As far as I can tell, Usborne figured that since the book is offline, it should not follow the high-impact rules of writing that he would use online.  Well, online and offline writing is not THAT different!  This book is turgid and useless.  Other books on the market are superior 
 THIS IS UTTER LIBERAL NONSENSE.  PLEASE.  GIVE ME A BREAK.  LIBERALS NEED TO GET OVER THEMSELVES 
 It says on the box it fits 30,60,80 gig 5th Gen ipods. It did not fit my 60 gig. I showed it to my wife who loved it and kept it for her 30.   This is a beautiful case for the 30 gig ipod ONLY!!!!!!!  BEWAR 
 The VHS took quite a while to arrive. I had ordered 5 other items at the same time and it arrived almost 3 weeks later than all the others, I actually had given up on it's showing up.  The video itself rolls quite a bit at the end of the video when played. However, with the age of the movie, I will grant them some slack.  I was disappointed in service and the product.  I will not buy another movie from this seller 
 This book was a good attempt at understanding poverty; however, some of the information was unsupported.  Payne provides strategies for working with students from a low socio-economic status that were positive. For instance, the strategies were charts, graphs, and scenarios that were provided to better understand her message.   Payne also explains that poverty is not always about finances.  She is well intentioned, but she could have provided more unbiased research.  In an effort to understand poverty she defines and describes "Hidden Rules" within each social class.  For example, Dr. Payne claims education for people in poverty is abstract.  We would disagree with this point of view for the simple fact that it is over generalization.  On the other hand, she makes a good point in saying that the different rules are to be used for different situations and not one set of rules or behaviors is better than the other.   We feel that anyone who plans on reading "A Framework for Understanding Poverty" should do so, but only with a critical eye. For those who wish to understand poverty and this is the first book they read, must be aware that some of the information is not supported by statistics or studies.  For instance, Payne says that women in poverty use their bodies to acquire what they want and need.  She also says that if you are in poverty, everything in life is seen as a joke.  As well intended as Dr. Payne's attempt is at establishing a "framework" she fails to address issues of race and gender and how these issues also affect ones socio-economic class.  Over all, this book should be read but the reader should understand that it is not a "framework" and the ideas should not be applied to "all" individuals in poverty.   
 This film, like most of his early work, is for Hitchcock aficionados only. I am an admirer of Hitchcock and also enjoy old British films, but I still found this movie tough going, not least because of the 110 mins running  time. The picture quality of this Laserlight DVD is not perfect, but it is  perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you'd expect for the  price. The musical score is also okay, but nothing to write home about.  Laserlight do however pose a mystery that Hitch himself would have been  proud of. This DVD has no commentary, no documentary and no trailer, not  even one of those awful Tony Curtis intros. So why do Laserlight describe  this DVD as a 'Special Edition'  
 Man, there's no way to describe this movie.  Slow, boring, unidimensional, bad plot, really bad acting... Really low-budget (in a bad way)  I'm not gonna get my time or my money back. I bought it based on the reviews, and they were really off... Even if you enjoy the gothic ambience, believe me, it's really bad.   You've been warned 
 It did not fit my phone and I was forced to go out and but another one 
 Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book.  I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.  In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.  I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so.  This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined.  Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts.  Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired 
 Only about 1/3 of this book is about pirate queens.  The other 2/3 is the author being absorbed with herself.  Why she thinks that her Outward Bound experiences or her opinions about German tourists are of interest to anybody but herself is beyond me.  This is a pity because when she does write about pirate queens it is clear she has done her homework and she tells a good story. Skip this book unless you want to learn how to write history like a Californian 
 To say that Islam tolerates Homosexuality is a very humorous claim indeed. This author focuses on practices done by corrupt muslims who do not even read their own book. The Quran numerously talks about Homosexuality, Condeming it over and over. First it warns the men not to leave their wives and go for other men. Another verse states How God dealt a destructive Force (severe storms) on the People of "Lot" that instantly killed all their inhabitants as punishment for such a sinful act. Then there are the VAST testimonies of Homosexual muslim who choose not to engage in Homosexual acts and lead a Heterosexual life in order not to Sin in the name of God. I could go on, this is so pathetic that it's not even worth my time reviewing this. MY ADVICE, BEFORE YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING SOMEONE SAYS OR WRITES ABOUT, do your own independant research to see if the author is honest or just a fanatic. In this cas go read what the Quran really says about homosexuals 
 As a teacher, I read a lot of books about education and childhood development.  Real Boys is typical of most of these books in that the author takes 500-600 pages to say what he could have expressed in 100 pages.  Read the first chapter and you get the point of the whole book. 
 i bought this CD because it had all my fave fred hammond songs on it. but little did i know that they are all, ALL bad versions of them! you can't even sing along! this CD sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS CD 
 Good actors pick up their paychecks in a weakly scripted cop show. Plot elements are familiar to anyone who owns a TV. No suspense, zero surprises. Most viewers will find that they are better detectives than the characters on screen. 
 I purchased this book in hopes of getting the most out of my Bowflex Extreme 2. Other reviewers seemed to really like this book, so maybe I'm way off in my expectations. I've been working out for quite a while and recently purchased a Bowflex in hopes of saving time & money by working out at home instead of the gym. I'm not so sure about that decision now... The author uses this book to tell long background stories about back when he worked here or there. It seems to be long winded information that could be summed up without all the page fill & fluff. The diet plan is a no-brainer - it is such a calorie restricted diet anyone will lose weight on it, with or without the Bowflex. 1200 - 1000 calories a day for women will work no matter what. The before and after photos depict weight loss, but I didn't notice anyone making any kind of muscle gains. He makes the Bowflex sound like a magic wand and it's not. To gain muscle you have to work, and his proposed workouts are laughable. I get more exercise grocery shopping than his "workouts". The exercises demonstrated are fine if you have that particular model of Bowflex, but the book is outdated and not helpful if you own an Extreme or Ultimate. I say save your money unless you've never exercised before in your life and have absolutely no idea how exercise & your body work 
 Well, I finally purchased something at amazon, and now I too can write a review. I note the warning to "focus your comments on the product." Which is, I admit, a fair request, but with this series of books (this one being the newest), the review must include things other than the product itself.  These books are vanity projects. No publisher which respects the special significance of a children's book should allow this monster, Madonna, anywhere near such things. The reviews for the other books in this series tend to be comprised of two camps: Madonna's feckless fans, ecstatic over the release of any new "product," and the small percentage of the population which encounters the books by accident, with the latter category almost unanimous in their condemnation of these "works."  Madonna is a person who happened to be in the right place at the right time, and had enough sense to decide to exploit herself to make a dollar over the last twenty years. And, because she was a willing participant, that makes her a genius to some of you. Not to me.  Outside of her catchy pop songs, which even I enjoy for the fluff they are, Madonna has made the bones of her career out of a ceaseless parade of cheap stunts, almost always involving sex. Her body of work which has made her a celebrity has almost nothing to do with music, and everything to do with reckless and clumsy titillation. The last  three times Madonna caught our attention, she was pouring hot candle wax on a man's genitals in the terrible film Body of Evidence, hanging naked from chains in an S&M club in her Sex book, and hanging from a mirrored disco cross while wearing a crown of thorns to open her most recent tour.  The reason why she is producing these books is not to improve the quality of children's material, nor is it to raise money for charity, as she is already so wealthy it matters not if she receives so much as one penny from these sales. If she wants to donate to charity, she can always sell one of her castles.  The reason she is doing this is to shovel her sick, twisted view of life straight down the throats of the most impressionable members of society. The books exist to introduce children to her name, so that they may remember her, and then go on to discover her life's work, which is nothing but greed, self-exploitation, and depravity.  The books themselves provide Madonna with the thrill of being famous and talked about, which is worth more to her than money, as she already has plenty of money. The books are not good. It is well understood that if a non-celebrity were to submit these projects, they would be rejected. However, due to her name, they will sell. Madonna then takes that as some kind of indication that her work has triumphed, as you can tell, as the self-serving introduction to this newest book indicates.  I could go on, at length, but briefly: Madonna moralizes, but she had her daughter, Lourdes, sired from a brief encounter with a man she admits she no longer has anything to do with. She points the finger over money, but is herself a supremely wealthy person who lives a lavish, materialistic lifestyle. She preaches humility, yet contrary to the tradition of children's books, she denies credit on the books' covers to the artists who illustrate them.  You could not ask for a more repulsive and hypocritical role model. She is a [...] actress who sings, and is the last among us who should be writing children's books. If you have not gone mad, I would suggest that you purchase any one of the many, many wonderful children's books available, or take the time to play with your child and write one together just for fun.  Do not, under any circumstances, buy these books, unless it is for a gag gift, and only then, do so only if you can be guaranteed it will be burned to ashes in less than an hour after the joke is over, lest the damn things find their way into a library or a school.  To reiterate: These books are vanity projects and garbage, meant to indoctrinate children into Madonna's wretched life philosophy. Avoid every one of them, and when you get the chance, do us all a favour, and destroy them 
 I think I never want to see  Another stanza by A.E.  I pity now the friends of Terence,  And eke his siblings, pets and parents.  For oh, good Lord the verse he made--  Too grim and too much in the shade:  The doomstruck lad, the Severn missed,  The Ludlow fair where he got pissed,  The London blues, the snow-hung orchard,  Young life cut short in syntax tortured,  And favorite of all his themes,  The Shropshire schoolboy's martial dreams.  Brave verse to stop a soldier shirking  By one whose work was patent-clerking.  "Stand up, be brave, lad, if you please,  So poets here may live at ease.  "And we shall rhyme and wring our hands  When you're cashiered in distant lands.  For really, 'tis not bad, the grave--  No care, no pain, no need to shave.  "So blah blah blah by Severnside,   And good for you, young suicide."  Well, he's dead too, now, old A.E.  Arrived where he most longed to be.  What's done is done, some good, much bad,  But still he toils, this Shropshire lad,  Producing yet from under plow  Some wholesome food for Shropshire cow 
 This book is a big disappointment.  The cover brags that the book contains "15,000 entries - more listings than any other guide!"  What the cover doesn't tell you is that for hundreds of these listings, the counts  of sugar and fiber are listed as "data not available."  I'm not  talking about exotic foods here; there are missing entries for basics like  apples and bananas.  I am surprised and disappointed that the authors and  the publisher would market such a sloppy and incomplete book.  With so much  missing information, even for many basic foods, I have found this book to  be nearly useless and quite frustrating.  I plan to return this book for a  refund.  Save your money on this one 
 Iam a big fan of lindsey's work in Fleetwood Mac but this was terrable!!! It just goes to show he is nothing with out Stevie Nicks. I was a fool in buying something i never hered about before. I should have listen to my mum and got Sevie's new album, "Trouble in Shangri-La" which is doing exelent on the radio and charts. The only reason i gave it a 2 star is because i feel sorry for him! 
 Maybe it's because this product is not approved for windows, but I couldn't get it to install 
 This was my first -- and last -- Cat Who book.  I bought it because I needed something to read at the beach, but found it so inane that I went for another swim instead.  Having spent money on the book, I felt obligated to eventually finish it.  I kept wondering when I would discover the plot, but alas, the book ended without one.  I had hoped to read a mystery story, but the only mystery -- the body found on Qwilleran's property -- was never developed.  Another reviewer called this book a pastiche -- a quite appropriate word.   Want to write a book like this?  Here's how...  Take a small town newspaper, cut out stories at random, then stick them together.  Throw in a rather silly single male journalist who spends his days wandering in and out of other people's lives, writing corny sayings and then attributing them to his cat (I thought Koko was supposed to be smart!), eating in restaurants, and traveling between his various properties 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 First, the print quality is very good.  When it does work, it seems to work very well.  I was pleased with the print quality and features, and the print speed is excellent.  But the real problem is the extremely unstable software.  More than half the time, I could not start a scanning operation without it failing.  And when it fails, it really fails, and the only way to get it back working again is to pull the plug on the printer (that's right - the power button won't turn off the printer power when this happens), AND restart the computer which was the target of the scan output.   Since I normally do a fair amount of scanning, this meant most days having to reboot both printer and computer, just to do a simple scanning job.  The printing software was also iffy, although not nearly the problem as was the scanner software.   Probably 10% of the time, a print job would not complete.  The HP Image software which came with the printer was a very useful and straight-forward photo-processing tool, which I would recommend for the most part.  HP chose, however, to ignore all the normal Windows software conventions, (like having a File and Edit menu at the top of the screen), so you are always having to hunt around on-screen for what you want to do.    Bottom line:  I hate playing the "print/scan lottery", wondering whether my print or scan job will actually work, each time I try to print or scan something.   This is not a finished product, and I strongly recommend buying something else 
 I bought this CD for my daughter because of the words 'Karaoke' on the cover. I thought that it would be a real Karaoke CD- one that provides words on the screen of a Karaoke Machine. It does have the words inside the package but not in the CD. To me that is false advertising. It is a lovely collection of Disney tunes-but 11 of them are instumental! How are you supposed to sing along with instrumental songs? I feel like I was dupped and riped off 
  The work "Island of Seven Cities" by Paul Chiasson suggests the existence of vestiges of a 15th-century Chinese settlement on Cape Breton. The complete fiction of these claims are demonstrated by detailed rebuttals here: www.1421exposed.com  The publishers Random House Canada have published this fiction as non-fiction with not one effort at verification of the claims within. They have in effect colluded with Mr Chiasson in deceit of the public and there needs to be public censure of such publishers who engage in such deceit with complete contempt of the public's interest 
 I have had this knife set for just over 2 months and the knives are starting to rust! They have only been handwashed, as reccomended. I would not purchase this product again. 
 This is the kind of a book  that temporarily makes you feel that you will change automatically, just by reading it.  Let's start with term "inner brat"  vs. "inner child". I agree, some people who follow "inner child" psychology, really are looking for an excuse not to change, they get stuck in mourning stage forever, and absolve any kind of responsibility themselves.  As I like the books that require action and personal responsibility, I was encouraged at first.  As I read, I found the book to be too general and its advice hard to utilize in a consistant way. Too much generalization: not everyone with problems has  an immature "brat" living iniside of them. Some had some real hard "stuff" happen to them. They can't dismiss it, yet, they need to make peace with it, and find it to move on on their own terms.   The author scratches surfaces, without really covering anything in any depth.   If I had to summarize the problem with the book I'd say this: The advice in it is about what sounds good to people who don't want to change, yet, not something that mobilizes you into real logical action.  I'd be willing to bet that most of the people who gave it stellar reviews ("this book has changed my life!!!"), did nothing more than read the book once, and then never really applied it to achieve any kind of meaningful chang 
 First of all, everyone is entitled to their opinion.  While I respect everyones take on this album, I am amazed by how varied our tastes are and by how much we vary on this album.  Frankly, I didn't care for this album at all.  The songs do not match the singers - with few exceptions.  Angie Stone sounded great and Fantasia was good.  I will say that my favorite song and rendition on this album was Celine Dion's.  Yes, I am a fan of hers but I can be impartial.  Her voice and style blended perfectly with the emotion of the song.  Maybe because she lost her father and can show the emotional range required to be able to sing it.  No one can sing it like Luther but Celine came close.  Luther had a rare talent and the music industry will suffer for this loss.  Overall, you can skip the album and just preview the songs and buy your favorites individually. 
 I agree with S. Haus.  I was also disappointed.  The interiors of the homes in the book are generally dark and unwelcoming (unlike the one on the cover).  I prefer the multitudes of other books that combine accurate colonial decorative schemes with a modern, lived-in feel, rather than something straight out of a tour of Benjamin Franklin's 18th century home.  Not sure why some other reviewers seem to attack the S. Haus review; makes me wonder if they know the author personally

 In this book, Byron York only promises to present the evidence of a vast Left-Wing conspiracy - and that is all he presents.  The discussion here is limited to what left-leaning money has done. Primarily, this amounts to a muckraking castigation of George Soros for pointing out the fascistic tendencies inherent in Bush Administration policies and a denigration of Soros' concerns that the US is now, currently, moving in the same direction as NAZI Germany in the period between the World Wars.  There is no discussion here of any sort of moneyed conspiracy on the other side of the aisle:  no reference to the vast amounts of AmWay (DeVoss family) money available to smear Democrats and moderate Republicans; no reference to the vast amounts of  WalMart (Walton family) or Timkin (Timkin family) money available to do away with a justified and justifiable estate transference tax; and absolutely no reference to the extremely close, and extremely profitable, relationships between George Bush and Ken Lay (Enron) or between George Bush and Jack Abramoff (Republican corruption and treason) 
 Well. The poor bugger got sacked after having sacrified most of his life fixing things for the boys. The story is clattered with errors but that's probably because it is told straitght from the heart. This is probably also why you have to read some stories at least three times. Having complained before about this publishing house I will once again urge J.Blake to invest in a senior editor 
 as the director and actors of this mess should, on their skinny french knees.  Complete waste of film and your time. Not erotic, sexy (? was that actress really a woman?, was her boyfriend really a man? or visa/versa) Damned if I could tell.  And that old man who tired her up, ya think he had enough rope? The movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through.  French people are not pretty, and this woman was not only NOT pretty, but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma.  Even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog.  Save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience 
 It's ironic (and perhaps moronic) that Hinton should choose none other than Joni Mitchell as a subject for a biography.  Not only is Mitchell one of the most gifted and literate songwriters of the 20th Century, she is  also one of the most iconoclastic, as well...shunning publicity that most  'rock stars' consume with a spoon.  And its these circumstances which point  out the failings in this dismal read: Hinton can't write and what he has  written are quotes of Mitchell herself when she has deigned to submit to  personal interviews.  It's appalling that the publisher went ahead with  such a shoddy and thoroughly uninformative book about one of the great pop  icons of our century 
 This book did have a great start... I was flipping through the pages reading, and I was left with a one page- "how to"... I thought that this whole book was to HELP you conquer your insecurities, not just give you a quick little "over-view" of what you're SUPPOSED to be doing...  The title is misleading, and I definently wouldn't recommend this self-help book to anyone 
 I usually like this author and have read almost all of her books; however, after reading this book I definitely felt cheated. The book is well written, and the characters were pleasing, although I thought Faith was not being true to her character as presented in earlier books in the series. Agatha Christie used to say that a mystery writer must play fair with his or her readers. All of the evidence and the clues must be laid out for the reader to try to solve the mystery before the author resolves it. To do otherwise is to cheat the reader who has invested time in reading the book. No reader had a chance to solve this mystery unless by sheer guessing. Once the murderer is revealed, the reader realizes that it really could have been anyone, and all the clues have meant nothing. I was very disappointed, so I will think twice about getting any of her new books 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 Buyer beware. This item is junk. The cheap plastic pump put out a dribble and the quit. I should have read the other reviews before purchase. I'm surprised Amazon continues to sell this after so many negitave reviews 
 This book is a textbook and it feels like one from beginning to end.  "Pedantic" is a gross understatement. The exercises are useful but I think a budding writer might find this program more harmful than helpful, in it's desire to make sure you're always following his rules.  In the end his approach might get you some ideas.. but not before it sucks all the fun out of the creative process.    If, on the other hand, you are a type A personality who really wants a rigid set of rules so you can feel secure in tackling something creative, maybe this will work for you.  But my impression is that the aim of the book is to make storytelling so complicated and boring that he wants you to give up writing by the time you finish reading it.  I'm a writer who buys all these books as way of refreshing my process and finding new inspiration.  "Inspiring" this book is not 
 If you're looking for soundtrack recordings, DO NOT GET THIS!! It's nothing but sick, annoying, noisy, GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This is what happens when great authors go to seed. It seems like a cruel mockery of a Greene novel, parading the same old themes around, corrupted more than ever by an unjustified excess liberalism. There isn't a single living character here, and even though the prose is generally competent, I think it has to be buried in consideration of the man's memory 
 Choose your attitude, Play, Make their day and be present.  There I saved you the 2 hours it takes to read this book 
 Boyd's revised edition of Virgil's Aeneid is the essential book to prepare for the AP Latin: Virgil exam or just become familiar with this favorite of all Classicists.  With all the lines on the AP syllabus and no more, Boyd's Aeneid effectively prepares students to be familiar with all the lines that may appear on the test.  Each page has a paragraph of Latin text, with numerous footnotes underneath, offering translation help through grammar and vocabulary hints.  A glossary in back serves as quick reference to unfamiliar words.  While Clyde Pharr's edition has similar detail in footnotes and vocabulary, the Pharr text contains ALL of books 1-9 only, meaning that students have to take home a heavier textbook and also purchase a separate text for books 10-12 of the Aeneid.  Thus, Boyd spares students from searching for the passages that will actually be covered: it contains only what is on the syllabus.  It is a great way to study Virgil's classic epic 
 Thomas Hine's "The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager" is based on a very interesting topic, one which I was extremely excited to learn more about.  However, when I began reading the book, I was immediately turned off by Hine's writing style.  Hine took a topic that could have been a great work of sociology, and turned it into nothing more than a textbook of history.  Occasionally, he gets off topic, and uses first person not to share his own experiences, but to say something like, "I have already talked about..."  His sources aren't cited in the text, and his sentences are short, choppy, and have no real flow to them.  He often touches on greatness and his writing at times flourishes, but for the most part, the book reads like a poorly completed textbook.  Everything I got from this book's 300 pages can be gathered by simply reading the inner sleeve of the cover and the preface.  No real need to waste your time here 
 Both the playing and the singing on this much-debated CD are absolutely pitiful, at best. It is possible to see a tiny germ of talent in Mr Doherty's words, in a sort-of E J Thribb pretentiousness, and he is supposed to be a very nice guy away from the lights. The live performances on the TV, unredeemably lamentable, tend to reinforce some people's view that this emperor is very definitely without clothes. There is so much good music, new and old, that I cannot see why anybody should seek out this second-rate stuff. Even in these days of British New Labour mediocrity, wherein nobody can be "bad" at anything or "fail" at anything, by law, it is unacceptable. This band would have been booed off stage in any rural village hall in England in the sixties as insulting their audience. On the other hand, perhaps that is what Doherty is trying to get at in the title song ? If so, I duly remove my hat to him, but I doubt it somehow.  I bought this album in the belief from the publicity that there was flawed genius at work. There isn't. It's dreadful. I was not allowed to give it no stars. There is absolutely no excuse for rubbish like this to see the light of day - it makes Fall Out Boy (see my review of Cork Tree on Amazon.com) seem like Cream. Actually, on second thoughts, it makes Fall Out Boy sound at least one-tenth competent.  Spend your hard-earned on a road map of Eilat. It will be more interesting than the meanderings of these awful people.  
 Just read the software documentation and save your money. Hardly any difference 
 THIS PERFUME SMELLS LIKE YOU JUST SPRAYED LEMON PLEDGE ALL OVER.  IT WAS TERRIBLY STRONG AND JUST NOT QUITE WHAT I WANTED.  THE COMPANY DID PROMPTLY GIVE ME A REFUND THOUGH.  I SUGGEST YOU TRY OUT "DEMETER FRAGRANCES."  THEY ARE MORE NATURAL SMELLING 
 I purchased these clubs for my son who juggles well with balls and wanted to progress. His is 19 and took care when he tried to use them but they fell apart after 2 months of very little use. The company was completely unsympathetic I would recomend trying more expensive ones or from a different company 
 The First Four years was released many years after These Happy Golden Years brought a sweet, tidy ending to the series. I did not like this book and it just does not feel like it belongs with the other books. It is about hardship and bitter times and disturbs the harmony of the other titles. I'd recommend serious thought be given before this book is begun 
 This film was one confusing blob of a mess. One of the worst films I've ever seen. It made me never want to read a Ludlum novel, since that's what it was based on. When I heard an audiotape of Ludlum's memoirs, and he said how he LIKED this film, it REALLY made me never want to read one of his books. Even Michael Caine in his autobiography says that when he got on the set, he read the script more closely, only then to realize it didn't make any sense. But he was stuck, and had to film the darn thing 
 I read a lot of good things about Eric Meyers and people say he's practically like the king of CSS teachers or something. I read reviews from amazon about this book and decided it was time I read this book. At first, it seemed like a good book, explaining core concepts of CSS to me. I've been using it for years, but never really had a book teach me everything, I picked it up as I went along. However, as I reached further into the book, the topics became more complicated and his explanations became weaker and weaker. There are no practical examples. I was hoping to get some insight in the way certain code could be used but instead, this was more like a help/reference manual which made me wonder why I even needed this book in that case when there are great help/reference manuals all over the Internet.  I thought reading this book would make me like Mr. Meyer's apprentice, to learn from the master. It was like going to an experienced carpenter and being told "This is a hammer, u hit nails with it." and then leaving. I was looking for more like "this is a hammer, notice how if I hit it hard it causes a dent in the wood, but a soft touch allows you to keep an even wood surface, use least amount of energy and still get the job done."  I learnt more about CSS from other books that were nothing more than basic introductions 
 I have been around football my entire life, being that my dad is a coach, and has been for 18 years. I was amazed to read the perspective of this player who did not live up to "his" potential. He sounds like a bitter young man. Obviously he had more confidence in himself, than coaches who have been in the game for much longer than he has even been alive. Sometimes players don't understand the processing that coaches go through to put together a game plan, and then to carry it out. Yes, it is unfortunate that he had to have four coaches throughout his career, but at least he had the oppurtunity to play the game. There are many other young men who would have loved to at least get to play at the University of Oklahoma, or anywere else. So sometimes people should be greatful for their oppurtunities 
 I bought this album on the strength of reviews like the ones here but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The musical material is shallow, his voice is OK but has a rather irritating wide vibrato. It's fine for background music but for serious listening look elsewhere 
 This is so far one of the most boring Nora Roberts books, ever.  It was OK but it seriously was a PUSH to get through it, and usually I simply just fly through her novels.  The characters are very flat and uninvolved.  I was able to guess whodunit way before the act was even done, as well as guess some of the plot twists.  The book was fun for the trip to Hollywood-land but besides that it was a LONG book (528 pages) that really would have been better off slimmed down.  Lots ado about nothing which leads to boring repeat events and pointless happenings that in the end you discover served no purpose at all to the story.  If you are a NR fan, you may like it but I suggest perhaps finding another novel to read first and borrow this one from a friend.  
 this is a sad waist of money, move has the same old high school story line and could have been a good move, but it is drawn out and the acting made me sick 
 As a clinician-scientist, I believe in evidence based medicine There is no evidence base to support the work-out shown here to my knowledge have been proven to build bones as opposed to other types of exercise. As scientist from respected institution like NASA can tell you, the only most important way the body needs to stimulate bone building is periodic weight-bearing exercises & stepping. The same view is shared by neurophysiologists of NIH of USA This kind of title is extremely misleading & should be taken with a grain of sal 
 The personnel responsible for making this wretch of a film should be ashamed.  Way to sell out 
 JAK books are, imho, one of the best in the market right now.Her stories are spun from a truly talented mind, with determined yet understanding heroines and dark brooding heroes, and laced with humour and wit that never fail to bring smiles and laughter. PERFECT PARTNERS however, sadly lacked this winning JAK formula. It comes across as an absolutely frustrating novel, with a bossy and oftentimes irritating heroine, and a narrow-minded  henpecked hero.Definitely the worst JAK book around 
 This is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen.  I was expecting it to be bad, but this movie just went beyond that 
 I purchased this for my eight year old niece. We were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks.  Be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer. The program takes up a lot of memory on your computer's hard drive 
 This is a lousy book.  The author is very stylistically skilled.  Its a shame that she cant write on anything of substance.  The result is a well written book about foolishness.  The author should use her skills for something meaningful.  This type of writing, that pervades our magazines and popular culture has probably had an extremely negative influence on gullible idiots.  Our country is in trouble if the opinions expressed in the articles in this book represent any sizable amount of the population.  I threw this book away after reading it. I wish I had not paid good money for it 
 Falls over constantly. Fustrating for everyone. Only good thing is the sleeping bag that comes with it 
 There are some tidbits of info in this book that are educational, but it in no way focuses on S-corps (the subtitle is deceptive). It is more an incomplete overview with some brief stops to go in depth on select topics, with examples and discussion biased mostly towards C-corps. I was surprised that the chapter on which state to incorporate in only discussed Delware (and not even well). There should definitely be a discussion on Nevada as it has become a highly considerable candidate for the honor. As I completed the book it became apparent to me that this was largely written pre-2001 (this is an opinion), although it is copyright 2003. The author's preable in which it is introduced that the tax rates have changed, but that the reader should just keep that in mind instead of the author going back and revising the numbers, is emblematic of the off-the-cuff manner in which this book was written and proofed. 
 This book was cumbersome to say the least.  When looking for a plan I narrowed down my wants to 1) Garage not facing the street 2) 3800 sq feet and up 3) Master Suite very large.  After that I found several plans, and pondered them down to my dream house.  Then I ordered the plan, spent $1200 and got absolutely nothing useful.  These plans are not as advertised.  One cannot actually build a house from the prints that are bought.  My many phone calls were not returned, the company rep angrily argued with my contractor, my money was not returned and I was lightly threatened.  Overall, the plans are nice to look at with a magnifying glass, but performance of promises is nil.  I know that my dream house was dashed by this book 
 As a believer in God, I was hoping for a new balanced discussion of  creation, life and its origins. The first part of the book is a rehash of the many already established arguments for and against a Creator. Nothing new there. The middle section makes a better argument for "macroevolution" than I had previously understood However, this in no way adequately explains away the nagging counter-argument to macroevolution of "irreducible complexity" as put forth by Dr. Beh. The third part is "witnessing" for Christ, pure and simple and does not belong in a book that is purportedly a scientific expounding of the relevant arguments. The appendix is a filler or the book would have been too short. Finally, the argument for "theistic evolution" is weak and unsupported and violates all the premesis the author had used to argue against "intelligent design" 
 I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with "mi tierra". The main thing on this is the track selection, wich makes the whole a very downtempo album. Althought there's a couple of up & high beat pieces, the sensation I percive it's like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album. That's no bad. The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can't get down, Just a little bored. There's no feeling, no emotion, no heart, no music. If you are planning to buy a gloria's CD, don't get this one. Mi tierra would do it best 
 Pat picked too many mainstream metal songs to cover here. It would have been cooler and more ballsy to have picked songs from bands like Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, GWAR, and Goo Goo Dolls 
 I seldom pan books, but this one is little more than an egotistic rehash of simplified versions of AI/AL theories of the past 3 decades. The only new data are the author's opinions. If you are looking for anything new and/or in depth, look elsewhere 
 The Uno's MIDI input did not work with my Roland A-37 MIDI controller keyboard, even after downloading the latest drivers.  Using Cakewalk (Home Studio 4 running on a Compaq V2000 laptop) to record and view the individual MIDI events, I could see that some of the note-off messages had been improperly decoded by the Uno as note C-zero.  This caused those notes to ring indefinitely and caused an ultra-low note to sound... very unpleasant and obviously unusable.  The MIDI output did work fine driving my Roland Fantom XR and Roland JV-1010 with no problems.  After reading another Uno & A-37 user's identical problem (on Amazon), I returned the Uno and purchased an Edirol(Roland) UA-25 audio/MIDI interface.  It works perfectly with all of my equipment including the A-37 
 I gave this a 2nd star for a support call ms provided.  If you do have a frontpage server, and have it set "on", it had some advantages over ftp.  I bought it for use on our family website which is mainly pictures.  I've used 6-8 programs for creating galleries over the years.  I think a perl script using Linux' mogrify worked best.  This works worst!  The free ones w/ the digital cameras beat it.  Frontpage is missing the most fundamental piece to view photos-  A next/previous button.  You can choose from several thumbnail displays including a cool mosaic/colage type thing.  Once you expand it, you must remember the shot you were on, back up, and then click on the next one!  Unbelievable.    I know what I need for handling photos efficiently.  Flicr has it- cross-tab indexing of the same photo.  I think picassa is close and getting closer.  This wasn't worth the cost of Picassa- FREE 
 Ok, booty rap was good in the 90's, when it was offensive and raunchy like, 2 live crew, Disco Rick and The Dogs, Poison clan etc.....But this is just wack weak lyrics, corny typical krunk beats that start all sounding the same....And is it just me are these guys as rappers, just horrible there voices all raspy, and annoying and one the guy's from the groups always does that annoying shout thing in interviews like hahhhhherrrrrr.....( what is he on crack or something)So if you like radio friendly, pretty boy music then the Ying Yang twins are for you peace... 
 This product is a waste of money after the lightbulb goes out and the lighbulb didn't last very long in the first place. Polyconcept does not make the lightbulbs available in the stores.  After numerous phone calls to Polyconcept (manufacturer) I have yet to receive replacement light bulbs!!!  So basically, it is now useless. 
 I just finished reading the original unabridged version of this book, in  French, and believe me, I was moved.  So when my wife and I wanted to get  an abridged version for her to read in English, we bought this one.  On  skimming through the book, and maybe it's just us, but we found no trace of  Fantine's story before she ended up in Jean Valjean's care, or of Jean  Valjean's rescue of Cosette from the Thénardiers, which are both very  moving parts.  If those are missing, there are probably other very touching  and important parts missing.  We plan on taking our version back and  getting the full version.  It would be better to just skip past the  sections that talk about the convent, the battle of Waterloo, the sewer  system, etc., because they're wasy to skip, and the rest of the book will  still be there.  Honestly, Les Mis is probably the best book I've ever  read, but it has to be purchased in it's full format to really be truly  appreciated 
 yes this book is about a love story between bussy and dame monsoro.  her husband monsoro is not getting any, how would you feel. this book teaches you a lesson and this lesson, don't buy books you don't know, cause they [are bad 
 At first you think that this book is going to give you insight into the stardard language as spoken in Britain, Australia, and so on. There is a lot on diversity but we never quite get to the practical side of things and it is all left a bit unclear. What I needed was a straightforward guide for my work, when I travel on business, so I avoid misunderstandings and get the language right when I talk. It would be really helpful if this author could write a book with a description of the standard language for each country and vocabulary lists for the most usual words. You could then look across. I am going to Australia, then I say this, I am going to Britain, then I say this, and so on 
 This book provides a good overview of reflections of the late Terence McKenna, a celebrated icon of the contemporary psychedelic scene and discussion, comparable perhaps with Timothy Leary in the 1960's.  For the curious reader, "Food of the Gods" offers a rich insight into his thought and its appeal. But that appeal turns out to be rather narrow and limited, unfortunately. Like Leary, McKenna commanded considerable attention, reaching a wide audience and achieving some degree of celebrity. But as reflected in the pages of this book, his analysis and views turn out to be surprisingly (I would even say disappointingly) weak, and fatally biased, with no solid substance.    I am sure McKenna must have been a very nice man from what people say, and I don't necessarily suspect he was a dishonest person.  Nor is he a bad writer.  But for a subject as interesting as the human impact of hallucinogenic fungi, the discussion McKenna offers here leaves a lot to be desired.  He tends to jump precipitously to his conclusions, and tries to support his arguments by speculation, often idle in nature, and rarely qualified with any semblance of scholarly rigor. This is surprising (and again, disappointing) because he is apparently well educated.    For example, the glare of Lamarcke's error is blinding in McKenna's speculations that psilocybin mushrooms may have catalyzed the very evolution of our species from its hominid ancestry. This is a good example of the kind of thought that seems to have excited so many readers of McKenna's works.  But if you have a minimally sound understanding of the idea of natural selection, its actually a little bit insulting to your intelligence (not that I think he meant it to be).  McKenna's thesis of the extraterrestrial origin of Stropharia cubensis gleefully throws any and all pretense of informed reason to the wind, and I'm sure that's a lot of fun--but only in a cartoony, conceptually childish way.   Readers seeking a more balanced understanding about psilocybin mushrooms will scratch their heads at how oblivious McKenna seems to findings from science.  To me his writings recall "scientific creationists" and their style of argument.  In fact, along these lines, one of the worst flaws in this book is its stifling, overbearing, disaffecting ideological rigidity.  It is almost like what one sometimes sees in "creationism" but of opposite, left-wing rather than right-wing, character.  The more different, the more the same? This is hokey, corny stuff, and actually not interesting, unless you are really into, well, overt propaganda really, about the "partnership" society of prehistory, and the "dominator" culture, and ... it just goes off into this sort of hambone rhetorical bait for anyone who will snap at it.  Here, a lot of fashionable, widely circulating fairy tales about prehistory and pre-industrialized culture are installed at the foundation, where only a better informed theoretical perspective could serve.  Its Rousseau's "noble savage" all over again, with PC retooling.  (From my perspective, notions that other peoples are better or worse than we are, especially if they are really really different from us, probably tend to distort our image, and capacity for humane understanding, of both them and ourselves, sooner or later).  One seeks in vain for a connection of any significance in this book to the prior works of pioneers such as Huxley, Alan Watts, Huston Smith, and R. Gordon Wasson, whose comments about the personal power and impact of their experiences with psilocybin mushrooms and/or similar agents are so insightful.  McKenna actually challenges Wasson's thesis about Soma, suggesting it was not Amanita muscaria but ... you guessed it ... Stropharia cubensis.  And true to form, he offers nothing amounting to evidence, only a chain of poorly reasoned supposition and speculations--a far cry from the exhaustive research and painstaking studies upon which Wasson based his theory.   McKenna argues his ideas with all the passion he can muster, and perhaps this explains part of his appeal for some readers, especially if they share in his brand of polarized politics (note the unbridled enthusiasm on parade in many of the reviews posted here). So if firing your imagination with a lot of wild and wooly psychedelic surmises is your cup of tea, you will perhaps find this book entertaining.  Its really a dalliance in mental self-stimulation for anyone whose tastes it appeals to.  If a sound, well-informed perspective about a subject as important and interesting as ethnobotany is what you seek, well, this book is still good in that you can get a clear, detailed picture of the Terence McKenna phenomenon, and what it represents as a body of ideas or thought, what it is all about, the better for you to be able to evaluate its relative merits.    Apart from that, this is essentially an uninteresting book on a fascinating subject.  I would prefer to bear happier tidings, but "Food of the Gods" really fails to deliver a discussion worthy of the visionary promise of personal experiences with psilocybin mushrooms, compelling and glittering as that promise is.    But don't take my word for it, read the book and see for yourself what you think.  The good news is, if the king within it looks naked, you need not think there is anything wrong with you, even if you don't hear others around you mentioning this surprising fact. (BTW, McKenna's does have some good essays such as "Wasson's Literary Precursors" where his scholarship and writing can shine without being muddled by a lot of prank speculation, but they are not to be found in this book.)  
 As I was perusing the reviews to decide whether or not I wanted to purchase this book, one thing has struck me as strange. Has anyone noticed that all the five star reviews are from "a reader" and are written in basically the same style? All of them are very well-written, complete with proper grammar---the kind of correct grammar that only a professional writer uses. It's making me skeptical about the good reviews this book has recieved. 
 I have been studying Spanish for 7+ years and used this book as a text book in a college course that focused on the verb conjugations and tenses.  We did about 90% of the exercises in the book.  It's very thorough with the material that it covers, but the answers in the back are full of so many mistakes that the book almost isn't worth it.  It was frustrating for us students to use the book and check our answers only to find mistakes.  Eventually our professor stopped using the book.  
 I have been a big Rumpole fan every since the PBS series, and I thought I'd give one of Mortimer's other books a try. If he could strike gold with Horace Rumpole, why not with Lucy Purefoy? Unfortunately, no such luck.  	Lucinda Purefoy is a bishop's daughter recently graduated from college. She takes an advertising job, but something is missing, so she decides to volunteer for an organization called SCRAP, Social Carers, Reformers and Praeceptors, who help former prisoners readjust to society. That's how she meets Terry Keegan who's just done four years for breaking and entering. They fall in love.  	The conflict begins when Terry tries to explain to Lucy why he got into burglary in the first place. "It's not for the money," he says, "It's  the excitement." She wants to get closer to Terry so she decides to try it for herself. She begins by shoplifting. When Terry finds out about it, the roles are reversed. Now he's the one trying to get her to go straight.   	When Terry looks down his nose at her trivial efforts, she decides to increase the stakes. There lies the problem with the book. It's just not believable; it reads more like Bridget Jones's Diary than a crime caper. I would imagine Mortimer was trying to lampoon do-gooders here, but Lucy is such a dim bulb that the reader is constantly telling himself, "She can't be serious!"  	The minor characters are worse. Lucy's father the bishop is more liberal than Teddy Kennedy. When he finds out Lucy is sleeping with Terry, he's all for it. Also, when the leader of SCRAP resigns, they solicit Terry's criminal overseer, Chippy McGrath, to take his place. Mr. Markby, Terry's parole officer, is just as clueless. These people just don't measure up to the Rumpole characters. Somebody should have had the courage to tell this to Mr. Mortimer 
 I buy a lot of books from amazon, and I rarely make any comments. The material and style of this book are outdated, and it is vague on content. The authors should make a revised version, or the book should no longer be printed.  Bottom line, do not buy it! I am returning my copy. 
 I had purchased for my 9 year old (who is a very advanced reader and gifted student) the Usborne World History book.  She LOVED that book, and has read it cover to cover several times. I figured that the Usborne Science Encyclopedia would be similarly interesting to her.  Wrong.  She has barely touched the Science Encyclopedia.  The problem with the Science Encyclopedia is that it is very complex and written at a very high level. I wouldn't recommend it for a child less than 14 or 15 and maybe even beyond that.   However, as I have skimmed the book, it seems very good, good illustrations, good content.  Just not for younger kids 
 If you want a quick intro to Adam Smith, read the chapter on him in Heilbroner's "Wordly Philosophers," or read "How the Scots Invented the Modern World" to understand the context of his contribution.  There are also several larger competent discussions of Smith's books.  This book is a waste of time.  It has the usual Smith quotes and some unfamiliar ones too, and the discussion is sometimes helpful, but O'Rourke's attempts at humor range from cutesy to irrelevant to obnoxious.  Smith has aged well, O'Rourke has not.  At several points O'Rourke simply dismisses important elements of mainstream economic theory as confusing.  I thought a short book about Smith with his juicy quotes and some intelligent discussion of contemporary issues that prove his points couldn't possibly miss, but this one missed big time.  O'Rourke himself admits he's a sad imitation of Mencken.  If you want funny, read Mencken.  I hardly ever take books back for refund, but I'm asking for a refund on this one 
 I was looking forward to reading The Exorcist but I was let down. The book is boring it doesn't go into any real depth when it comes  to characters. The movie surpasses the book, I feel asleep while reading this book. Some people may feel that this book is scary but its only scary if you scare easily.   
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 Two-and-a-half stars.  In Requiem, Faulkner pens a sequel to his sensational novel Sanctuary, attempting to navigate the troubled marriage of Gowan and Temple Stevens. He delves deep into Temple's psyche, revealing a woman unable (or unwilling) to escape her troubled, violent past in Memphis. Just as her marriage is spiralling to destruction, Gowan and Temple's daughter dies at the hands of their nurse, Nancy. Faulkner seems to be trying to lend some serious philosophical weight to the otherwise lightweight Sanctuary. Two problems. First, Sanctuary was fine as it was; a sequel was unnecessary. Second, the narrative structure of Requiem--half prose, half play--while initially intriguing, ultimately hinders Faulkner is his attempt to probe psychological depths. (There's only so much of that you can do when you're limited to dialogue.) Oh, and of course that annoying ubiquitous allknowing lawyer Gavin Stevens has to put his $.02 in. I recommend this book only for true Faulkner lovers 
 I always buy Lonely Planet guides, but I am returning this one.  I tried to use it to plan my next trip to Paris in two weeks.  It's very frustrating.  The map is difficult to follow, and there is very few hotel information.   It also keeps referring to a map PP396-9 which doesn't exist (Try look up Museum Louve).  It does however has a lot of other cute-but-useless info .. for example .. where a straight guy can get his facial done.  Well, if you are into such things, get this guide.   I am returning mine 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 I bought this paper towel holder because I wanted an under cabinet model with a brushed stainless finish to go with our kitchen remodel.  The big problem:  when you tear off a paper towel, the whole roll comes off of the holder more times than not!  Very annoying.  We have only had it for about three months - my husband is so frustrated with it that he asked me to find a different one, and specifically asked that I post a review here so that others will not waste their time and money 
 I saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute, however, when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe. Very Very disappointed, I will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again. 
 I have read every book written about Stan Musial. I felt when I read this one the author was only interested in finding all the dirt he could find on this most wonderful person. I grew up watching this man play baseball. But most of all, I grew up watching a top rated human being. I really don't care about his personal life since I have met him many times and I don't have to have a book to tell the kind of person Stan Musial was or is. If you want to read dirt, than read Ball Four. That will keep you busy. If you want to read about a true baseball hero, I would suggest you read one of the other books about Stan Musial. They are what you could call real baseball books, ones by people know or knew the game 
 I got caught up with the pain of the sisters, but that soon gave way after a few chapters. The characters acted like whining children throughout almost the entire story. This was not an interesting followup to Baby of the Family. However, I do recommend Ansa's other works for they are well written and enjoyable reads 
 This is not one for the uncoordinated.  I only tried it once, and have no desire to try it again.  Also beware that this is not the best pick if you have only a small space.  
 It is hard to imagine William Hurt in a film that is absolutely terrible but he manages it in this lame vehicle.  He even has trouble maintaining a Southern accent throughout the film, sometimes using one, sometimes not.  Dennis Leary, the comic turned actor, is also wasted here but his onscreen time is very small.  The plot is that Hurt's daughter, a mute ten year old, witnesses a murder in Amsterdam.  For the rest of the movie, the villain's hit man tries to kill the girl.  Not only can this ten year old manage to constantly foil a "professional," but this hit man must have failed Hit Man School.  He absolutely cannot do anything right in carrying out his job and cannot even manage to own a gun that works properly.  Bottom line: steer clear of this one 
 I expected this book to be more than a workbook to supplement another textbook.  I was looking for something which actually provided content on Building, Measuring and Managing Brand Equity.  Maybe I misread the description of this book.  I was actually looking for the text of the main book in paperback format 
 I have tried. I really have. And I admire the writer but other than brief flashes in the hundred or so pages I read, the book is stultifyingly boring. There is a wonderful story here that gets so bogged down in continuous reportage and research; makes me wonder, what is the writer trying to hide, because what is so important about this story gets lost; obscured by the maddening overexplanation and baroque rendering of items,details,people and events. Is all this necessary? What do you leave in and what do you leave out? I would say, from what I read, leave out half of it. Talese, maybe it's his father's fault, wants to spend half a year, in reality it took him something like thirteen years to produce this book, making a custom made suit that he spends countless hours tearing out and restiching, redesigning, etc. What he ends up with is no better than something store bought. I think what is mainly missing from this work is an essentiall passion. Let me explain. I think Talese has it, or how else could he devote so much time and effort to this project, but he has successfully killed it. He gets so lost in his own brilliance that he fails to tell a good story. This is a dead book, kind'a like a beautiful flower preserved; the color faded,with no scent. The book doesn't live and I could'nt read it, and as any kind of example of creative non-fiction, or literary journalism, I have to go against most of the reviews of the book. I wouldn't call it a waste of time but I want something where the author hasn't killed the drama of the story with mortifying detail and unnecessary sidebars 
 ... if Howard Hawks was proud of making this. Sure Cary Grant didn't seem happy playing this part. I can't think of any good actor who'd enjoy being lured into such a preposterous plot which should have got Sheridan some Oscar for impersonating one of the most insufferable bitches on the screen (there's no shortage, but very few were less funny) although the responsibility is more Lederer's disappointing script.   This opinion is for the first 15 min. only, since I don't know if it gets better afterwards, but I couldn't stand it any longer : the last 5 min (of the 15) were an ordeal. 
 BPM is solution for all problem businesses facing today: from Snow White animation to unknown changes of next 50 years -- that's the description, comments, history reivew and the coclusion from Chapter one to Chapter nine. The "why" and "how" are missed. Too bad 
 story line: not for young kids, and not even really good for older kids. she has to try to fit in with the cool kids. whatever. i hate that an animated kid movie took on the teenage ideals of teenage movies. (!!!!!)  animation: sucks. was expecting every other barbie movie animation. those look amazing, this was verrrrrry poor 
 I am a big John Irving fan and have read almost all of his novels.  This book was a big disappointment for me, though.  Rather than deeply delve into the events and people who shaped his writing, Irving provides perfunctory descriptions of the major events in his life as a writer and wrestler.  He devotes much more attention to the scores of every wrestling match he ever took part in than to details regarding the process of crafting his novels.  For wrestling fans, this book might be just what you are looking for; for others, I would skip it and re-read Garp 
 This is my third heart rate monitor. I purchased this one because the battery died in my last HR watch. I thought I could replace the battery, but when I tried to replace it, I broke it. Oh well. . .   Anyway, I purchased the Reebok Fitness HR Watch because it was on sale (50% off retail). I couldn't find any reviews on it so I "rolled the dice."   With my two previous HR watches, it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions. With the Reebok HR watch, I had to read the instructions a couple of times. After a couple of training sessions, I began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings.   There are a few PROS on the Reebok HR watch:   (1) The chest heart rate strap will work with Precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors.  (2) The chest heart rate strap's battery is easily replaced. (I don't know about the watch.)   (3) It has a lot of features that you'll find in higher priced HR watches.   Now, the CONS:   (1) The heart rate reading is much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses.   (2) The shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it's difficult to read the small heart rate reading.   In conclusion, because the heart rate reading is too small and there's a glare, I can't read the watch unless I slow down, steady my arm, and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare. Because of this, I'm disappointed with this watch.   If you've got good eyesight, you can add 1-star 
 These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply 
 Because it is hardly about Updike at all.  And if you read it because you like Baker, I'd wager there is a very good chance you will like him less afterwards.  Baker comes across as a smarmy, smirking, egotistical, overreaching, worrisome irritating twit.  Maybe this is supposed to be funny; well, it isn't.  He came up with a stupid idea for an essay, and despite its shortness, it is stretched out and completely empty.  I read this book because it came to hand, and I am interested in Updike.  I finished it because it is so slight and quick a read, and I gave it numerous chances to turn around.  Certainly I should have known enough to stop when he announces that writing novels is really the purview of women and homosexual men, and that he and Updike succeed only despite the fact that they are heterosexual males.  Well, here's your opportunity to learn from my mistake: skip this thing.  This is a truly horrid, pointless little book 
 I received emails about delaying my order three times. Since it showed that the product was available, I didn't understand why I had to wait less than two months to get my order. I was so disappointed by the Amazon this time! Doing business like that, I am not sure how long you will survive 
 I was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it 
 I purchased this adaptor because the listing said it worked with all Tom Tom GPS navigators. To my surprise it did not fit my Tom Tom One GPS navigator and I ended up breaking the end of the adaptor trying to force it in. Look up the USB wall adaptor for the Tom Tom One and save the frustration of ordering the wrong adaptor 
 "Pause & Effect" is a mind-numbingly shallow book.  Practically every observation the author makes in this book is either completely obvious or obviously wrong.  Definitely NOT worth the money 
 I can't believe this book was even published.  Of course, I shouldn't be surprised since a lot of people who saw "Jaws" and eat shark fin soup are willing to believe that sharks are an evil fish, a "killing machine" just waiting to eat helpless swimmers.  What a crock....for all of the research that real scientists have done on sharks, this book pretty much erases all of the work that they have done to show what sharks really are...the top of the food chain. NO, sharks to not EAT people.  They mistake them for seals, sea lions, turtles.  Let us not forget that WE are in THEIR ocean...not the other way around.  Respect the animal and it will respect you 
 All of the E&E books I've read, including this one, are disappointing. They might be good if you haven't been attending class and need to learn the material for the first time. But I'm not sure why you would waste time on these vague materials if you have kept up in class. I recommend a more advanced study guide. Also, the Q&As at the end of the chapters are too verbose. Most of the answers are pages long, when they should be at most a few paragraphs, if not a few sentences 
 I was not impressed.  Even as a newcomer to triathlons, the book helped very little.  It had some motivation, but there are far better books for that out there, and very little useful training advice. My definate advice is not to get this book--- I still regret spending my money on this one 
 I was a bit dissapointed with this book, it was pretty un-organized, didn't have very much usefull information pertainting to the real estate exam, and didn't seem very helpfull... 
 I was very unimpressed when I opened this book. Im a lead guitarist and I've played for 8 years. This has no solo arrangements and not all the riffs are tabbed. I enjoyed the interview and thats about it. I probably learned about 3-5 song but I couldnt learn the whole song cuz none of the songs are tabbed all the way through. This is not worth your money 
 The information is incorrect!  You can't print this thing out!  Had I known that, I would've dropped the $8 on a paper copy 
 nothing really extraordinary here.  lots of slandering dark-skinned peoples with the word "savages" thereby excusing genocidal and land-grabbing actions by the more "civilized" Xtian believing "aryans" who of course have evolved beyond all that superstition by emblazoning their one true god on their only appropriate place of worship--dollar bills 
 Hard to read and very difficult to understand. Great for people who have a  hard time sleeping. Garrenteed to put you to sleep 
 Way too optimistic, reviving outdated theories of the '50s and '60s (esp Rostow), forgetting all about the reality of evil, corruption, injustice, both of the rich and of (leaders of) the poor and forgetting almost all about participation, empowerment and advocacy, assuming that macro scale economics are the same at micro (village) scale.  Just a small example: one of the main ideas in the book is: give villages a big push, so that they can start climbing the economic ladder. Increased economic activity leads to increased taxes which leads to increased public services, which helps increase economic activity. The first causal relation overlooks the fact that 80-90% (to sometimes 100%) of economic activities in African villages take place in the informal economy, where there are no official tax systems. The second causal relation overlooks (as said above) the fact of corruption. The example of Nigeria (enough income through oil exports, and corruption not mainly at the lower ranks but even at the very highest rank) shows that corruption is not a matter of need because of lack of money. The milleniumvillages approach is, as a friend of mine said 'thinking big inside the box'. I have not yet met people who have lived in an African village for an extended period of time (more than just a honeymoon time of 3 months) who believed Sachs' methods are workable. Is it a case of 'give it a try'? Well, you are working with people, impacting their mentality and worldview. It's not a business which if it goes bankrupt you just say 'I've tried, let's start another'. I agree though, with someone who said: Sachs is the best fundraiser of the age. he is performing well in that area 
 OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.  No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays 
 I found this book exremely biased, especially on its treatment of ethics and environmentalism, which were extremely collectivistic and altruistic. I felt like I was also overcharged for the text book, for something so  vaguely written 
 I am a big baseball fan, so I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This movie was very slow and it completely lost my attention. The combination of a strong cast and great original material (taken from the play) should have equaled a fun movie, I normally like movies like this, where the action takes place in one setting, this being a minor league ballpark.  Unfortunately I paid the price of my enthusiasm, this movie plodded along at a snail like pace, wasn't funny, and the plot was too unbelievable. The protagonists in the movie fight, bicker with their wives, and even fall in love, all within 2 hours of a baseball game. I recommend the play instead.  
 There's little more to say....great item, almost a "must have", but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal 
 Having loved both the Arthur Waley and Edward Seidensticker versions of The Tale of Genji as well as the bits and pieces of Murasaki Shikibu's classical Japanese I had hammered through as a graduate student in East Asian studies, I was thrilled to hear that someone had done a "stunning" new translation of this work I and so many other Genji fans regard as one of the greatest "novels" ever written. Fortunately, a friend of mine, who is also a Genji fan, had the foresight to forward me some random passages of the Tyler version before I actually shelled out any money. In comparing these quotes to the Waley and Seidensticker versions I was much surprised to find that the Tyler translation comes up short in almost every regard, and that even Seidensticker's version, engaging as it is, is somewhat disappointing. Compare their respective translations of this short passage from a scene in Chapter Five ("Murasaki"), where Genji is visiting a Buddhist monastery in the mountains:  Waley's version:  Genji felt very disconsolate. It had begun to rain; a cold wind blew across the hill, carrying with it the sound of a waterfall--audible till then as a gentle intermittent plashing, but now a mighty roar; and with it, somnolently rising and falling, mingled the monotonous chanting of the scriptures. Even the most unimpressionable nature would have been plunged into melancholy by such surroundings. How much the more so Prince Genji, as he lay sleepless on his bed, continually planning and counter-planning.   Seidensticker's version: Genji was not feeling well. A shower passed on a chilly mountain wind, and the sound of the waterfall was higher. Intermittently came a rather sleepy voice, solemn and somehow ominous, reading a sacred text. The most insensitive of men would have been aroused by the scene. Genji was unable to sleep.  Tyler's version:  Genji felt quite unwell, and besides, it was now raining a little, a cold mountain wind had set in to blow, and the pool beneath the waterfall had risen until the roar was louder than before. The eerie swelling and dying of somnolent voices chanting the scriptures could hardly fail in such a setting to move the most casual visitor. No wonder Genji, who had so much to ponder, could not sleep.  There is no doubt Waley embellished the text, but it was clearly in the interest of conveying a sense of the exquisite poetry of Murasaki's prose. His elevated diction lends just that touch of "class" we would expect to find in an author writing for an aristocratic audience for whom style was everything. Moreover, the sumptuous musicality of his phrasing continually underscores the melancholy atmosphere even as it seems to echo the sound of the waterfall and the chanting. Seidensticker's version has the virtue of concision, but his choice of words is often questionable: "reading," for example, suggests that Buddhist monks read the sutras in private meditation rather than chanted them as a group prayer. His "sacred texts," on the other hand, implies that Genji wasn't very familiar with Buddhism, which could hardly be further from the truth. It was as central to his life and worldview as Catholicism was to the Italian princes of the Middle Ages, as Waley's "scriptures" implies. The phrase "aroused by the scene" is even more ill-chosen, for it suggests that Genji found visits to mountain temples erotically stimulating, when in fact they tended to have the opposite effect, for they reminded him of the vanity of his secular pursuits, which were, by and large, erotic.   Tyler's version follows Waley's interpretation at this point and thus avoids these particular problems, but he has others that are even worse. His "a cold mountain wind had set in to blow," for example, is dreadfully clumsy and somewhat confusing, as is his "the pool beneath the waterfall had risen until the roar was louder than before". The latter illogically suggests that it was the increased height of the pool below the waterfall that made the roar louder rather than the increase in the volume of water flowing over the falls due to the rain that had passed. A good many phrases in the other passages I sampled from the Tyler volume had similar kinds of problems, which makes me wonder if Tyler's editors ever bothered to read the work they insist is so "stunning."  If any version deserves that praise it is Waley's, which may be difficult to find, but it is well worth the effort 
 Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are good, but Xenocide disappoints; in fact, Card could've ended on Speaker.  Instead he takes the worn path of Lusitania for his setting again.  In Xenocide, Ender must deal with numerous impossible tasks such as solving faster than light travel, averting the destruction of Lusitania by Starways Congress, stopping a war between the humans, piggies and formics, and saving the life of an electrically based lifeform, all the while contending with his messed up adopted family of geniuses.   And Card solves all these problems neatly.  What annoyed me most was Card's sudden use of italics to gain emphasis in speaking parts.  With such overuse of this device, I found myself giggling at the melodrama - and taken out of the story. Oh well.  Card, you've got talent, and I love Ender, but 'cide should've taken Ender to a new place 
 I found the humor to be somewhat arid.  I had trouble staying awake. Not recommended while driving 
 I've read scores of books about photo history and criticism but have rarely encountered such an unbearable load of relentlessly  postmodernist-deconstructionist-postcolonialist-genderbending cultural theory.  Certainly there is room for such perspectives and they may provide certain insights into certain photographic subject matter.  I welcome and applaud such efforts when they are well done.  But please, if occasionally a cigar is just a cigar, can't the same be true of a humble photograph?  Alas, no.  At least not to Clarke, who sees every photo as built on a foundation of past political incorrectness, which he proceeds to survey like an archeologist examining the strata of a Pompein latrine.  Viewing what purports to be the entirety of the history of photography in this monocular manner leaves us in this case with no history of photography at all.. 
 Men of a certain age will remember how, when we were kids and this was played on TV in the early 80s, we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed, and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops.  But those two over-the-top scenes are all this movie has going for it.    The other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable, especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter, and atop a parking structure, both of whom were in "can't miss" positions and missed anyway.    Moreover, if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly.  It involves Eastwood being sent from Phoenix to Las Vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to Arizona for a trial.  The witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the Phoenix police commissioner, and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup.  Assuming a material witness can be extradited, which I doubt, the crime appears to have been committed in Vegas, so it would tried in Vegas, not Phoenix.  And if the ADA prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner, he could just dismiss the case, and there would be no need to murder the witness.  The idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous.    In sum, the plot and the action were both absurd,and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus.  But those two scenes probably can't carry the entire movie for the average viewer.    
 Okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around.  There is supposedly some kind of moral to this story.  The only moral I can see is ...when you don't have a big enough brain, use your bod to get ahead.  Screw college, screw learning there is more to you then your looks... looks don't fade, they last forever!  (right)  My boyfriend doesn't understand why I don't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv.  Because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years;  being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want, being judged as nothing but a body and no more.  Any THINKING woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it, either.  It is not a good example for the young women of today.  
 I recieved this CD as a present, not thinking much about it since its southern rap  This CD has almost no lyrical talent  The reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the Neptunes.  Like almost all southern rap now, its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent.  So if your one of those clueless kids that like rap (mainstream rap) I would say you could possible enjoy this cd 
 This is one of the most horribly muddled "thrillers" I've ever read.  By the end, I wasn't sure who was "winning" or "losing," nor did I really care.  Clive better quit sub-contracting out his writing.  He should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on Dirk Pitt.  
 This DVD is a complete rip off, the performance is more focussed on Bonos sunglasses, with a camera in his sun glasses of all things, keep it simple and exciting, that means proper editing. Its oviuous this editor should'nt be editing any shows what so ever and needs lessons as to how to tell a story to an audience. We are not at the show, so stop trying to create an atmosphere, of swishing shots, because the atmosphere for the viewers is the flaming living room, and your job is to bring something into the room, not try and pull you in, with disasterous effects - what? A great big switch of OFF on the remote and a $13 dollar cash in at the second hand store. Thnak you very much - for Nothing 
 Getting the flashlight is a real problem.  After paying for expedited shipping on Dec 1, meaning Dec 8th -- at the latest -- arrival.  Still waiting on the 17th.  Called customer service, who promised to call back in 10 minutes.  Never heard back on status.  Filed a claim for reimbursement on the item 
 It's quite interesting in that is shows what makes the people of this nation tick, by looking at their traditions and examining their ideologies. It addresses the breakdown of traditional communities and human interactions. But the conclusions this book comes to should be quite horrifying to any RATIONAL Joe. The tone of the book is that we are all social animals that live, interact.... and work together in a community based on responsibility to care for others. It is true that we are social animals and that recently people have grown cold to each other...but the solution is not to enslave people with some "inherent responsibility" to others. The book's states that we will only become "human by accepting our essential poverty as a GIFT, and to share our material wealth with those in need."......this is the most anti-American book I've read which tries to fix the social climate in the most horrifying ways. This is SOCIALISM disguised as a Traditional American Way of Life 
 I bought the book to learn about starting an e-business..what I got was hand wringing over loss of so-called job security..boooorin 
 I was on a search to find a great oolong tea.  This set contained one somewhat weak black tea, two green teas, and a VERY strong jasmine. I much prefer black teas so tried one cup of each and then gave these away. Perhaps if you have a more exotic tea taste, this would be a better choice for you than it was for me. So far, the very inexpensive Bigelow oolong has come closest to a true oolong black cup of tea. 
 I read this book in the hopes of gaining a helpful framework for thinking about - and perhaps even achieving - my "number" for retirement, but that is not what I found between its covers.  Mostly the book concerns itself with the soul - searching and anguish that people who have 1 - 10 million dollar "nest eggs" go through in trying to decide if its enough to support them in the manner to which they have become accustomed, until such time as they pass on.  Although I really FEEL for these people, my financial situation is much more in sync with the run-of-the-mill American, and for us Mr. Eisenberg has barely a mention, let alone advice. On a positive note, I did find his writing style to be very engaging. Bottom line - I would have to recommend that you avoid this book and use the time saved to read something more useful and/or fun 
 There are two reasons why someone might deny the idea that Hitler and his colleagues intentionally murdered all those Eastern Jews: one is that you imagine that human beings are not capable of such hatefulness and sacrilege or two because you secretly (or openly) admire Hitler and what he stands for and you want to obscure the facts so that possible converts to your point of view won't be put off. David Irving is obviously one of the second group. Certainly, the mass poisoning of the old and weak, women and children in the millions reflects badly on political parties and philosophies. But saying the people died of typhus in the concentration camps isn't better.  It isn't less than murder. Anyway, I hadn't known much about holocaust denial and I thought this book would be a good way to learn about it. But actually it isn't. It's a rather tedious recounting of a silly trial, not a single character rises above the ordinary, nothing that happens is really worthy of note. Richard Evans, who was a witness, is an excellent historian, and I highly recommend his books, makes not much of an impression at all. We don't know what he thought and we would have liked to. It was disappointing.  
 This was the first Tami Hoag novel for me, and it will be my last. After reading such great reviews I expected more from this veteran author. What promised to be a murder mystery was, in fact, no mystery at all. After the first couple of chapters I had surmised "who done it," and by mid-novel I had wrapped up the rest of the so-called loose ends. This detective story is Mickey Spillane gone very long and very predictable 
 I was a little suspicious when I read all the amazing reviews.  I should have followed my hunch.  This book is mostly new age talk with no real advice (ie, "feel the blue and red flame of your inner love").  What am I supposed to do with that kind of advice?  If you're into that, good for you.  I'm gonna go look for some more practical advice 
 These canisters are such a disappointment.  They looked beautiful when I first bought them, but the finish has worn off just from sitting on my counter, and now they look terrible.  I finally bought canisters after many years of not having them, and I thought these would last. But they look dreadful 
 This video is terrible.  Trust me, there isn't a new position in this video that you won't already know about.  All the positions in this video are the very basic ones, and any ones that aren't basic are just plays off the basic positions.  Sometimes a leg was moved a little to the right or criss crossed.  There also aren't that many different positions in this DVD anyways.  It's too short.  All the other reviews keep saying that the actors are nice to look at.  In all reality who cares.  Your not buying this video for porn, and the actors really aren't all that good looking 
 The supplier {digital eyes} told it was available any more & they where going to tell Amazon  to give me cridit for the above item,but I have not heard anything from you ;can we resolve this matter ASAP,Thank You ,To 
 After buying and reading the book I realized that I need a lathe to make the gun. Lost my money! I think that the author should let the visitors know about that "little fact" before buying the book 
 Masturbatory crap that belongs in Penthouse Forum.  Young bachelor's bathroom reading.  Go buy something from Anais Nin or Henry Miller and skip this garbage 
 I liked the idea of John Edward writing about the rosary - especially to non-catholics b/c many miss the beautiful prayer that it the rosary. The background info on the origins of the rosary was simple and precise to those unfamiliar with it. The section on expanding one's prayer life was also a great way for anyone to work on one's prayer life.   However, John Edward constantly writes about how he is not preaching Catholicism and he is "not on the Vatican payroll." While I understand he does not want to offend some of his non-catholic followers, it really was tiresome for this Catholic to constantly read about. The constant onslaught of "I'm catholic, but I don't believe in everything catholic, and I am not preaching catholicism to you" overall turned me off the book.  The best thing to do is to go directly to the sections that deal with the rosary (historically and spiritually) and how to develop a prayer life based off of the rosary. 
 Clearly pretentious (read the introduction and you'll discover that the author writes that the "academy members are primarily craftspeople who don't possess the critical faculties and scholarly approach of cinephiles ..." hummmm), this guy -who pretends to be a cinephile- has preferred to write here a total personal statement, mainly leftist (but sometimes you wonder...), and clearly mean, against the Oscar ceremony,and the people who vote for them and, those who receive the little golden boy(see in example how he prefers to quote only the bad reviews and not one good concerning Braveheart, which made, by the way, a confortable $210,409,945) rather than giving the reader an objective work, written with distance and elegance. Maybe he has never been able to enter the industry he seems to hate so much, and instead of getting an Oscar, prefers to spend time criticizing it with his typing machine, forgetting how much it's easier than... winning an Oscar or doing a movie. (getting one star for the paper and the ink 
 We purchased the crib, armoire, & dresser w/ tower & it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us. Once we received it, we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely  cracked pieces. After inspecting them, we found that the dmg wasn't caused by packaging but, poor craftsmanship. Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun & some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed & continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes & used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's "cheaper" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs & I wish I could  attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly & would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture & the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board. Some of the solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece of wood, but 3 & they were glued together. We're currently trying to return this product for a full refund. We're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date. I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again. 
 I got this for my wife's new nano, but the new nanos are not rounded on the corners like the older ones, so the new ones WILL NOT FIT in this case.  I'll have to see if I can return it.  I am surprised Amazon is still listing this item 
 A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong.  Why not just make up a story with no historical basis 
 I take this title form the video store thinking in Wynton Marsalis. When I was watching the DVD I can appreciate that the image is very good (not great, and I have a 720p tube TV) and the sound is very good also(not great, I have a reference equipment). But the show is so boring¡ Look, you just desire this man stop to blow. The drum's solo is just awesome, but the rest of the show is to forgive about it 
 if you think you might learn something from the animals, you will be very disappointed 
 The first part of this 1997 edition covers material that is an "old hat". The rest of the topics are unnecessary, badly explained, too superficial, or unfocused. Don't waste your money, and your time 
 This book was a little TOO wordy for my taste. I am sure to ALL the FANS of the Hick's absolutely love it, however I did not. That's just my opinion. I am off to the next book. I prefer something that is straight to the point and lewss fluff, if you will. 
 I'm really very surprised that anyone liked this book at all.  How could anyone who likes Salinger's writing stand reading Alexander's terrible prose?  It is really painful, and that's just the starting point.  As others on this page have mentioned, the author has little or no understanding of Salinger's work (the example of his misunderstanding the story "Teddy" is a particularly good example, but the book is strewn with them).  Worse, the author isn't just ignorant but actually hostile to Salinger.  It's hard to understand why someone would take the time to write a book about someone he clearly dislikes.  If you must read this book out of curiousity, get it at the library.  I felt really ripped off after buying this book, and wished I had not given a nickle to this creepy author.  And if you are NOT familiar with Salinger, by all means do not read this book.  Read Salinger.  Your own speculation about the guy based on his fiction will make more sense that this so-called biography 
 I am leading a Christian study group using popular films.  I was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some Scriptural truth.  Unfortunately, the author was much less interested in a Christian message than to make sure he took every opportunity to insult the "church."  I know that churches have problems and hurt people, but it is not as common as this author seems to assert. He seems very angry at the church (and for some reason, all of western culture - especially America.)  Living in N. Ireland could make one suspicious of religion I assume, but despite his claims to be a Chrisitan so concerned about commmunity, he seems to enjoy tearing down more than teaching and building up. It is a good study of film (not movies - he definatley comes from a critical point of view and not that of an average person) but not very useful in the context of the church. That's my take anyway.  God bless 
 I bought this book the day it came out.  Dennis Lehane is one of my top 5 favorite authors.  What a letdown.  He is so talented I will buy his next book the day that it comes out, however this one does not showcase his talent.  
 I have taught computer applications such as Word, Excel, and Project for many years, but I rarely touch programming languages. This book appeared to be a solid fit: Build a Program Now! However, I simply couldn't connect with the author's style. The author seems to spend an entire page writing about a concept that could have been explained in a paragraph, but topics and code snippets that needed explanation were skipped completely. I have a hunch that Pelland had the perspective of, "Don't kill the newbie reader with crazy terminology; just tell them what to type." The end result, however, is code that works, but how & why it actually works is a Masonic secret. I would have REALLY benefited from an approach such as, "OK morons, here's a six line program that will add two numbers, and show the answer in a Message Box. Notice Line 1 does this. Line 2 creates a variable that does that. Line 3 uses the 'Show' command to blah blah." There was one section that had over 60 lines of code with virtually none of it described or defined. In short, I learned a few things, but the time was not spent well. I gave up about half way through the book after my ego required hospitalization 
 I was hoping to hear the rockin' spanish flavor of the Robert Rodriguez band Chingon, but what the hell is this?!!!   The Amazon recomendations lead me to this album, and hinde sight I should have read a little more before buying, but I was too excited to hear more of the Rodriguez Chingon. I hope this helps you 
 This is the worst book ever written. im serious. It does not make sense, it is really boring. Nothing happens, there is so much unneccesary writting. The author could have written the same information on just 100 pages. Do not buy this book. you will regret it . I repeat, you will regret it. Do not waste your money this book. Please look at other books instead. The author has written the book in a really stupid way. like right at the beggining, the protagonist recieves a grave letter from johhannesburg. Then his wike asks him what they should do about it. Then the protagonist responds DO ABOUT WHAT? then his wife says the letter of course. When I read this, I thought, Damn this book sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!! 
 Being a Saudi Arabian woman, I was totally amazed by the false information in this book. I don't think the author should write a book about a country when she lived there for few months. She missinterpreted so many things that happen regularly in our culture. She should know that women in Saudi Arabia choose to cover up. They are not forced to do so. The same thing goes to Catholic nuns, who choose to cover up for the sake of God. I think she should have talked to more educated Saudi women who could explain things better. She may have lived in a village where the majority were uneducated (that was in 1970's) and women were less fortunate. I'm currently working as an IT consultant in a huge company, my mother is a college professor and my father is really supportive and is proud of both of us. Nothing is stopping us from reaching our goals. I think people should look at a broader picture. I could have judged Americans by the acts of the KKK few decades ago. However, I lived in the US for two years with my husband, who is an engineer, and I had a chance to make good American friends. I cannot say all Americans are racists!! In concolusion, the book is a total waste of money. I do not recommend that anyone should buy it 
 "Mark's Handbook" is one of those books you hear other students in college talk about like it's a must have that you'll use for the rest of your life. But it's not. I bought this book, and six years out of college I barely ever crack it open. It's packed with information, but it's so general that you can't get any real-world specific information out of it. It's like a restaurant reviewer who can tell you that "New York has some great Italian restaurants" but doesn't give you the name of any of them. You're much better off skipping this book and buying one that's more specific to your particular field. As an example, the mechanical engineer is much better off with Shigley's "Mechanical Engineering Design" 
 Robin Hobb knows how to write well and proved it with Assassin's Apprentice. Unfortunately, she seems to be in love with her descriptive prose and forgets mundane items such as plot, action, and likable (or at least interesting) characters. Ship of Magic suffers from an excess of flowery prose adorning a dull, meandering story containing uninteresting and mostly unlikable characters. I read a quarter of the book and stopped. Some of the (mostly glowing) reviews claim that the book gets better, but my patience dwindled to naught.  Specific things I disliked:  1. Another Hobb book in which magic but inanimate objects (the wood of the liveship) come to life only after multiple people (three generations of ship owners, in this book) die while touching the object. Can't her magic creatures have lives and personalities of their own?  2. Teens and young adults rarely learn from mistakes and repeatedly act stupid. (Maybe they are all budding politicians.)  3. The interwoven story of sea serpents from some other plane of existence is distracting because of lack of context. It probably will make sense later, but it adds nothing but confusion in the early chapters. Hobb should have started the book at the middle or near-end of the story (so we would know the importance of the serpents and the liveships) and then gone back in time.  4. The members of the main family are mostly unlikable. The only likable one has unrealistic lines: the 13-year-old acolyte talks like a 50-year-old philosopher 
  I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course.  I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later.  The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive.  Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly.  It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid.  The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing.  The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.    I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico.  It sadly shows.   He has little understanding of Mexico.  I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work.  If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven. 
 I would not recommend this book for people who are trying to get their life together after a diagnosis of diabetes. I bought this book because its subtitle is "A Complete Guide to Planning, Shopping, Cooking, and Eating". It is none of those things.  I was particularly interested in the SHOPPING promise because I find that to be the most difficult part of managing my diet. Other books didn't have anything helpful, and despite its promise, this book doesn't either. One has to read through every single recipe, write down the ingredients of what you want to make, and then go out and get it. Just like every other book. So tell me: how does this help with "shopping"? I expected lists of basic staples in a diabetic's diet. There should be lists of "must-haves" for your pantry. This book lies about what it contains, and is sadly lacking in what it needs.  An expensive mistake, don't buy it 
 This book is absolute pulp fiction trash.  Charles Crenshaw is trying to "cash in" on the Kennedy assassination by writing a book about his recollections at Parkland Hospital on the day Kennedy was shot.  Crenshaw makes it sound like he was a major player in the trauma room where Kennedy was treated for his gunshot wounds, yet, the other doctors, including the doctor in charge of the case, cannot recall if Crenshaw was even in the room!  Clearly, Crenshaw is writing this book for the money, and not to blow the lid off the assassination.  It is a pathetic attempt to make money off a dead man.  Crenshaw brings up conspiracy issues of which he knows little or nothing.  He writes about the possibility that Oswald was picked up by Jack Ruby at the Texas Schoolbook Depository after teh shooting occurred!  This "truth" of Crenshaw's is based on the unreliable account of a Dallas policeman who later suffered a mental breakdown and killed himself.  How utterly ridiculous, yet, this is the kind of innuendo, lies, and half-truths that Crenshaw spins to make his book intriguing to the reader to sell more copies.  Crenshaw is a Kennedy assassination fraud and his fellow doctors at Parkland have said as much about him in other publications.    This book does nothing to advance research on the Kennedy assassination.  To the uninformed reader, it sends one down a path of conspiracy that is not provable nor feasible.  I'd give this book a negative star rating if I could.  Avoid it all all costs unless you want to read it for pure fiction, for that is what it is.    Jim "Konedog" Koenig, Kennedy Assassination Buf 
 As a vegan, I have tried just about every tofu product on the market, and nothing ever came close to the terrible texture of these noodles.  The smell when you opened the bag was not pleasant, but if you wash them off and parboil, that goes away, but is replaced with a slightly sweet smell that I disliked almost as much.  But I kept an open mind, cooked the noodles for a few minutes, added my favorite sauce and fresh ground pepper with some soy cheese grated on top.  Whoever said it was like eating rubber bands was exactly on target, they are incredibly chewy and just don't taste that great either. Even as a low calorie food, it seems like a waste to spend 40 calories on these noodles. 
 Director Michael Bay had some good ideas about blowing stuff up but absolutely no clue as to structuring an interesting, intelligent and engaging story. Even with blatently ripping off the far superior Tora! Tora! Tora! he still manages to produce this amazingly boring and inept clunker.   Why Hollywood has to shoehorn love stories into every second movie regardless of their subject matter is beyond me. Let's see Micheal Bay do a film with a love triangle about the atomic bomb. Couldn't get much worse than this. You can comfortably fast forward through three quaters of this movie and not miss much.   The second star is for blowing stuff up. Overall not a fine example of film making 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 Even great recepies with no pictures to show in how to present the food as a gift, end up been just a cook book 
 This book reveals the ideology behind new American unilateralism and the philosphy that underpins the Bush doctrine;  "Might is right" or machtpolitik.  Kagan's (sometimes sneering) analysis of the European world view is a simplistic one.  He contends that Europe favours diplomacy and international channels before military action not because that might be a altogether preferable way of conducting diplomacy, but rather because Europe is militarily weak.  Kagan assures us that, if the EU had the muscle of the USA, it would be as quick to dismiss internationalism and embrace a more militaristic and unilateralist foriegn policy, just like the USA does today.    In otherwords, European objections to the Iraq invasion were due, not over concern at the motivation for it and the shoddiness (now laid bare for all) of the intelligence that supported it, but simply that the EU doesn't have the military might to conduct such operations.  The benefit of hindsight illustrates how preposterous and, well, wrong, this idea is.  This is the central and oft repeated tenet of the book.  It would seem to me that the target audience for this book seems very much to be readers who already agree with current US policy.  The arguments are facile, hollow and repitious.  I cannot imagine it convincing anyone, not already of Kagan's persuasion.  Kagan refers to "Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction" as a pretext for military action with the same assured certainty with which he talks about how the EU is living in a fantasy paradise secured by American power.    Looking to the future he sees only decline for the EU as a power and continued dominance for the USA.  It is a measure of how flimsy some of the arguments in this book are that he fails at this point to even mention the gargantuan and record-smashing  defecits the USA is currently running as the Military Industrial complex gorges itself once again on taxpayer money.  It's a very short book, but gave me a better understanding of the dangerous views that are shaping the policies of the current administration 
 I admire and appreciate Ann Rinaldi's work, but i felt that this book was ill prepared and unoriginal.  This book wasn't very exciting or emotionally provoking.  The main character was trite and very redundant 
    As much as I loved the new characters in the book, I would have liked to have seen more of Darth Maul. There are often large gaps between his appearances. However, I realize it could be difficult to have him around all the time and keep it interesting. Maul can be a rather flat character if not used sparingly.   I also would have liked to have seen more background on Maul. Why does he hate the Jedi so much? How did he hook up with Sidious? What was his training like? Some is given on this, but not a lot. Most of that was told in the Darth Maul Journal, something many fans will probably not read. It should have been saved for this.   The timing of this book is also confusing. It takes place days, if not hours, before the Naboo blockade. The whole point of the novel is that the Sith don't want the Jedi to know about their existence or the blockade. However, just a couple of days later, they completely reveal themselves to the Jedi and their plans. If the events were so close to happening that they were almost unstoppable, why did they care if some little information broker tried to sell the info? If it had been months before, their concern would have been more understandable. The closeness in chronology kind of takes away from the urgency of the events in the book.   Final Thoughts:  Only read this book if you are a Darth Maul junkie.  If you read this book for any other reason, you will be let down.  Reading this book is not necessary to stay abreast of the Star Wars galaxy 
 The drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them, and I could not get the hooks to work.  I finally did get one  in place and hung a medium large picture on it, and it failed.  Far short of the maximum weight on the package.   In all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and I think whey would work fine for small and medium pics.  The laser tool that was included is neat and I used it for all of my pictures, which I had to hang with other hardware 
 I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did 
 I expected more, and better, from the ASPCA. This book is so basic, much too elementary for anyone who already owns a cat.  Really.  In two years I've learned more from my cats than this book could tell me.  The  information level is cursory, and in some cases, spotty.  It was published  in 1992, so there's NOTHING here about breakthrough medications for flea  and heartworm prophylaxis.  The only good thing to say about this book is  that the photographs are beautiful.  Wish I could send it back and buy  something more informative 
 This is not my favorite of Kathy Smith's DVDs.  I do generally enjoy her workouts, but with this this DVD I don't care for the extra long introductions (which you cannot skip over), and also the fact that she does cheesy voice overs for the workouts as opposed to talking throughout the routine.  Additionally, the music she chose is horrible, elevator music and not at all motivating.  I've done the workouts a few times but mostly this one is sitting on the shelf.  
 This anthology will serve those who don't care about the information that footnotes would provide, and those who already have that information in thier heads.   For students who want to give Swift a serious and informed reading, this edition is not ideal. Footnotes are few, and there's little editorial help in navigating the complex historical, political, and religious issues relevant to the text. Without an understanding of those issues the many of the works included are largely unintelligable and therefore a lot less interesting. For the price of a Norton, one expects a bit more padding to come with the text. 
 I give it 3 stars for porn and -2 stars for a movie, therefore, collectively; you have your single star.  By all means, I suggest you get yourself some hardcore porn, beat off, and then watch a real movie.  Caligula blows literally and royally.  It is a little under 3 hours, which seemed like 3 days, and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film.  The small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn.  The most triumphant scene in the movie is where the Roman soldiers attack the phallus-humbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro.  This movie is ridiculous.  In order to enjoy this, one must be completely perverted and dimwitted 
 back and forth and back and forth.  im happy.  im sad.  happy.  sad.  love him.  dont love him.  love him.  dont blah. blah blah.  we're poor.  we're not poor.  we're poor.   a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas.  malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive).    spoiler    he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok!  (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no.  when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok.  the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad.  in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)     
 While Dirk Vandewalle draws extensively from North's scholarly masterpiece on institutional development, his own work fails to break new ground on a provocative subject.  Very disappointing 
 I found this book very superficial for the most part. An exploration of George's spirituality is an interesting subject, but  there were so many errors in this book that I began to question what was fact or or fiction in discussions of George's spiritual life 
 I watched this movie and I don't review things very often but felt a need to save others from wasting two hours of their life watching this movie. This is one of the worst movies I have seen...painful...absolutely painful. Writing, acting, Directing all are some of the worst I have seen in a wide release movie. 
 The book has some useful information about J2EE here and there, but since this is a book serves a guidance for the SCEA exam, most of the contents are either too shallow or irrelevant for that purpose. Don't expect that you can rely on this book only and pass the exam.  There are some errors in the self check questions, but most of the time, the answers given are the oppsite of the correct answers to the question asked and I believe these are editing problems 
 Oone of the worst books I've started reading in quite a while. I didn't finish. How did this become a best seller? He shouts "look at how funny I am" and he's not. He shouts "look how strange and/or incompetent and/or incomprehensible the French are" without convincing me -- he's just another slagging Brit whingeing Pom. He also brags about all the girls he shags, and I don't care. It is, to go for the obvious here, merde 
 Ann Coulter is God's gift of literature! in Godless: The Church of Liberalism, she once again has published a book that is so accurate, so exposing, and so genius! She beautifully and intelligently exposes how liberalism is against everything that America stands for, and exposes how liberals claim to be tolerant of all peoples, yet they hate Christianity, our troops, and America (esp. Middle America). She is probably the most brilliant author of our time. If more people would read her books, Americans would be more educated about the disgusting and disgraceful truth about liberals and liberalism. Of course, since the release of her book, liberals like Joe Maguire, who have a brain the size of a peanut, are once again acting like the whiny little babies that they are. They can't stand the fact that she is so popular, and that what she says is so true! America-hating politicians such as Teddy the Swimmer, John Gold-Digger Kerry, Dick Turbin, Scary Reid, and Nancy Liberal Elitist Douchebag Pelosi, should be thrown in jail for treason against this country. They enjoy seeing our troops dying everyday, and they want them thrown in jail for protecting America. The modern Democratic Party actually wants the terrorists to win the war. Its too bad that liberals are decades out of tocuh with real America. They are still living in a 1960s mindset and they can't seem to get out of it. They just dont realize that America is a conservative country who hates liberals like them. God bless Ann Coutler and her art. ANN FOR PRESIDENT 
 This book has nothing common with the classical English style if you are looking for it. It has dark, gloomy and boring room photographs. But, it has a useful information in the introduction part as it explains the history and challenges in English decoration style from early periods until now 
 When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting "customers"(read victims) 
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 I paid what I would call a fairly high price for a blanket I could have gotten from a Discount club for half the price.  The photo is very misleading in that only the top and bottom edges are hemmed, the left/right sides are simply cut.  I expect this to disolve within 4 washes.  Will not buy from this manufacturer again 
 I purchased this book based on the mostly glowing reviews from other reviewers and I am very disappointed. The Arabic fonts used are SO small that, at times, it is actually quite difficult to make out the letters. Definitely, NOT a book for people who are new to the language 
 Ooo, I feel badly for reviewing this book this way, but... I really wasn't that impressed with High in the Clouds.  I thought it was full of oversimplifications, that the characters weren't well developed, and things happened in the book because it was convenient for them to happen.  From the start, I was put off - for example, Wirral's mother is killed when the bulldozers destroy the Woodland.  However, amidst the mayhem and carnage, Wirral is able to get his father's old raft, put his mother on it, and then decorate it with piles of flowers?  And even as this is going on, the forest is still being destroyed, with branches falling around him and others begging him to leave?  Not only is the story muddled, but the artwork doesn't represent this at all.  I felt that the personalities of the characters were very much stereotyped.  While the narrative has some fun asides, they often seemed to leave children out of the loop.  It seems that no one settled on a particular writing style for the entire story.  I really wish that more detail and revision had been put into this story - lots of the characters are very interesting, but we learn so little about them.  For example, what are some of the 101 reasons that Alfredo the flea hates Gretsch?  Why does Froggo have a wooden leg?  And why on earth would the animals leave their children with Gretsch as a babysitter?  I really did want to enjoy this book, but I felt that it was incomplete 
 Terrible read. Nothing new.  Elementary and useless.  DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME or $$.  Just how many cars has this author sold?  Hmmm, do as I say and not as I do.  Get a real jo 
 Okay, I'm sure a lot of you are going to be mad at me for giving this a low rating, but think about it. The only reason the Star Trek series it so over priced is because they know they can get away with it on all those hardcore fans out there. This is INSANE. Shows like 24, Stargate, Smallville, Buffy, Angel, and Andromeda don't cost nearly what these do. I loved this show. It was awesom, but I can't afford to pay over a hundred bucks for just one season, and I sure can't afford the 400 bucks they're asking for all the seasons. I can't believe they're able to get away with this. Almost every other show out there comes with just as much or more special features than these do and cost half or less. What are they burning these episodes to, Gold discs? I don't understand how people are able to pay for these without questioning "why?" I had waited untill the show was done to look into buying these, then I waited hoping the price would go down, but instead I find it's still costing way too much. Smallville on HD-DVD doesn't even cost this much and it's in HIGH DEF (beautiful by the way). I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to rate this product based on the ridiculous price it's being valued at 
 I really wanted this book to be better. I got this book after reading an excerpt from it in Outdoor Photographer magazine.  After reading the book I must say that I am a bit dissapointed. The problem is that the book tries to be all things to all people and really does not do a good job at anything.  For example the first half of the book deals with basic Photoshop 101 stuff. Things like levels, curves, crop, layers, selections etc. The only problem is that moderate to experienced Photoshop users (like myself) will find this a total waste of space, (which I could live with) but the problem is it is all presented at such a high level that novice users will find it totally useless.  The biggest issue however is that they did a VERY poor job with the layout of the book. The book has a lot of screen shots to show you various PS menus and workspaces and none of them are on the pages where they talk about it. You constantly have to flip ahead 2-3 pages to see the example. There are also many before and after shots of pictures processed with PS. It wouls have been really nice if they were on the same page, but once again you have to flip between pages.  The second half of the book does get a bit better, but I found I really wanted more.   If you get this book and you have at least a basic working knowledge of Photoshop you will probably learn a trick or two that will help you with your photography and it is really not all that expensive here on Amazon.  If you are new to photoshop you would be much better served elsewhere, like the many great books by Scoot Kelby  
 I must admit that this book really mystifies me.  There is no doubt that Ms. Bank is a talented writer, and there are many observations and characterizations that are vivid and humorous and ring true.  But overall, the novel just left me cold.  In thinking about it, I've come up with several issues.  First of all, who really cares about Sophie?  She just seems to have some missing pieces, and it's not really clear why.  She doesn't really seem to be able to engage in satisfactory work, relationships, friendships, and I can't figure out whether she lacks intelligence, sensitivity, and/or judgement.  But as a result, I really don't care much about what happens to her. Second, and more important, what the heck does happen to her?  The novel moves around in a way that makes me almost think it was written as a series of short stories.  You read all about her relationship, for example, with Neal, and then the next chapter arrives and we don't even know what happened.  Maybe I need more closure than Ms. Bank is prepared to offer and it's my problem.  But repeatedly, all of a sudden Sophie appears in a new job,or with a new boyfriend, or with new friends and I'm wondering - did I miss something?  Is this an abridged version or what? So that by the end, I have to ask - what's the point?  Has the main character grown, matured, been on a journey that has led somewhere, or what?  I was left feeling none of these, and thus pretty unsatisfied.  I just have to ask - why was the story of Sophie worth telling?  I have to answer - I don't think it was 
 I am appalled at the greed that Disney must have to milk out a classic like "The Absent Minded Professer". I found this to be one of the worst if not the worst remake of any movie. I found the plot to be too embelished as it made for the relationship between the characters played by Robin Williams and Marsha Gay-Hayden to be one of where it either tried to remake the safe and easy happy ending that's throughout all Disney movies, or it showed to be one where the parties had to wear their hearts out on their sleeves. I also feel that with the Character of "Flubber" it was a waste of time considering I don't remember any merchandising from the character. They should've stayed with the bouncing rubber balls from the original. I also feel that with the promotion of the Flubber substance that it was all shallow, and commericial as where in the original it was going to be put to good use in the military, and here it was to make a buck. I feel that there are some movies that are best to just be left in original state, and not be remade, and this is one of them. 
 I own all of Parker's books and wish I had not purchased this one. The subject matter was depressing and the "Jesse Stone and ex-wife storyline" is boring and repetitious.   The book is about pornography, incest & sexual perversion. I read about sexual abuse in my morning newspaper and hear about it on the nightly news every day. I read to escape for a few hours from all the media hype and to derive some enjoyment. "Sea Change" was a gloomy and bizarre reminder. I have thoroughly enjoyed the majority of Mr. Parker's books but this one was a major disappointment 
 While the premise of this diet plan has been around for countless decades, "Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper," please stop applauding this like the light bulb was just invented. While this book is generally pretty good, it is very much another glorified recipe book with some good tidbits.  Does this diet work? Of course, as this premise has been around for decades and is truly nothing new or revolutionary. Here is where a good book got bad-she claims that she lost over 100 pounds of fat in just 4 months by simply using the reverse diet.  Lets do the math on this monumental achievement: this would be an average of 20,440 calories per week or 2,920 calories per day that would have to be overcome.  Without several hours per day of mind-bogglingly intense exercise, this is absolutely mathematically impossible by simply dieting. Remember, to lose a pound of fat, you need to overcome 3,500 worth of calories. No one should thing that they can lose 6-7 pounds of fat per week by simply following a reverse diet. Again, this is impossible! This is great for some woman, but I still feel that the best combination for success is the Biggest Loser Cookbook combo with The Beer Drinkers Diet (the ultimate regular guy plan) available here on Amazon. 
 I usually love Patricia Cornwell's stuff but now it seems that she is getting so far away from her main character base that it all seems strange.  I am a funny reader and when I like something I like it to seem semi familiar.  This book felt odd and I didn't finish it. sorry 
 While it is true that this book reads like a novel, it is also true that it reads like one of the most poorly written novels I have ever forced myself to read. I say "forced myself" because the facts it contains on the Ingalls family are very interesting for someone who grew up on the books and television series. If you want to know about their real lives, this book provides that knowledge, in a round about way. If you can get past the cheesy 70's cover (complete with Laura in a low cut shirt gazing over her shoulder at a strapping, dimpled-chin version of Almanzo on the back), survive the writer's eternal conflict over whether he's writing a Harlequin romance novel or a pioneer biography, and wade through the repetitive use of the same gooey, sentimental phrases (I thought at one point that if he likened the rolling of the wagon to a lullaby one more time I was going to have to throw the book across the room), then this is the biography for you. The only good thing I can say without reservation is that it has great pictures. They are the only reason I didn't toss it when I was finally done 
 I have one other Weather Station from La Crosse that seems to work ok, but this thing is a paperweight as far as I am concerned. It shows that it is raining out when the sun is out! It constantly losses contact with the remote sensor and the temp and humidity seems to always be off. I have attempted to contact La Crosse, but as other reviewers have said, that is a lost cause. They never answer any emails regarding product help or issues, and no one seems to answer their phone either. Maybe I have a lemon, but I feel for what they charge for their products, La Crosse should be more responsive to their customers 
 This book is awful.  I had it for a DOE course.  The professor and the text were useless.  There were lots of useless derivations.  It was difficult to quickly look up equations or main points.  The author just blathered on and one.  USELESS!  I learned more from using google.com 
 If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it 
 I was very dissapointed with this release I never thought Id see the day when Flex went commercial but it happened and it happened in the worst way this album is the absolute worst commercial garbage I have ever heard sure if your a commercial MTV radio rap listener this is a five star album But this is what id expect from some one like DJ Clue not Funk Flex. The only good track is the Biggie Tupac freestyle. Flex really let the underground heads down on this one because after listening to mixtapes 1,2 and 3 which are all clasics numerous times I have to say that this album is the most unlistenable piece of trash that I have come across in quite some time. Where you at Flex have those clothing endorsements and corporate sponsorships gone to your head GET IT TOGETHER MAN!!!!!! WE NEED YOU!!!!!! Peace to all of the real reviewers who are not afraid to speak their minds when an album truly sucks 
 Perhaps the most outlandish and misguided book ever published on the  subject. Despite an appealing premise,  the writer fails to deliver  anything resembling a guide for a successful marriage.  In its place, we  get ultra-conservative hogwash that will surely doom any couple to an  unhappy marriage. Indeed, no self-respecting woman will tolerate a husband  who accepts Andelin's advice. Written by a dentist, the book recommends a  course of action that will prove more painful than a visit to his dental  office.  This book would make a hilarious read if it were not meant to  influence naive young men. Get "Letters to Philip" by Charlie  Shedd, or anything else on the subject, instead 
 Ok, I bit and bought a copy after seeing all the hype. I was disappointed to discover that it's not the book you are led to believe it is.  There's next to nothing in it about starting or running an online business. Now this is truly bizarre considering who the author is.   If you are looking at starting an old fashioned off-line type business, then it might be helpful. Suppose you wish to start a vacuum cleaner agency from your kitchen table or an mlm distributorship. Then I could see this being of some help. It's basically about all about dialling for donuts endlessly from home.  There's also very little of Gianforte in the book. Reading it you can't escape the conclusion that he farmed it out to his co-author, who then did all the work. Unfortunately the co-author is a journalist and not a businessman, so he focussed on the wrong things, in my opinion.  If you are looking at starting an online business, go with "Go Big or Go Home" by Wil Schroter. Now that's the book that deserves this one's hype 
 i need to have more in elaborat 
 The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.  Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.  A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.  I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph 
 I was disappointed with the book. I expected a book that would describe how to succeed in commercial real estate for someone wanting to buy and lease out commerical properties. This book hardly touched on the topics I wanted to learn about, such as what makes a property a good investment, how to do due diligence on a property when considering it for purchase, tips on finding a good investment and why it's so hard, pros and cons of development vs buying an existing building, etc. I would have appreciated if the front cover would have made the target audience clearer. Read the table of contents carefully before making the assumption I did! 
 I am a teacher that has taught for twelve years both in preschool and grade school. I bought this dvd for my son who is 17 months. He was born premature and is considered speech delayed and I was thinking that this dvd might help. I was very disappointed. This dvd is nothing other than moving flash cards. The screen shows several items and repeats the item's names over and over. I understand the concept, but it failed to keep my son's attention even when I sat and watched it with him trying to redirect him toward the t.v. The second and third time viewing he wouldn't watch it at all. This dvd is going up for sale on e-bay!   Save your money and just use real objects in your house in which your child shows interest. Point to those objects, play with them, and name them. This will be a much more meaningful experience for your child. If you are looking for entertaining dvds that hold a young child's attention try the Baby Einstein series or the Sesame Street sing-along dvds 
 My 9 year old son did not like this book.  He said, "you got me a book that says I hate Match, but then the author says that math is great. That makes no sense, Mom!"  He's tried to pick it up a couple of times, but it has not sparked his interest 
 Grossly over-priced and useless - Sony's $10 headphones sounded just as good.  The headphone fit in the ear s uncomfortable at best 
 Maybe even pro-Palestinian.  There is no doubt that anyone having problems with Yad Vashem (as this author does, arguing that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem should not have been included in the exhibit, never mind that he was a major reason Jews could not go to Palestine to escape the holocaust) has to be at least a bit anti-semitic and anti-Israel  There are other problems in this guide.  Having been in Israel many times before, I agree that this guide has many items other guides do not have.  But the tone and the bias of the author is hard to overlook.  I suggest you look elsewhere for a more balanced view.  All in my opinion, of course.  I'd have preferred giving it no stars.  
 It's TM for golfers with a Scotish accent.  Can't believe this book has a following 
 I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally,  after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and  suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option 
 What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
 As a devotee of Pride and Prejudice,I have read many sequels, including Berdoll's first, which I enjoyed. This book was a tedious, cliched, poorly written disappointment. A flimsy, unimaginative plot, repetitious to the extreme, with no depth to the characters. Enough about Darcy and Elizabeth's sex lives, we get it already!! Just how many different ways do we need to read about their libidos? Darcy and Elizabeth are reduced to either having or thinking about sex, and very little else. If you remove the sex, the 480 pages would probably reduce by a third. Also, the pretentious overuse of the words compleat, connexion, frisson, etc., were annoying to the point of distraction. Save your money 
 Recently I got into a conversation with the guy next to me on the plane about some of the memorable books we had each read in the past few years.  Unfortunately, I had to recall `Confidence'-easily the worst book I've read in years.  To describe it as disappointing is to go easy on Ms. Kanter.  It is far beyond that, and altogether abominable and embarrassing.  That such a prestigious business school like Harvard can tenure a professor who writes such insipid pablum boggles the mind.  Let's start with the central (and only) idea of the book--that winning begets winning and losing begets losing.  This of course strikes most people as fairly straightforward and unworthy of a book's worth of elaboration.  Yet Ms. Kanter tumbles all over herself to spell out the details: why this is the case (as if someone with an ounce of inferential ability couldn't figure it out in a couple of minutes), how it affects team morale, how it self-perpetuates, etc...  And worst of all, endless, endless, endless examples that do nothing or very little to elucidate; rather, they simply restate what has just been said.  And they restate and restate and restate.  Tautological (I think the word was invented in anticipation of this book), boring, tedious, insipid, stupid, unthoughtful, unenergetic, disengaged, disrespectful.  All these adjectives apply forcefully to the book.  Most of all, though, it is utterly uninventive and cliched.  Turn to any page and you'll find such gems of penetrating insight as (forgive me, but these are so funny I have to quote at length):   "Winning feels good, and good moods are contagious.  Success makes it easier to view events in a positive light, to generate optimism.  It produces energy and promotes morale.  It is easier to aim high and expect to reach the target."  (P. 29)  "Overcoming obstacles, leaping over hurdles, and recovering from fumbles can strengthen a team that has the discipline not to panic under pressure." (P. 71)  "Once the 'loser' label gets slapped on, those suffering losses are set up to fail.  They find it harder to get support, harder to get opportunities." (P. 115)  "Various turnaround tasks operate on different clocks.  Bold strokes are fast and can be done by one powerful person; long marches to change culture and behavior take more time and the commitment of many people.  Execution is play by play, game by game, while strategy is season by season..." (P. 178)  "People embodying the pathologies of the past can always be replaced, but eliminating the bad does not automatically produce the good.  It takes a major effort on the part of leaders to foster confidence that a demoralized company or group is capable of working together and succeeding at it.  Restoring people's (sic) confidence in one another requires four kinds of action..." (P. 241)  "Confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome, but what happens when outcomes are negative?  The dividing line between winning streaks and losing streaks is the choice of behavior in response to setbacks...  That decision to build rather than retreat, to rally rather than get discouraged, involves viewing setbacks through an optimistic lens, as an opportunity to learn and move on." (P. 357)  And it just goes on and on, mercilessly and cluelessly.   The wisest, most incisive business people read, study and think about far more than just sports and business.  I would recommend Ms. Kanter first enroll in a decent freshman-level literature or history seminar.  There she can learn to write and, with some effort on her part and perhaps a bit of luck, to formulate some imaginative approaches to problem-solving.  Beyond this bilge, I have had the good fortune to come across many books that have helped address confidence.  These are: selected essays by Montaigne and Emerson, `Hamlet', Whitman's "Song Of Myself", David Herbert Donald's biography `Lincoln', `Emotional Intelligence', `Flow', and Jack Welch's `Winning'.  `Confidence' inspires confidence only in the realization that you (no matter who you are) are at least intelligent enough to be the "Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor" at Harvard Business School 
 I bought this and it worked fine the first time that I used it.  Granted, it was late summer and the house was pretty warm so it was not to difficult to steam up the bedroom.  However, I have tried it in my infant's room 4 times this winter.  I used HOT water & salt to try to help it, but the darn thing does not have enough power to make the steam.  Maybe all of the "steam" energy is being used on the night light!  If you have your home's thermostat set under 78 degrees, do not waste your money on this item!  Find something stronger to get you through the winter months 
 this product is a mess. i cant believe it actually sterilizes bottles and nipples i ended up having to wash them and boil the old fashioned way it builds up nasty mineral deposits and it lets water out when you pick up the lid it really is flushing 50$ down the drain you need a whole role of bounty paper towels to clean after this jun 
 wow!!!Enigma is going worse in every new release after "The screen behind the mirrow" It's simple,there"s not enigma anymore... Im a fan of the old project,the real mystic enigma. I got all cds and every single from the begining... Sorry M.Cretu,but this is crap.. 
 I had to stop reading this book after about 60 pages, due to the exauhsting format of reading about everyone other than Patton. This book would be good for those with a lot of patience, and those that are interested in Patton's parent's, grand parents (as well as learning about their life, careers, likes/dislikes, ect)and the pain staking, very lengthy details of the background of every senario in Patton's life. I would simply like a very intriguing book, that gets to the damn point, but can keep my attention. 
 With due credit to James Patterson, this is only the second of his books that I have read with the first being The Jester. Everyone I know who reads James Patterson, raves about his writing so I've got to give this guy another chance as See How They Run is one of the worst books I've read. Actually, only a third of the way through, I was so bored and disgusted with the plot and charactors that I skimmed to the end just to see if the so-called incredible ending was as I had figured out early on. The charactors were unbelievable, the plot development uneven and the actual story was, in my opinion, in very bad taste 
 If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it.   Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.  Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others.   That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.       
 Nazareth is one of my favorites since 1975 when I heard "Hair of the Dog", their 5th album. But these "greatest hits" should've called "some greatest hits, some not at all" and I would slap the hands of people who composed this stuff... to not do that again. Only one third out of 18 songs deserves to be called "greatest", others are too far from that. It looks like  the compilation was assembled from whatever songs were available for the producer. This is a crappy approach which allows "novices" of Nazareth's fans to get easily disappointed. I have composed 3 (!) my own "greatest hits" CDs from Nazareth tunes... It seems the producers were not familiar with Nazareth's 30-year efforts at all. Only tunes 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 15 and maybe 18 may present Nazareth as one of the best groups in 70's thru 90's. Sad experience.. 
 Has the superior writing of Frank McCourt and Roddy Doyle opened the door for anyone to believe their memoirs are worthy of public interest? Dublin Made Me, is at best a watery account of Sheridan's childhood which fails  miserably to grip the reader and maintain interest.  This account is more  appropriate for bedtime anecdotes handed from father to child, than  anything even remotely comparable to the writings of McCourt and other  contemporaries.  If the reader is anticipating the rawness and vigor  associated with the accounts of others who have shown the best and the  worst of Dublin life, then they will be disappointed. A very forgettable  read 
 Nazi's secretly in LA with a blimp and a whole army?  This guy has a jet pack that shoots fire out of it, but it never burns him; it burns other things though. Totally stupid and wierd. There is this super tall guy who is like soooo strong he bends people in half. Jetpacked Germans taking over USA. Give me a break. 
 I was amazed at how gullible we are to a book like this.  Ultimately this mentality will end in another civil war with the slaughter of Americans again, (all of us).  How much blood must be spilled for the black man?  How much blood does it take to pay us back?  We are doomed if we cannot see through bitterness like this.  Enter the mainstream and leave the hate.  The white man feeds on our hate to prove us wrong.  If we are so interested in "getting ours" then why do we take two steps back with a man like Claud Anderson?  I was ashamed after reading this book 
 This book is as far from the title as you can get.  It's somewhere between Dr. Phil, an Einstein lecture and a Mensa meeting.  !0% of the writings related directly to the title, the other 90% was as far way as you can get.  That's where you should be from this book. 
 In Ethan Mordden's past books of the "Buddies" cycle books, the characters were superficial and the dialogue was glib. Nonetheless, the tales of his "outlandish" characters were a romp through "overly fictionalized" gay New York caricatures.  However, this fifth book and supposed conclusion to the series is a diaster. Initially, Mordden strays from his formula because it appears he now is an author who "Has a Point to Make," with overly simplified, pop-psychology analysis of gay life, with each of his supposed insights reduced to a three-point outline, as in "there are three types of gay love." Mordden then attempts to justify his ridiculous analysis by using his characters to illustrate the three types of gay love, to no success.  Despite the years that have supposedly transpired since the previous book in the series, the characters, nor the writing, have matured in the least. This book depicts New York gay life as vapid and superficial. As a former New Yorker, I can attest that while there are groups of vapid and superficial gay men (and straight people, for that matter), there are many more whose lives revolve around more than their CD collections and their gym-toned muscles.  One of characters goes on at length against gay marriage, with the author's character merely saying that it was a wonderfully passionate position for which he (the author) would receive hate mail. Consider this review as one of those pieces of hate mail. If Ethan Mordden doesn't want equal rights, then I don't have to purchase or read his books, particularly if they're as dreadful as "How's Your Romance?"  There is no plotline to speak of ... just a series of unconnected vignettes ... with no resolution or conclusion at the end of the book. Very disappointing!  
 This was the last Sedaris book I read, and I guess I was just spoiled by his other works.  Sedaris shines when regaling us with the autobiographical stories of his family, his boyfriend, or his experiences...just about everywhere.  His fictional offerings are a bit useless.  The charm of his dark, sardonic wit is in his skewed perspective of reality.  When this translates to fiction it loses its validity.  There's nothing funny about fake cynnicism.  Barrel Fever is mostly fictional short stories, so there's not much here that will captivate you.  The same could be said of Holidays On Ice but that book retains a fairly steady degree of humor and themes that redeem the fiction.  Go read "Naked" or "Dress Your Family in Cordury and Denim".  His later works are far superior to this 
 If there is one thing that rings true of the editor's review, it's that Robert Spencer is "lawyerly" - but not in the sense the editor meant, rather in the sense that he deliberately twists the facts in order to argue his case despite the facts.  This book is full of misquotations of the sayings of Muhammad (ahadith), and they are obviously deliberate as Mr. Spencer has taken the time to research the ahadith and yet still makes enormous errors in his rendering of them.  He spends a considerable amount of time quoting from the Bible and comparing his interpretation of the Christian doctrine (which I would guess a great many Christains will have issue with, as well) with what he claims to be the message of Islam.  He also spends a great deal of time attempting to assassinate the personality of Muhammad with the argument that Muhammad is the role model for all Muslims - hence by assasinating this personality he hopes to assasinate the character of Islam and all Muslims.  Despite his opening claim that he is not targeting all Muslims, the goal of his book, really, is to draw suspicion upon every Muslim in America from their non-Muslim neighbors.  His basic premise that Islam in essence is a falsehood and that all Muslims have deceived themselves with a backward and dated belief system that has failed to evolve, as he puts it, as Christianity has evolved from its backwardness by reducing the Bible to strictly metaphorical meanings.  The crux of his arguement is that Christianity is able to do this, because, as Christian scholars have shown, the Bible is in fact not the direct word of God,  but the Quran, on the other hand, is taken by Muslims as the direct, revealled word of God and hence there is little or no room for the religion to be re-interpreted.  If one reads (or listens, in the case of the audio book) carefully, though, it will not be hard to find the many instances in which Mr. Spencer contradcits himself.  All in all, it does read like a lawyer making his case in court, where it is Islam itself that is on trial.  Mr. Spencer seems to be trying to establish that the likes of Osama bin Laden are in fact   only following the letter of their religion, and hence Islam is a danger to be feared and reacted to preemtively.  Mr. Spencer seems to have strong political and religious motivations and is a far cry from his claim of being unbiased 
 I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o

 Giroux's book restates much of what he says in his other books (only with a few Disney anecdotes added). It took him two pages to say what could have been said in two sentences, and I found those same two pages popping up over and over again. I grew tired as I read, I was looking for substance. By the time I was half way through, I was skimming looking for him to say something new (he didn't)  If you're looking for dirt on Disney, read Schweizer's "Disney: The mouse betrayed" Schweizer's book includes documentation of a pedophile problem at Disney, lack of safety at Disneyworld, Eisner dirt, criminal activity, Disney's link to porn.. 
 Not only was this book offensive (see earlier reviews) but it is full of bad advice. For example, it actually tells women to never bring their kids to word! 
 You deluded people must be on crack AND antidepressants!  I purchased and listened to this CD with high hopes, given some of the enthusiastically positive reviews here.  Aside from the masturbatory pseudo-rapping and ridiculous and infantile chicken-klucking sound effects, and other miscellaneous and ridiculous utterances, there are some guitar moments where 'Buckethead' shows he can somewhat shred, but it ultimately all sounds the same and quite gimmicky.  Sure he can play fast, but he is most certainly NOT a world-class, STYLISTIC technical player like Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker, Alex Lifeson, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Glenn Tipton, Dave Murray, Akira Takasaki, Yngwie Malmsteen, Michael Romeo, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Rik Emmett, Brian May, etc. etc., just to name a few greats that 'blow away' KFC-head.  In fact, Buckethead is a cheesy, second-rate guitarist who pales in comparison to the world's masters!  I'm sorry, but he is BORING.  He plays nothing that hasn't been played or tried before.  Don't waste your money or time.  My copy is going to end up in my local retailer's 'bargain bin'!  And with good reason.  
 In this book Derek Fell takes a sensationalist, speculative approach to van Gogh's relationships with women, attempting to deconstruct them psychologically.  Speculation about van Gogh's life is inevitable, since there are many things we do not know or do not understand.  However, problems arise when the speculations in question have no basis in fact, or else are built upon erroneous information.  This book is positively riddled with both errors of fact (large and small) and unqualified speculation, severely damaging the author's credibility.  Given my limited space, I'll pick just two random examples to demonstrate the range.  Small: Fell cites at length (pp. 225-26) a letter describing van Gogh's funeral and says it was written by the journalist Albert [sic] Aurier.  Wrong.  It was written by the artist Emile Bernard TO Gabriel-Albert Aurier.  Large: On p. 173, Fell discusses the painting "First Steps," done while van Gogh was in the asylum at St-Remy.  Painted while van Gogh's sister-in-law was pregnant, Fell interprets the painting as van Gogh's fantasy of himself as the father of the child.  He does this through the painting's iconography, which depicts a man in a gardener's hat holding out his arms as a little child attempts to take its first steps from its mother to its father.  The man's hat looks like the hat van Gogh wore while working, Fell tells us, and he uses that resemblance to anchor his psychological interpretation of the painting.  What Fell does not say (maybe because he does not know?) is that this painting is van Gogh's copy after the painting "First Steps" by Millet-- the gardener's hat is Millet's motif, not van Gogh's.  Theo had sent Vincent a photograph of that Millet painting together with others in October 1889; Vincent (a longtime Millet fan) admired it so much he made a copy of it as he sometimes did with other paintings, particularly in the asylum when it was not always possible for him to go outside and find subjects.  Knowing this makes Fell's psychobabble analysis fall apart.   And there's speculation after speculation along that line.  Allegations that Theo physically abused Johanna; that Vincent carried on an affair with Marguerite Gachet and that's why he committed suicide, etc.  These kinds of things might --*might*--be acceptable if the book were a novel, but it's classified as nonfiction. That means it's just sloppy scholarship, the second most grievous sin of academic publishing (after plagiarism):  unverified information, hearsay, quotes taken out of context from letters, etc. (With reference to Marguerite Gachet, we're treated to more silly interpretations of paintings.)  When Fell does mention a source, it's usually some psychologist who I suspect doesn't know much more about Vincent than he does.   The danger of a book in a format like this one--without footnotes--is that the author is able to make errors and heap speculations without the reader knowing where he got his information (or didn't, as the case may be).  As a result, the unsuspecting reader with a casual interest in van Gogh might find him/herself believing what Fell has to say.  The pedigreed art historian and/or well-versed Vincent aficionado, however, will read this book, say "What??" on multiple occasions, turn to the bibliography to snicker at the gaping holes, and ultimately contemplate whether to use the book as a doorstop or a coaster, only because the spine is too bent to return it.  (The bit about a doorstop/coaster I have paraphrased from the cheesy 90s film "The Cutting Edge." I always cite my sources.)    As for Fell--he's described as an "art historian" on the back cover.  Allow me my own speculations based on the scholarly quality of this book: I'd venture a guess he either has no degree in art history at all, or certainly not an advanced one (M.A., Ph.D.).  I'm tired of unqualified people writing drivel about artists and paintings and calling themselves "art historians" (or publishers calling them that).  It's a professional insult to the rest of us who actually went to graduate school and built legitimate careers in the subject as professors, authors, etc.  Cease and desist!  
 I hate AC/DC, them and Metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department.  As musicians, these guys are very average AT BEST, most of the time, they're below average.  It doesn't matter if it's Bon Scott or Brian Johnson singing for them, AC/DC has always sucked.  Unlike other metal bands like Slayer and Sepultura, AC/DC's songs are very cheesy and boring, the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia.  Want real 80's metal (not glam)?  Go for Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, Exodus, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and many others 
 The only paragraphs worth reading are the once Heller got from other books, I'd suggest you'd read those if you want to know about the Tsangpo's history. Otherwise this book is a story written by a man who has little to no self-knowledge, but seems to know what Lindgren (the expedition leader) thinks and feels. Heller criticizes others but doesn't have the gut to look at his own actions. 
 When i bought the resistance bands i thought they were going to be much bigger than i thought. i havent used them since i bought them...i sent in a questionairre sort-of-deal back to the company i bought them from requesting an exchange, but i havent heard a thing from them. i'm not very pleased. 
 I think my title says it all. It was directionless and pointless. The only character that elicited any sympathy at all was Doug, and even he seemed to be drifting without any purpose. Even the gay issue failed to elicit any tension between the characters. I kept wondering when the plot would start, but it didn' 
 I guess I'm the only one who did not like this knife.  I have French, German, Swiss, Japanese, and Chinese knives.  This one falls into the Chinese variety.  I was not at all impressed with the quality of this knife.  When I compare it to a global (Japanese), it just looked cheap.  I sent it back and ordered a golbal 7" santuko, which cost more.  I just could not live with a Chinese knife for $70 
 This is a good primer for someone very new to the game. I would suggest Handicapping 101 by Brad Free as a better choice. I expected a bit better from Mr. Eng as he is certainly a respected and knowledgable handicapper. He may have been limited by the publisher 
 How can you know that you are really, really famous? One strong hint would be that people are willing--even happy--to pay good money for a reprint of your old emails. On that criterion, and based on the cheerful other reviews, Larry Niven is really, really famous.  Don't get me wrong; on my shelves are 22 books with Niven's name on the spine. But this one is a shoddy collection of castoffs, cobbled together not (I hope) by Niven himself, but by some marketing droid desperate to have some more Niven "product" to sell. It contains four actual stories totalling 100pp; the rest is trivial filler, including the above-mentioned printout of emails.  Those might be of interest to a PhD candidate in English writing a thesis on"Collaborative Methods In Science Fiction of the 1990s" -- but they are really for the wanna-be SF writer who wants to fantasize that he or she is among the lucky handful who actually get to collaborate with Larry Niven. In fact the emails are no more interesting than email between you and your co-workers. There's no writerly advice from Larry to his pals, no "here's the golden secret of good plotting." You could read a megabyte of such email and be not one adverb closer to publication of your work.  The rest of the trivia includes brief, uninteresting excerpts from novels; old, short, and dated essays; a report on a trip to an SF Con; a brief intro to someone else's book; and fragments of the "canon" (i.e. notes) on the milieu of the Man-Kzin Wars.  This stuff is just sweepings from the writer's office floor. They show you nothing of Niven's imagination or plotting skills. Their content would have near-zero interest but for the fact that they were not swept up from your office floor, but from Larry Niven's.  The editing is shoddy as well. There's no publication information at all (no citations for published items, no dates for unpublished ones). There's just no way to tell what has been published before, nor where. For example, half of the 100pp of actual fiction is a story, "Procrustes," but there's no hint that it was previously published as part of Crashlander (Ballantine, 1994). The lack of this data makes the book irritating to read (ok, when WAS this Intercon he reports on?), and useless as scholarly source material.  This book is for the library of an obsessive Niven completist collector. Ordinary readers will do well to save their $7 
 First of all, the only reason I started watching this movie was because my roommate got it and we're both lovers of the Romantics. The only reason I kept watching this movie after the first 5 minutes was because I could already tell it was going to be completely and totally awful and would make for a few good laughs between the two of us.  Beyond some very basic facts about the party of writers, this movie is not grounded anywhere in reality. The acting is way overdone and quickly becomes grating. There is no plot whatsoever to speak of and the movie lacks any sense of clear direction or purpose -- it is simply a collection of random, inexplicable, and nonsensical events filled with frenzied sexuality, animalism, and vaguely-defined hallucinations. While I'm sure the actual experience was not entirely tame and prudish, I find it hard to believe that this is anywhere close to being accurate. Even when it tries to delve into pseudo-philosophical discussion about the nature of love, fear, poetry etc., that you would expect to emerge among these great literary figures (which, strangely, does not happen often)it utterly fails to make any understandable conclusions or statements and their real views, beliefs, and visions become hysterical ravings rather than the passionate philosophies that they were. The film does not deal fully at all with Mary's creation of the Frankenstein story, nor do any of the other characters write ghost stories as Byron challenges them and as really took place. The idea that the story was born out of Mary's personal fears is an interesting one but this too spirals out of control and has almost nothing to do with Frankenstein.  The premise behind this disaster of a movie is a good one and I think with the right script, actors, and director it could be an amazing exploration of authorship, literary exploration and exchange, and this fascinating group of writers. That is not, however, what this film is.  P.S. If you do get seduced by the other reviews, pay particular attention to the scenes in the billiard room...I didn't know they had light bulbs in 1816!  
 I wonder how accurate the rest of the book is when the author, Mr. Kershaw, did not care to notice that Dawson City, the Klondike, and surrounding region are not in Alaska but well inside Canada. He makes these erroneous references often 
 I've been reading several books lately on American armor in the European theatre of WWII. This was the least interesting. The pictures are all of restored vehicles standing in museums or vacant lots. The information is mostly boring stuff about where it was manufactured, the type of engine, etc. There is nothing very relevant to how the tanks were used in combat. Books such as "Patton's Tank Drive" and "Patton and the Battle of the Bulge" provide much more interesting info and pictures 
 Mario was touted as the tenor who would overtake Josh Grogan and Andrea Bocelli. I don't think so. Nice voice and good background music but nothing exciting 
 The basic message was "trial and error" which, while it may be true, gives the reader no foundation upon which to build. Over and over, the authors related how professionals might approach a certain shot but that we needed to use trial and error to find how we should hit it, rather than to give some solid principle to begin to build our own process 
 On one hand, this book makes useful points and divorce and its impact on children and offers better alternatives. The problem with it is that most of the evidence is anecdotal. I don't think a lot of the problems the people in the book had were due to divorce, but to the way their parents handled the divorce. Many of them either leaned on their children too much for support or they went from giving their children attention and affection to ignoring them in favour of work and other mates. A lot of the problems could have been lessened with more care. Especially in the case of the fellow who had a congenital heart defect. He needed attention and help, he didn't need to be shunted off to the side. I'm also reading about attachment issues and how they can impact a person from the time they are a baby to an adult. If a person has to divorce, they should ask themselves if it is the right thing to do and if all other options have been exausted. Forcing people to stay together in a stagnating marriage seems a bit cruel to me, like in the case of the intact family she used as an example.  Also, I do not agree with her stating that children don't notice the tention and fighting in their family. They do. Children notice more than people give them credit for. Like so many experts she paints with too broad a brush. She uses too many generalizations. It lessens the impact of her argument. But, a lot of the advice she gives to the system could be used to make divorce easier on parents and children. Divorce isn't going away anytime soon, but, with responsibility and care perhaps it can be easier on children. It is hard for children to adapt to changes. I suggest looking at the advice she offers, but question her methods and conclusions 
 but the fact is, this book is absolutely terrible. the majority of the gossip girl books - with the exception of this one and the last one - were just fun, trashy reads, and that was fine, because at least something interesting happened in each one of them. but legitimately, these past two books were completely horrible. nothing happened at all. if you want to spend your money on something worthwhile, go for the a-list - i just finished the last one, and it was actually really good, as the other books in that series have been. but don't waste your money on this book. i just hope the next gossip girl will be better. maybe if von ziegesar writes the new book herself, it won't suck as hard as this one did 
 This book is entertaining at first, with multiple parallel stories. However, in the beginning of the second volume, it starts to get a little crazy. The protagonists are constantly drunk or eating mountains of meat. They are often crude and without reason, acting like bullies to those who do not sate their appetites. There are several events that make the protagonists extremely unlikable. It is outrageous how one of the protragonists would stick his neck out to help one organized crime boss over another, thinking that he is actually doing something righteous. In another instance that same character not only takes revenge on those who wronged, but also kills the women and children that live with them. He goes on to kill several more innocent people, and all the while gets off scott free. I just couldn't read anymore after that 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 Disappointing:- very bad quality reproductions of Wllies drawings and photographs,they are blured and lose much of the detail. Many amateur drawings clearly not by Willie.Only good pics. are on the cover 
 We ownded this for around 10 months but used it for just 5-7 hours. It stopped working all of the sudden (no power)  Sent it for warranty, (part no labor). $160 labor fee just to know what was wrong with it.  Would not but another camcorder from Panasonic (they even wanted me to pay for having it sent back) 
 The 30 second spot is dead.  The 30 second spot is dead!  THE 30 SECOND SPOT IS DEAD!  Alright, I get it already.  At least I did after the first 60 pages or so.  Unfortunately this book does not end at 60 pages.  Never have so many words been used to say so little.  The first third of this book (plus one chapter online) (parenthesis meant as a tribute to Jaffe) tells you why the 30 second spot is dead.  To illustrate the demise of the 30 second spot, Jaffe uses a dead horse and beats it repeatedly.  Perhaps Jaffe is quite funny and clever at a party, but his schtick gets a little old when trudging through 276 pages of his quips (plus one chapter online).  Jaffe fashions himself as a modern day Don Rickles, passing out insults to everything and everybody who uses a 30 second spot.  Unfortunately, this increases the page count of the book by about 90 pages.  The final two-thirds of the book is a survey of everything you can use instead of the 30 second spot.  Jaffe says you have 10 options and he has designed 10 little logos for each of them (which you can see on his website) (again parenthesis meant as a salute to Jaffe).  This is not any ground breaking information.  If you have been paying attention and made occasional contact with society, you will have realized that you can use the internet as a marketing tool.  Mostly, Jaffe's observations are re-hashes of stuff you can find in a trade journal or two.  And because this is an ADWEEK Book, I suspect most of this stuff was available in an ADWEEK article.  The important thing about this survey portion of the book is that it gives you very little insight on how to use these tools more effectively.  It's just Jaffe telling you that you are ignorant if you are not using his 10 alternatives to the 30 second spot.  Save yourself $20 and get a subscription to Adweek instead 
 Maxime Schwartz was a molecular biologist and is now a professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.  Schwartz traces the history of medical research into spongiform encephalopathies, and how the scientific understanding of how they are spread has changed over time.  If you know anything about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or Mad Cow disease, I don't think you'll learn anything new in this book.  How the Cows Turned Mad is not a sensational book, nor even a good book.  Quite simply it is too wordy and dull 
 I didn't read the book. I was looking for a serious biography of Hoover, after seeing Oliver Stone's primitive representation of a dark perverted homosexual in "Nixon". I thought : "well, it's 2006, this should be a serious object for research now". Looks like I'm wrong. The cover quotes Newsweek: "Eleanor Roosevelt was right. Hoover's FBI was American's Gestapo." Well, this is appalling. I know that Eleanor was a Gestapo specialist, as I know Newsweek is a well-documented contemporary history magazine. I mean, those are the ones you should trust when you look for information either on Gestapo, or Hoover. It means the FBI/Hoover deported Jews and tortured thousands of people, doesn't it ? Do I get the information right ?  I just don't get it: either there's no serious american historians of the 20th american history main characters ; or there is a liberal new order of things on such publications. Maybe there's another possibility, just tell me what's wrong here. Please 
 This book is a wrong book for regia aeronautica. I don't like that authors have had the very common idea of write another time with excesive criticism about techical level of italian airplane and logistic organization of regia aeronautica. This is a worst manner of paint our country 
 I bought the book for my girlfriend, but found myself without a book to read. I expected to find a nice account of a start-up (I love those kinds of books). I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter. The sugary sweet telling of what MIGHT be a true story; the silly and unrealistic situations; and the contrived dialogue, which I can't imagine coming out or a real person's mouth, forced me to put this down If you are a 14 year old girl you might be drawn to the story, but if you are looking for an business account of how the three dog bakery was started this won't be for you 
 I thought this case would be like the ipod cases I have seen that look like they are actually part of the ipod; it is not.  The case does not fit properly on the ipod and slips off the top leaving room for damage.  The belt clip is difficult to get on and off and the stand doesn't work well.  Overall I would not recomend this product 
 I received this blender for x-mas last year.  It has some nice design features (good heavy base to prevent tipping, measuring cup built into the cap).  However, I experienced the same problems that others here have -- the blender doesn't do well with anything thick like milkshakes.  It just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly, forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart.  While it worked OK for a while, the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months 
 The information contained in this book is very superficial.  It provides interesting content for about 15 minutes worth of reading.  If you are truly interested in a text on the traditions of Chinese New Year, keep searching and let me know when you have found on 
 400 small pages of mostly tediously boring one-liners, punchlines and other filler. No analysis of how luck works, or the science of probability. Ideal gift for someone you don't want to give a gift to 
 I love cozies and am very fond of the Miss Julia series.  I had to lower my rating of this book because there is a 98 page reminiscence in the middle of it that provides nothing new to the loyal reader of this series. That's about 1/3 of the book. Very disappointing. 
 It would be hard to express how irritating this book is.  The human voice is indeed an amazing instrument, but it is ill-served by the pop sociology, psychobabble, and profound disrespect for science contained in this book (along with a number of errors of fact).  A good work of popular science should find the interest in "dry" scientific findings and make them accessible to a broader audience, not disparage them in favor of man-in-the-street opinions.  I suggest Ms. Karpf rein in her adjectives and look harder for what science has to offer in her future works.  She will produce a more readable, more interesting product if she does 
 As with all my reviews, I just want to focus on the veterans issue. Like many right-wing war lovers, Rush never served. This shows.  Rush gives a totally ridiculous analogy about why men fight on page 15. After stating this idiocy, he concludes, "[e]verybody does what he is ordered to do because that is the nature of the military." And where did you get that idea, pray tell? I and others did what we had to do because we WANTED to do it. We had pride in service and pride in being elite. I wasn't a paratrooper and jumped out of planes because somebody told me to.  It is odd that Rush would refer to Representative Ron Dellums as "a former draft dodger." You have to turn to page 253 to see where I get mad about this guy. Regarding WWII, Rush states, "[y]oung men lied about their age, ignored medical and physical disqualifications, and abandoned their livelihoods in order to join the services." It is well known how Rush parlayed a correctable anal cyst into 4-F status to stay out of the military and Vietnam. I myself was also deemed 4-F, but obtained a waiver regarding my own physical disability, which was not correctable through simple surgery. Rush speaks of ironies on this about supposed Democrats, saying they would turn into "chicken hawks" (page 258) at the "first sign of trouble." Well, buddy, that was you on Vietnam. On that same page, he talks about Vietnam--the war I was in as a volunteer and he "volunteered" to stay out of.  Rush again forgets to look in the mirror after stating, on page 259, that the military has "unique requirements...no matter whose feelings get hurt, including heterosexual men who can't meet the physical or ment requirements." Since you did not meet the physical requirements (but could have with one short doctor visit), do you feel hurt, Mr. Limbaugh?  It also makes no sense, except in the context of people too cowardly or self-absorbed, his statement, "[r]ecruitment is down...and the intelligence level of those enlisting is lower." The easiest way to correct that problem is for all these right-wingers to go down and sign up. I really start to burn at the end of page 261. Check this out. "Most of us are so detached, so smug, and so far removed from the battlefields where our fathers fought...we cannot beging to empathize with them." Hey, my dad, granddad and me all got our OWN battlefields. He wags a finger at the reader with, "[d]on't ever forget the WWII generation, nor abandon the cause for which it sacrificed." Oh, puleeze, Rush, what about Korea and Vietnam? Got a problem with those of us who sacrificed fighting communism?  Rush reminds me of another fat windbag and draft dodger strutting around, making other men go out to do what he didn't have the guts to do himself: Benito Mussolini.  
 PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed!  Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem.  I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.  Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone 
 First of all this is a review that will help adults and young adults out the most, because younger kids who like horrors frequently enjoy horrors such as this one or the Grudge or the Ring. Now to the older people, this movie sucks it is one of the worst horrors I have ever seen. So I love horrors and I have seen a lot including the pg13 ones such as the Grudge and the Ring. Those two were descent back in the day but when comparing Pulse to them they look like the scariest movies ever. I have to admit there was only one scary part in this movie, but I wont give it away. It was also really annoying that the whole movie was in a blue tint so it was hard to get past that. And if you think that just because it is unrated that there will be blood and gore and extreme violence, YOURE WRONG. For those who love gorefest movies this isnt it, I know the front cover kind of looks that way but it isnt. I dont recall one scene of blood, the enemy was a virus through a computer and the acting was horrible. There was also the brilliant idea to add some humor into this movie, they said that this virus could get through any thing electronic so they covered everything in red duct tape to keep them from getting through, HAHAHAHHAHAHHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I beg who ever is reading this to not even rent this movie, it sucks, I made the worst mistake by buying this movi 
 I saw this movie on T.V. a few years ago, and since then I have bought the original Tarzan MGM movies.  This version is a pale reflection of the 1932 film.  There is no smouldering chemistry between Bo Derek and Miles O'Keeffe.  Her character moves from being an overly confident heiress to a bumbling, blushing little schoolgirl who is in a tizzy over Tarzan's "Innocent/Natural/Virgin" state. Her father, James Parker (Richard Harris) is portrayed as an outspoken, vulgar,sex crazed expatriate obsessed with the elephants' graveyard and any female he can find. O'Keeffe's gives a "wooden" performance as Tarzan.Three Chimpanzees and a lone Orangutan follows the "Lord of the Apes". If you are looking for a great performance by legends in the business, check out the b/w originals which for all their flaws, have lasted for decades.  If you just want to gape at Bo Derek half naked, this is the movie for you. 
 Briefly, the authors claim that the Egyptian  Book of the Dead contains information concerning a catastrophe that happened in 9792 BC, when the earth stopped its rotation and started to rotate in the opposite direction, causing the tidal wave that swamped Atlantis. The knowledge was carried to Egypt, where the Atlantean kings became the gods of Egyptian mythology. The knowledge of the catastrophe, and how to predict its future arrival, was encoded into the texts which were included in the collection known as  "The Book of Coming Forth by Day" (the Book of the Dead), but it was primarily guarded for posterity in The Labyrinth, which was purpose-built by the Atlantean descendants as an astronomical observatory. The authors claim that the Labyrinth was not destroyed, as claimed by the Egyptologists, but lies buried at a location they discovered by laying a sky-map over a map of Egypt, (with Giza as the belt of Orion), and projecting the Hyades star-group (known as "the labyrinth") onto the ground.   They also discovered that there was a retrograde loop of Venus in the year 9792 BC, that matches another one in 2012, and after finding it, discovered that the phenomenon was encoded into the Book of the Dead, as an astronomical signal that the catastrophe is at hand...so the forthcoming loop signifies a coming Atlantis-like flood in 2012!  However, their claims don't hold up to investigation! When the constellation of Orion is overlaid on a map of the Giza pyramids, the Hyades are not even in the same direction as the pyramid at Hawara, where the authors say the Labyrinth building is located.  What is more, there are actually 12 retrograde loops of Venus over the Orion constellation, between 1924 and 2012, due to the fact that a loop happens in a different place around the horizon over a  period of 8 years, forming a pentagram if the points are joined up...but the start-point of the pentagram moves by about 2.4 degrees each revolution. So, when the 12 loops are compared to the one in 9792 BC, it turns out that the most accurate repetition of the 9792 BC loop is the one that occurred in 1948...with no Atlantis cataclysm just after it!  These facts destroy the whole thesis of the book!  For the full review, with pictures, links and reply from the authors, go to the diagnosis2012 websit 
 I was quite sickened after finishing this book.  For some reason Mr. Feist has decided to debunk, destroy and remove almost all sense of mystique and continuity from certain major characters, his overall world/universe plot and the magic contained within the original 4 books.  I feel he has dishonored his characters, the story and the readers.  I so wish Jenny Wurts had co-wrote this for maybe we would have been spared this clumsy, lazy, unfathomable revision.  Almost all of the major 'reasons' we were led to believe at the end of the Riftwar saga were actually lies - oops sorry!    Poor Macros the Black - you were just an ordinary fraud with borrowed power and lies oozing out of every oriface.    Poor Dragon Lords - simply a tool of some mad genocidal god.  Poor Pug - you are destined to become the acceptable, palid, PC version of Macros forever being written to come up with reasons to justify not using your power.  Poor Thomas - hobbled in terms of power and without any real focus, purpose or point.  I think that Feist for personal and philosophical reasons felt he had to mess with his earlier mainly flawless creation and has ended up crafting something that is in all ways medicore by comparison.   What a pity.  I will stop here now and buy no more of his books and try very hard to forget I ever read this 
 considering that sex should be about as interesting a topic as there is, it really is amazing how so many writers can make it sooooo dull. are orgies really about as interesting as roofing a house? reading this author, it sure seems like it. what a disappointment this book was. not once did i achieve wood status while reading it. horrible. horrible. horrible. about as bad a book as i've ever read 
 Ah, another example of too much time and too big an axe to grind.  Sterling arguments this book makes:  1. DARE is a program established by "the man" to keep us down. There I was thinking it was a well-meaning but misguided government attempt to protect the people... Shows what I know.  2. The upper eschelon of society is a conspiracy formed to keep us from attaining social heights. But no one knows that. Not even them.  3. Funny cartoons make serious points more serious! Yay! If only they had perfected a book-version of those cards that play music when you open them. Perhaps the Benny Hill theme. Further, Perucci and cohorts openly admit at some points that their arguments make no sense and sink to giving the reader visual aides. Because pictures are the sign of a truly intelligent argument.  4. Timothy McVeigh and the Unabomber were misunderstood people who died trying to protect the American Dream, and the 9/11 terrorists were dishing out America's just desserts. Opened my eyes, really.  Read this book for a laugh, but don't expect much more 
 Don't be mislead, this is a theft case. The case comes empty without any memory at all. No body makes a 4 GB miniSD so don,t get be fooled by it 
 In this award-winning novel for young people, all the black people (with possibly one exception) are honest, kind, hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and good looking.  All the white people (with one or two exceptions) are cruel, dishonest, malevolent red-necks, who persecute the "colored people" for no reason at all.  Historically, there's some truth to the setting and events, and we all admit that blacks were sometimes persecuted in the past.  But that was then.  This is now.  Times have changed, but young people are still required to read this one-sided tripe.  Let's hope that English teachers will eventually recognize this poorly written novel for what it is. 
 First, I'll get the good out of the way, as this review is mainly criticizing Sevendusts' latest 2 albums, Next and Alpha.  But- to the bands credit, its great that Sevendust is doing what many others have never done... and thats starting out from their original hardcore roots (Self-titled, Home), evolving to explore their more melodic side (Animosity, Seasons), then reverting back to their true beginnings (Next, Alpha).  Sevendust has done all these things extremely well.  But something still seems lacking from their past 2 albums.  The issue here is that Sevendusts' ability to find their real sound has declined drastically since Clint has left the group.  The first 4 albums, despite being reviewed well or not so well, have always had a unique and complete sound.  For instance, the Self-Titled album is known for its in-your-face lyrics and heavy riffs.  But what made it a truly amazing piece of work is the fact that it also had choruses that struck you and got stuck in your head so well you that you couldn't get the songs out if you wanted to.  The raw heaviness, melodic choruses, the band's chemistry, morgan's amazing drumming, and the acoustics were all running on 4 cylinders.  Further, look  at Animosity (arguably their best album), and Seasons... some of the best acoustics ever recorded in my opinion... the band was on their A game.  So lets look at these past 2 albums... despite a few good tracks (Hero, Failure, Burn), Sevendusts' music has been getting progressively sloppier.  If you take someone who has never heard of Sevendust before and ask that individual to listen to all their albums, out of order.. they'd probably  place Next and Alpha chronologically as one of their firsts.. on par with "Home" (yea, you heard me right, "Home")... with Seasons and Animosity as their most mature and most developed.  This shows just how much Clint provided for this band.  He was basically the melodic and acoustic brains for the group.  In his absence, i've been hearing Morgan getting a lot more "scream-time".  I, for one, really appreciated his screaming back on the earlier albums, when it was less often and more intense... but now after hearing it track after track.. each song sounds exactly the same as the other.  I love Burn.. but the rest i just sort of like or honestly just can't listen to.    I'm not writing this because i hate the band.  Sevendust has always been and will always be one of my favorite groups.  Save your money and just download Burn off Itunes 
 of stupidity! smoke on the water have the most stupid guitar rif of the rock history, boring boring boring, but if you like it ok 
 hes got two albums out. WAY TO SIMULAR.. buy one and forget the other, Pretty much the same songs.waste of mone 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 As a writer of this time period, I thought this book would be useful to flesh-out my work and keep it as historically accurate as possible.  In this respect, I think it does a marginal job.  Most of my interest centres upon Britain and this book mainly focuses on the US (and not just urban locations such as New England, but the frontier states too).  So I suppose if you're looking for more European-based information it would be best to procure a different text.  The book is organised in a unique way, with such chapters as "Slang," "Around the House," and "Out on the Range."  Each of these chapters breaks down into a glossary of useful words and phrases pertaining to the chapter.  Sadly, the glossary represents the extent of the chapter.    Little of the text works chronologically, which really doesn't make sense for such sections as "Clothing and Fashion."  Block text would actually be more useful in this section.  Illustrations would help too, but there really aren't any.  The entries are relatively cursory and superficial; this work probably best functions as a jumping-off point, but you'll probably want to buy additional books to describe your characters' clothing.  In total, this book offers good "bite" definitions for pertinent words and historical concepts, but that's about it.  It's more of a simple dictionary than an in-depth encyclopaedia 
 I found very few dirty little secrets. It's a fun title that doesn"t deliver. Lots of dry statistics that are shuffled, dealt, reshuffled & dealt again & again. I may have a superior attitude about what I read concerning World War II. But it is my recreation. It must inform or interest or amuse me. This book fails on all accounts. I turned every page to give it a fair chance & it was a wasted effort. This book may have its place. If the reader is not ever going to read another book on World War II it's okay. That MacArthur & Churchill & FDR are related (how?) & that you can't fart at 30,000 feat are examples of the factoids in this book. It has tipped me off to avoid all the other Dirty Little Secrets book in this series 
 So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing.   Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!! I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!!  I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa! It was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That's IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That's it.   If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.   If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie... There was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....   Oh, and the story line?  What was it again????   Yeah... I love movies, good ones and bad ones. But this one???  The WORST movie I have seen so far...  To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing.  Hopefully, someday, there will be 
 This flick is like a prequel to "Hogan's Heroes."  The Allied POWs are plucky, cocky and handsome.  The German soldiers who guard them are bumbling oafs.  At the end of the movie the German guns come out and many of the POWs are slaughtered.  Disgusting 
 I'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with.  However, my public library has a limited selection of audio books, so I take what I can get.  I am a voracious reader, and I listen to audios to get more "reading" in, as you can listen and do other things.  I much prefer the Lillian Jackson Braun "cat" books, at least there is some humor, and I like the "mystery" part of these books better than Deaver's.  Sorry to all the Deaver fan's out there...I HAVE enjoyed a few of his books, but I get tired of the "same ole-same ole" 
 I got this pitcher about 5 months ago and sure enough I ran into the same leaking problems like everyone else. I should have checked    up on this pitcher before the purchase from Target. Good thing my mom bought it and not me 
 The space between the strands is much greater than shown in the picture.  The cutrain will not hide what is behind it 
 I ordered this the night of the Oscars. I will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy. There wasn't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging. It looks like a bad VHS transfer. I should have returned it, but it would've been more trouble than it was worth. I thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be - but unfortunately, in my case, I have to add: buyer beware.  
 While the book itself is great, and shows how to build an "industrial (almost)strength" type machine, the required complexity and construction, are beyond the ability of many hobbyists (as well as being relatively expensive). In particular, it requires welding and fabrication skills not generally available to the home hobbyist. Having said that, there is much to be learned, and using some of instructions and resources in the book, many people could easily build (as I intend) to build a somewhat simpler version, than is shown in this book 
 okay i've been trained both in sociology and philosophy and would say the book brings the poorest of both worlds.. never believed in intellectual history in general, but this kind of book, with its judgements about Kierkeggardian or Wittgensteinian 'individualism' as a 'natural pathology' of early twentieth century continental bourgeoise society, does nothing but buttress the self-complacency of our now liberal societies. Therefore despite some 'interesting' anectodes and impressions from Habsburg Vienna, the philosophical depth of the book doesnt go above our usual journalistic wisdom. I dont understand how other reviewers found this book brilliant or anything like that. I think recommendable as passtime only 
 Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed 
 Some photographers think what's erotic is what's hidden and left to the imagination. Two Thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing, leaving plenty to the imagination. Think of playboy magazine in the 1950's or Vogue or Madamoselle magazine today.  Many of these are stylistic, but not very erotic.  One in three of the photos in the book are erotic, not afraid of nudity. Don't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism. Instead get "Shaven Angels", "Natural Beauties", "100 Naked Girls", or "Crazy,Sexy Girls".  
 I was all set to have a great read. i'm familar with the settings and the job but i could not for life of me get past page 17. the characters are uninteresting; the plot is tedious and a bit complex, and it seems spiegelman is trying too hard to write film noirish, which he doesn't pull off. but i'm going to give it one more shot. i suspect all five star reviews here are from friends, which is okay. but the reality of the read is far different imho 
  The book does contain usefull information, but it left me with an awkward feeling after reading. It describes the 'typically Japanese things' from a personal western point of view, without explaining why, how, what, etc. -Japan is a weird and silly country, but there are nice temples-   Or is it the writer that is the culture shock ? If you want an objective book about Japan, keep searching 
 Every single one of you that gave blink 182's greatest hits a 1 star still liked them but didnt like the selection of songs they put on the greatest hits.......blink 182 sucks period.  thats all i have to say, thanks. love Andre 
 This story was very boring.  JK still writes much, much better than the many hack bestseller authors out there, but, considering his capabilities, this book was disappointing to me.  See his first eight or ten or so novels which, in my opinion, were infinitely more colorful, riveting, and original, and show the excellent work of which this author is capable 
 As mentioned previously, there is no cohesion in this book. The author arranges her tale in chronological chapters, but there is no order within any individual chapter. For example, she examines things that happened in 1945 before mentioning events that took place in 1939. This would be forgivable if there were any sense of drama to the proceedings - but there is none. Just anecdote after anecdote strung together like birds on a wire.  I hope it's this lackluster, anemic presentation that made me dislike Dorothy as the book ground on. Some attention is given to her politics, but much more of the book is focused on her love affairs, her dogs, her husbands, her inability to save money. She was a flawed woman, but the author presents her flaws without any attempt to get us to understand Parker.  Overall, this book was about 100 pages too long, written in a competent but bland style that presents facts instead of personality. Strangely, the only time Meade dropped her even-handed, respectful tone was in talking about Lillian Hellman. She writes about the actress with barely concealed contempt, as if Hellman had personally injured her. Maybe Meade should have written Hellman's bio, instead... she'd probably have brought more passion to the table 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 Valuable as a reference work.  Don't read it for pleasure or relaxatio 
 Jamie Foxx might be best known as a mediocre actor (with one good performance as "Ray.").  But now he can best known now as a mediocre singer/writer.  While he has a good voice, he's either corny or has no hooks.  Basically, there is no substance but he figures he can capitalize after the movie "Ray."  And to anyone who says that he can write good songs, let's look at a song and see his wonderful poetic lyrics:   Yo you sleep  Naw I just um, I think I want some more  Yea I know we just got through  But its just so good, I just caint help it tho'  Its something about your body  Naw it aint all I think about  Well to be honest, oh   Im startin' to believe,  Something's wrong wit me,  Cause everyday, every night, every hour, every minute  I'm thinkin' `bout it  I can be at my job, in my car, up in church  And when I try to pray it off, it won't work  It seems that I caint get enough of   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Its getting to the point where I (where I)  I watch it on TV when I buy DVDs  Thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases (39.99 for the new releases)  I aint proud of it, cause it's getting in the way of love for me  And I caint help it, caint shake it  (You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Some call it bad, some call it good  Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood  I do it hood (can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh   Some like it slow, some like it fast  It don't matter the tempo long as it lasts  I make it last (can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh    -Wow, that's a big pile of garbage!  Lyrics like that should easily win him a Grammy.  Keep it up, Jamie!  
 Stay away from these devices!  I bought 6 of them and 3 of them are already having problems, 1 unit alone has logged over 92 errors and I can't get imation to DO ANYTHING about it. They come with a 1 year warranty, you MUST email them for support.  I have emailed 20 times with no response.  If you call the IMATION HQ in Missouri, they will NOT accept support calls for this product, you MUST go though the email / website, so in my option I wasted over $600 on this product, it ain't worth $10.. 
 I only hope this doesn't signify the end of his career. Any time an artist begins consistently collaborating with "friends", it signals the end of a career. Look at Santana. The guy can't make a solo album anymore. This is what happened to John Lee Hooker. Musically, this albums lacks the care Clapton used to give his music. He used to be a careful, calculated musician who knew how to rock. Just bear this in mind if you buy the album. You may want to enjoy this CD with a 6-pack of ensure while wearing your favorite pair of Depends. And a members only jacket. Clapton just doesn't know what he wants on this album. Blues? Jazz? Easy Listening? Ho-Down Appalachian Stomp? Hee Haw? Crooner?   Eric, make up your mind. Then give us a cd worth a listen 
 I too ordered the "case" of bottles.  I received 16, not 48 and two of those were broken.  repeated attempts to get it fixed have gone unanswered! 
 provided little to no heat, and I live in Mississippi.  it wouldn't even take the December chill off.  definitly not worth the price.  i returned the Vornado and purchased a much less expensive Holmes heater which produces three times the heat 
 I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product. I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for "breaking in" the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process. However, I've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks.  I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them. Maybe some day they will be "broken" 
 This is a very poorly written book. There is no coherence to it, no direction, no real point 
 Richard II is most likely Shakespeare's dullest and most obscured play.  Of course, this is only the perspective of a sixteen year old student.  It does seem however to be a common trend among many of the readers.  This was  just one of six required summer readings for my Advance Placement  Literature course, and let me just state that under no other circumstances  would I have read this book.  And to tell you the truth, I didn't read the  book.  I purchased the audio cassette from "Amazon.com."  After  completing the tape for a second time, and only understanding a few words,  I decided to get my hands on the book itself.  The only difference that I  could notice was my ability to distinguish who was saying what.  I do not  recommend this book to anyone without a Ph. D.  Even to all of you literary  geniuses, good luck!  You will certainly need it to stay awake.  I hope I  was able to deliver a delightful and ever so typical sixteen year old's  response 
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 This is the second review I have done on this book. My first was never posted....hmmmm....I wonder why?     I am a loan officer. I bought this to see exactly what Reed was filling the general public's head with. Most of the book is geared toward a hatred and distrust of Mortgage Professionals.He tells you just enough to be dangerous, but not enough to really know what's going on.  He actually says that the Realtor is looking out for the clients best interest. Holy COW. What a bunch of crap...... Many of the real estate agents I have worked with are dishonest and fake. I have always tried to be honest an fair to all of my clients.... Usually the loan officer is stuck with saving the deal on a trumped up value the realtor has provided or one of the many other idiotic things that they do. How about laying the blame where it belongs. This book is filled with "dirty little secrets" Nothing you can't find on the internet. Not only that you'll have every bit of a hard time getting a realtor to disclose how much they make from a transaction. ......Many times two or three times what the loan officer makes. We have to disclose every cent.... This guy is a clown. Buy mortgages for dummies; at least there's no bias there. 
     Perhaps it is because I get extremely bored when I read "stream of conscious" types of books. This book simply bored me to death. The technique is written in prose form, I respect it, to some degrees, it is a type of art. However, the backcover of this book did a poor job of explaining what this book was supposed to convey. Maybe it is because there's nothing to review about! All said, this book showed the heart of evil as well as violence through the bleak characters of Popeye, Gowan and Red. They kidnapped the promiscous girl named Temple and took her to Memphis, where we meet a even more feared underground criminal gangs and bootleggars.       Overall, I'm really disappointed in this book because I thought that William Faulkner, one of the best writers in the last century, should've done better. A lot of has to do with the style that he writes in, but overall, a very boring book. 
 Do not like this product at all...the girls on the video are not facing the right way for easy instruction...we have to go the opposite way...very uncool...my daughter started crying, too...i told her it wasn't her fault...you want your child to feel good about themselves and all it does is make them feel like they aren't good enough...do not waste your money 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 First of all, when I think of someone in law enforcement or in a government involved job, especially negotiating, I think of someone really tough. With that kind of job, you have to be. The main character was an enormous whimp. In a book centered around a character in the middle of the crossfire and involved in a job as dangerous as negotiating, that is unacceptable. If she gets squeamish after only one job, well then, how'd she get where she was in the first place? Her negotiating tactics and attempts at talking with the bad guy were pathetic. Also in that horrendous scene was the moment when she met the main male character in the book. I never knew that I would gag so much in just a couple of paragraphs alone. On one side there's the author constantly praising the main characters so-called fearless attitude and on the other the guy in the story's doing the exact same thing. I found it all to be quite disgusting.   I didn't like the main character. And then there were the conversations: who talks like that? Everything about the entire story was so unrealistic, the plot, characters, storyline, dialogue...And it seemed as if every other paragraph they were getting something to eat. I have never read another book where they ate more. They ate more than I do in the time it takes me to read ten books, much less a single one.  I have noticed a pattern with Dee Henderson. Her female characters are always extremely dependant on their male heroes. They seem to turn to mush around them, so if you're looking for a strong female character, turn around and look somewhere else.    Overall: One of the most annoying books I have read in a long time 
 "The Day the World Went Away" was the leadoff single from "The Fragile" and is of minimal value to all but collectors.  Two of the tracks on this are taken straight from "The Fragile" (with small adjustments, one's slightly shorter, one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in), with the third (a remix) also being available on part two of the "We're In This Together" singles.  But looking at the songs themselves-- "The Day The World Went Away" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end.  The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong.  I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece.  "Starf***ers, Inc" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing.  Material aside, unless you're a completionist, you can skip this one 
 OK. So Universal, with an impressive library of Paramount movies from the 30s and 40s, and a less-impressive but still significant library of its own films from the classic era decides finally not to smoosh films onto DVD-18s like they are cattle, and give a more "proper" presentation" to some of the jewels in their vault.  So applause to them for even knowing that they own THE SIGN OF THE CROSS, and releasing the restoration that UCLA did on the film, along with some other notable DeMille classics in a multi-disc set (along with a rather boring turkey [FOUR FRIGHTENED PEOPLE}.   The marvelous Kevin Brownlow created an epic biography of DeMille, but is it to be found here? No.  Did Universal create any extras for this set? No.  Did they even try to find the 1960s TV special about the man?  No.  While it's commendable that instead of the annual re=release of FRANKENSTEIN or 16 CANDLES that they dug into their vault a bit, these acceptable transfers with no supplementary materials are pathetic compared to what kind of presentation they could, and should have been given.  ...which only means they'll be re-issued with proper extras in a year for less money!  
 The book gives a brief account of the experience of Chinese prostitutes in nineteenth-century San Francisco. During that period many Chinese women migrated to the United States and and sold their bodies for economic improvement. They daily encounter racism, discrimination, exploitation, and violence. The biggest weakness of the book is that all the facts are contradictary to the thesis. Although the author attempts to challenge the stereotype  of the Chinese prostitutes as hapless victims of economic, racial, and sexual exploitation, the stories in the book have failed to support its argument. Presenting only the misery and sufferings of the prostitutes at the hand of men, the excessive details of those immigrants' unpleasant experience in the American West contradict the thesis. There is no evidence of "unsubmissive women" in the book at all. It just reinforce the stereotype. Many portions of the book seem to be simply a collection of various unsorted episodes with no analysis. The research is incomplete. The author's incapability to read any document in Chinese has greatly hampered his research and also limited his knowledge about Chinese immigration history. In general, this is a poorly researched, weakly argued, carelessly written book. Agreeing with many other professional reviewers, I don't recommend this work to the general audience 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 This is like a precurser to the Beat movement of the 1950's. The sentences are overly long, it's written like  a police report so you become overly aware that there is a narrator which takes much away from the telling of the story. The characters are not interesting and the story is boring 
 What struck me as most peculiar about Daly's book is not the implied  desire to exterminate men -- that is to be expected --- but that women with  different viewpoints have also vanished from her perfect world 
 I am a big Brian Setzer fan going back to the Stray Cats. He quite frankly is one of the few artists out there whose music is just fun, lively, and makes you feel "Hey man, this is music". Setzer is as talented on the guitar as Jerry Lee Lewis is on the piano and in my mind no better compliment can be paid to a musician.   Every new iteration of Brian Setzer has been enjoyable: Stray cats, to the Swing of the Dirty Boogie, to the Rockabilly of the Comeback Special, and the superb tribute to sun records.  But, he missed it on this CD. The song writing is silly and sophmoric. I do not expect to find the meaning of life hidden behind the lyrics found in Setzer's CDs but the majority of songs on this CD have all the same elements. Some songs are riddled with rhymes children in the first grade use, and are repeated endlessly. Such as in the song "Bad Bad Girl in a Bad Bad World".   For example here is a small snippet out of the song mentioned before:   She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world It's so sad it's a sad sad world She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world She's a bad bad, bad bad, bad bad, bad bad girl  What garbage! By the end of the little chorus you just want to give the CD a toss.  Many of his songs are riddled with the disjointed tempo changes found in punk music. Setzer has been able to do this subtly in the past without calling attention to it, but there are a few songs on here that just sound confused. Definately not a Setzer trait.   There has never been a Setzer song that I absolutely cannot stand, until "Really Rockabilly" and "Bad Bad Girl". The first two bad songs he has done on the same disc. There is not one single song on here that compares favorably with any other of his songs that have come before.   I have to mention that I hold Setzer to a very high standard, which until now he has never fallen short of. This CD is still far better than 95% of the crap that is being released in today's market.  To summarize I would encourage Setzer to get beyond this CD, and return to his thrown a top the music landscape 
 This book is all about what went on behind the scenes concerning the lost gospel without knowing what the  gospel actually said. For me it was a waste of time and money 
 I bought this book after seeing Gary Null speaking on a PBS TV program. I was so impressed with his knowledge and the hope he offered in the anti-aging remedies he discussed and other valuable information he was offering in this book. I just couldn't wait to read it.  Unfortunately, after I purchased this book, I was very disappointed.  My strongest impression about the book was the very disorganized way it was prepared. There is a serious lack of appropriate catagorization and sequential arrangement of subject matter, topics, etc. It was hard for me to believe that Gary Null had anything to do with the preparation of the book.  I thought he had just mistakenly designated an unprofessional, inexperienced person to take on that responsibility for him.  After approximately 3 years, I'm still trying to understand his anti-aging program/s and the approach of implementing them. Its hard to make sense of a bunch of information randomly thrown together. Since then I have found  valuable books with practicle approaches for emplementing the anti-aging programs in them.  I recommend The Perricone Prescription, and The Wrinkle Cure by Nicholas Perricone M.D..  He has recently published additional anti-aging books, as well 
 Very disturbing book--on several counts. The flash backs in her other books orovided insight into the characters--how Beatrix had almost reached the point of no return, how Ian became a vampire, and why the poor guy needed counseling. All the flashbacks in this book provided was the fact that Stephan is a "bottom" without enough preservation to have a stopping point. I liked Ann, and I liked Stephan--in spite of the fact that he's an idiot. I wish Squires had spent more time on why someone who has lived for over 2000 years is too self-destructive to realize the so-called good guys are doing a head game on him.  Ann figured it out and she's been in an isolated area for 25 years. I also wanted more on Stephan's past--she dropped just enough hints to be annoying. On the whole, I thought two potentially good characters were wasted on nasty, destructive rape scenes 
 Having been fascinated by this subject since my first visit to Dachau in the 60's I thought this book would be a compilation of the "best and the brightest" but I was very wrong. There are a couple decent sections written by some fairly good academics, but some of them, especially the chapter written by Barbara Green, are just plain ridiculous in their analysis and conclusions. Her conclusion that Stalin's murder of millions of Ukrainians was not "genocide" is just silly. Not only that, her reading list is very incomplete in that it did not include eye witness accounts of how systematic the death sentence of starvation was actually carried out. The chapter by Stannard which compares the settlement of the USA over several centuries in an era long gone with Hitler's attempted extermination of the Jews and Gypsies is ludicrous. While he may make some interesting arguments, he ignores the reality of the cultures existing in the "New World" where human sacrifice was rampant, slavery and war-making were the norm, long before the Europeans showed up. Not a word about that in his analysis. He also equates the massive deaths of Indians by infectious diseases brought to the new world with the deaths in the Nazi concentration camps, which would mean that the AIDS epidemic which started in Africa makes all Africans the biggest perpetrators of genocidal death in the history of mankind according to his logic.  While this book is one of hundreds on the topic, it is not one that is worth the investment of time or money if you are interested in the subject. 
 Based on the novel The Big Arm by Clark Howard with a screenplay by Robert Roy Pool, this drama directed by Ben Bolt feels like an adaptation of a large canvas novel with all the detail left in, so that everything reads as subsidiary. Set in the Chicago of the 1950's, Matt Dillon stars as a dice player from Indiana seeking the big time. However, when you're juggling at least 4 plots it's only natural that not all of them will come together for a satisfying conclusion. The most promising one concerns Dillon's Hustler-like competition with Tommy Lee Jones as the owner of a strip club, with Jones having the same spot between the eyebrows as Dillon. The problem with filming dice is that the actual game is monotonous, so the best Bolt could do is create tension by delaying the next roll or the raising of financial stakes, though he does provide an early montage of Dillon with David Marshall Grant on a winning spree and falling dice and money to the sounds of Shake, Rattle and Roll on the soundtrack. The only other visual trick is the sparks of an overhead train on it's tracks as Dillon and Diane Lane as Jones' stripper wife kiss to Fever. The best of the screenplay is a laugh line of sarcasm and forboding given to Meg Hogarth as Dillon's mother re his dice mentor's funeral "I nearly got crushed in the crowd", and Cherry Jones as a Patsy Cline-like singer who sneaks up behind Dillon, covering his eyes with a guess who? Dillon says her perfume gives her away and she replies " Aint nobody gonna give me away but my daddy". This use of eyes and the eyes of the dice are also parallel with Bruce Dern as the husband of Lee Grant, Dillon's employer. Dern is a former dice champ who has been blinded, but unfortunately this plot point gets no payoff. Dillon is also given two romantic partners in Lane and Suzy Amis as a mother of a child out of wedlock. The madonna/whore dichotomy is rather obvious, and the symbolism worse, with Amis' child scoring points for her and the way Lane is presented so unflatteringly scores points against her. Lane's fan dance doesn't help, since the focus on the scen is more Dillon's twisted attraction/repulsion. The 1950's period works for Dillon's razor etched beauty, the perfect locale for his photographer Bruce Weber appeal, and he even gives a Method touch to the way he hits his own face with a restaurant menu. Watch for Lolita Davidovich as another of Jones' strip club entertainers 
 This is just a warning to anyone who may actually be thinking about buying this album.  KRS ONE is not a Christian, He did this CD to dupe actual Christians into listening to what his beliefs are.  If you didn't catch it, on the cover of the CD it says Temple of Hip Hop.. and not Temple of God, Hip Hop is a registered religion in which he is a Father/Co-Founder of along with Afrika Bambatta.  They are leaders of the Black Muslims also known as the  5% Nation.  This "Nation" actually believes that the Black man is God and the White man is the Devil.  So before anyone starts givin props to this man for Gods work, you should find out exactly which or what God he is working for.  You're either for Jesus or against him.. I haven't listened to this album completely, but I garauntee that he doesn't Mention the name of Jesus once, in fact in the first track after the intro all he does is brag and boast about how tight KRS One is.. and if he was a Christian then he would be humble.. but Like I said, he's not.. he's a 5% trying to fool the Christian community.  And Christians are Christ Followers because Christ is Lord and Savior... I hope this Review was helpful to somebod 
 Adrienne Rich has to be the most over-rated poet in history. Her work would be completely forgotten if it was judged as poetry, but because she has been adopted as the ideological idol of PC fanatics everywhere, she has become an untouchable icon of the present. Rich is best compared, intellectually, to the literary drudges of Soviet Russia, who extolled the glories of the people for the Communist Party. The diffrence, obviously, is that Rich is not embraced by the State, but by the buddy system that is academic feminism. This volume, complete with the breathless worship -- oh, sorry, critical scholarly attention -- of the editor, is a very fine presentation of what is, for all practical purposes, the work of a transient figure whose prominence is entirely dependent on the current PC state of the American academic establishment. If you wandered to this book because it claims to be poetry, why not skip it and try someone with some soul adn some real poetic talent 
 This book completely ignores the most important nonzero sums of a human male's life which are the amount of women a male mates with and the amount of children a male sires. Ignoring these two sums makes the theory Wright proposes collapse. 
 Even accepting that this book is targeted at very young readers, ABUELITA'S SECRET MATZAHS is sketchy in the way its story is told.   In fact, it is so sketchy that it virtually is worthless in conveying the history of those Jews who had hidden from Spain's Inquisition by concealing their religion.  There's a story here, an important story, but this author does not tell it. 
 This book is readable and interesting, with some expected advice and a few surprising ones. Especially interesting are his arguments against consuming all forms of animal-derived food including milk and his case against red wine.  However, anyone who knows anything about traditional Chinese medicine will see that Dr Smith can't be a serious practitioner or even a believer of TCM. Most TCM tonics contain animal parts. One of the most highly prized Chinese/Tibetan "herb" is cordyceps sinensis.  Medicinal wines are also a very important part of Chinese medicine. Chinese physicians believe that alcohol clears the body's channels and moves the qi. Delivered with certain herb combinations, alcohol enhances the therapeutic effects.  Ginseng is not a miracle herb. For the wrong body type, it can cause more harm than good. Osteoporosis is not well-documented in China. It doesn't mean it does not exist. In fact, rickets used to be quite common until school children were encouraged to drink milk.  There are a lot of other debatable points. Suffice to say that while this book makes an interesting read, one shouldn't take it too seriously 
 As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery 
 Why does this man enjoy a reputation as a medievalist? Why does he have tenure at a prestigious university? If I were to try to write a book about ancient history, I couldn't dumb it down enough to compete with this "professor's" endeavors. Read the first chapter and decide for yourself. I guess that Tom Wolfe is right about the current state of American college classrooms, if this Cantor is any indicator of what is being taught on campuses these days (I am Charlotte Simmons).   Then again, to the people who glean their inspiration from Dan Brown % co when it comes to history and learning, I suppose that Cantor seems a sage by comparison. If you haven't studied ancient societies one iota, this book will serve you well as an introduction. For anyobe else I would suggest about a dozen other books by way of introduction. Try your hand at Fernand Braudel's HISTORY OF CIVILAZATION, HG Wells' HISTORY OF THE WORLD, and of the Cambridge or Oxford World Hisories, etc. Just put this claptrap out of your mind and don't even bother perusing it, as I made the mistake in doing.   This is the second book from this "medievalist" I've reviewed. All I can say is that it must be a very easy task to get an A in a course he teaches at NYU. So if you you have a son or daughter taking courses there, make sure they sign up for one of his classes. No problem when it comes to outwitting the "professor." Sorry to be so mean, but when it comes to medieval and ancient history, I'm a nudge. I happen to be a big fan of both Herodotus and Gibbon. Professor Cantor is bush league in comparison. No excuses for shoddy scholarship in a field you are supposed to excell in.    BE 
 I picked up this book in the best-seller section and read the blurb: "Katie Wilkinson has finally found the perfect man - but one day he suddenly disappears, leaving behind only a diary written by a new mother named Suzanne for her baby, Nicholas.....As Katie reads on, she realizes that the man she loves is Suzanne's husband.  Now, filled with terror and hope, Katie must struggle to understand what has happened - and find out if her new love has a prayer of surviving."  Well, DUH.  It's a romance and Matt is the "perfect man."  OBVIOUSLY Suzanne and Nicholas are dead, and once Katie reads the diary her deepened love and understanding will help Matt to recover and they will live happily ever after.  But wait.  The quote at the top from the New York Times says, "The idea is to curl up and enjoy....you haven't guessed how this story ends."  Well, that's interesting.  If a New York Times reviewer didn't guess the ending, I must be wrong.  Then the quote on the front from People says "A love story as suspenseful as any thriller..."  Not as good a source as the NYT, but usually pretty reliable for beach reading books.  And although I had never read James Patterson, I knew he was more of a mystery or thriller type author.  Well, I thought, a love story/thriller with an ending that the NYT didn't see coming?  That sounds pretty good.  Well, if you love gushing romance, I guess this is pretty good (although I think even Harlequin's most romantic author would blush to submit some of this hogwash).  If you think there is the slightest mystery about the ending, there isn't.    Well, yes, there is one tiny surprise near the end, but it's a surprise only because the author unfairly manipulates the reader into believing that a certain fact is true.  Skillful manipulation of a reader is fine.  I have enjoyed many mysteries where the author has cleverly but fairly led the reader to jump to the wrong conclusion.  However, this author blatantly shoves the reader to the wrong conclusion.  Therefore, it is a surprise when you realize the truth, but FAR more annoying than moving or sad or whatever it was supposed to be.  However, I think even if Amazon allowed zero stars, I would give this a one, because I do like The Five Balls metaphor 
 I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of MIMIC 2. After all, it was the direct-to-video sequel for a science fiction film that didn't do very well at the box office to begin with. However, even with my low expectations I was disappointed. The film started off well enough, having a minor character from the first film become the lead in this one. However, nothing exciting was done with the concept. Instead, the premise of the original was stretched as far as it would go beyond belief. The last remaining Judas bug knows its time is running out. So, it has to mate so the species will continue to survive. However, this bug evolved to the point where it adapted to mimic humans. Therefore, the only creature worthy of it mating with is a human. Get it? Pretty twisted, huh? Good. Now, don't waste your time watching this movie 
 Now that Hannity has gone on the record as a pedofilia apologist and defender of child molestation.   "Thank God for Hannity!" -Lee Krock, founder of NAMBL 
 I love the novels of George Eliot and am fascinated by her life, but was appalled to have to struggle to read this biography, which was dry and boring. I tried three times and still only got halfway through it. Now I'm off to find another biography of George Eliot that captures the essence of Eliot in tone and style as well as fact. Such a highly talented and insightful author who lived so daringly and unconventionally in Victorian times certainly deserves a biographer capable of making such an engaging life engaging to read. This one does not 
 Amartya Sen is a serious economist, who has some serious ideas, but they are not in this book.  The book purports to be an philosophical/economic argument for "freedom now" as both the means and the goal of economic and social policy, and an argument against the postponement of "freedom" until after "purely" economic development has occurred.    Freedom, Sen claims -and not merely wealth or the rule of law- is the best vehicle to promote...well...freedom itself.  If this reasoning sounds circular to you, you are not alone.  On one interpretation, this strikes me as trivially true.  Sure: promote freedom and you will indeed get freedom.  If, on the other hand, Sen is stating that freedom is "the solution" to global poverty, his thesis is dubious at best.  And this is especially so because Sen's book is NOT really a polemic against Confucian statism (i.e. the "Lee thesis"), it is a polemic against economic liberalism.  Lee is just a straw man used to advance Sen's more fundamental claim: that freedom -properly understood- is actually what he refers to as "capability."  In other words: freedom is not merely the absence of external constraints, but the capability to accomplish things in the world.  This is NOT "Development as Freedom" but rather "Freedom as Capability."  And this is where Sen really loses me.  Even IF "capability" is a quantifiable, measureable, controllable, predictable variable that can be maximized (extremely dubious, since the list of possible verbs of which one can be capable is practically infinite), this argument is nothing even remotely new.  Sen's allegedly groundbreaking discovery is simply the modern incarnation of Isaiah Berlin's "positive freedom," FDR's "freedom from want," and the other muddled reinventions of the concept of "freedom" which together date back to the early Counter-Enlightenment.    These ideas sound like doublethink because they are doublethink.  Public health care and make-work jobs simply do not leap to mind when one thinks of "freedom" - if they did, there would be no need for this book.  The conceptual epitome of "freedom" is one's release from prison.  That's not the necessarily the "capability" to do anything.  If we want to discuss welfare economics, on the other hand, that's fine -- but let's not confuse our students by misappropriating the language of liberty.  But I am not deterred from this work merely by the fact that I disagree with Sen's thesis.  In the end, I am turned off by the massive acclaim this book has recieved, despite its glaring intellectual mushiness.  Sen has supplanted Marx as the English professor's favorite economist, distracting attention from those thinkers whose ideas might actually make a modest difference in combating global poverty 
 This effort shows it's age. In addition, there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo-scientific method somewhat reminiscent of Mengele. I suppose it's possible for it to be taken as tongue-in-cheek by those at the post-graduate level of study at the Cheech and Chong School of Anthropology. However, I have to admit I was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing 
 I admire Ross Lowell's inventions enormously. His lights, while not as robust as others and so not so well suited to rental houses, are a great tool for the beginning owner-operator. I began with his Lowel Lights and moved up to his D-heads. I remember them all fondly, even though I no longer use them.  After many years as a director of photography,  I've begun to teach lighting and have been looking at book options for my students. So far the best book I've found on this topic is Blain Brown's "Motion Picture and Video Lighting". While the layout of Lowell's book is stunning, as are many of the images, Lowell approaches each section with long lists which to my mind do nothing to inspire the thinking eye.  With great respect for Lowell, I regretfully report that for me his book is for the encyclopediast, not for the emerging eye.  
 I like to to believe that I understand real estate because that is my profession. But my passion is the markets. I have my CMT certification. I know that I can make the transition from real estate to trading and be successful. Some say that I cocky and obnoxious but I know that I am good. I contribute to many chatrooms and many fellow participants respect what I have to write because I am truly the best. For example my contributions to the Bollinger site is arguably the most profound and meaningful. Other subscribers await my reviews of well know and highly respected experts because I am not afraid to identify their weak spots. So too with this author. He couldn't make it with money management and went bust and his books are a bust as well. He uses his supposed educational pedigree to impress propsective readers with his illogical conclusions. I once saw and tried to listen to a presentation he gave in Florida before the release of his book. His phony and empty-headed accomplice, wife? was there as well and someone accompanied him with a piano. Thank gosh the piano was sufficiently loud to drown his pompous, worthless gibberish. It would have been better had this inane book been accompanied by a loud CD that drowned out his drone. I would NOT read this book even if he paid me. It is truly an expression of this pompous egotisitcal loser and his empty excuses for failing with others' money. I have no respect for poeple who are cocky and don't have the performance and experience to back up their pomposity. I should know what to look for as I am just like Niederhoofer--we're both too cocky but at least my attitude is justified. This guy is truly someone that people kicked sand on when he was in high school--a nerd par excellence with no substance to back up his claims. He should be a philiosophy professor but he could never pass the muster to get certified 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Denise Austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults. This video isn't kid friendly, and doesn't have a good feel for kids. To be honest, it is very close to most of Denise's exercise videos for adults. What Denise has forgotten, or may have never known, is kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly, and that means with exercise videos to. A good choice for kids is - Kick to Get Fit Jr. -For Kids, this video is done by a qualified kid's fitness professional, not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids, and just hoping they can do them. My kids are NOT at all happy with this program.  There are 6 & 10 years old, and they were bored & turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes, mostly because they didn't understand the movements, and then found most of the other movements very hard to do. Once again, the forgotten point - Kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly. One last point, in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children's exercise & fitness. This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,-  You MUST be able to teach & instruct children at a level they understand. Just because you know something about exercise, it doesn't mean you are able to teach it to children. Knowledge is one thing - Teaching & Instructing is another, and the fact is, some people are just not very good at instructing children. A point that is very clearly displayed within this program. 
 Anyone who buys this CD thinking it has something to do with harp music is going to be very disappointed. There's nothing of the tranquility and serenity of the harmonious harp here. What you get is rather percussive and at times repetitive pianoplaying, seemingly based on random chords. The sort of stuff you don't want to play for more than ten minutes. Buyer Beware 
 A catalyst for the civil war, Uncle Tom's Cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves. The book's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out, and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the African American's pain, despite being redundant, rube and rife with tautology. The story is about Tom, a slave who saves his master's daughter and is promised his freedom. But his master dies before Tom is actually freed. The family falls upon hard times and Tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named Simon Legree. Legree tried everything to degrade Tom, but Tom holds firmly to his religious convictions. 
 This dictionary is just another long-winded, pretentious, unreadable, high-brow attempt to legitimize anthropology. The authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology. If you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class, and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions, forget this book 
 While few can sincerely argue against the assertion that in many ways the American educational system is in crisis and that serious scholarship must be devoted to righting the wrongs in this system, the 2004 Brookings Papers do very little in the way of concrete and viable options to fix these wrongs in the system and instead offer much in the way of obvious conclusions, such as that good teachers help students to learn more (I'm not kidding, folks). Serious discussion of options like charter schools, reform of the way teachers are certified, and voucher programs is bypassed in favor of rhetoric about improving the system without any concrete ideas of how to go about it. Another thing that I found disconcerting about the work is the way in which much focus is placed on improving the education of socioeconomically disadvantaged students, while ignoring the needs of any other type of student. On the whole, this collection was uninformative and painful to read and I would advise anyone with a choice in the matter to avoid it at all costs.  
 Ask yourself before you buy this book: would you want your daughter, sister, or mother selling her body to tourists and contracting deadly STDs while doing so? Probably not. 
 I think there is probably a chance that this is the most poorly written textbook I've ever encountered.  I was going to hold off giving it a bad review until I got through the class, but at this rate I'm not even totally sure I will. I've just re-read the difference between nominal and effective interest for (no hyperbole) the 10th time, and I'm no closer to understanding it. Bad examples, useless derivations, poor explaining. I only wish I could give it a zero 
 The errors, omissions and contradictions in this book confound its message.  Falk writes as if he is breaking new ground yet appears to be unaware of the large literature on long-age-evolution and the Bible over the last two centuries.  Had he read Henry Morris' 'The Genesis Record,' or Jonathan Sarfati's 'Refuting Compromise' he could never say, as he does, that Genesis creation constitutes only a `tiny section' of scripture.    Falk's world--where suffering and death are a natural and necessary part of life, and the penalty for man's sin was only spiritual death for mankind--leads to an absurd eschatology.  All of life, including humans, will go on doing what they do naturally (including suffering and dying) while humans will be resurrected in their spirits only.    Falk entirely undermines his agenda of championing science on the subject of origins with his claim that God creates by continually intervening in nature (p.131-132) in a `secret' and `hidden' way that is undetectable by man (p.15).  The scientific method is devoted to the search for proximate causes in observable (at least in principle) and repeatable natural phenomena.  If God continually intervenes, then science is no longer authoritative.   If Falk really believes that what he writes is true, then he should come to the conclusion that his position on a figurative view of Genesis creation is the correct one and that the literal view is therefore incorrect.  But he does not come to this conclusion.  He concludes that `There needs to be room for both views in evangelical Christianity' (p.227).  So all his protestations about `overwhelming evidence' and `the data of science demand it' do not lead him to any certainty for himself.  How then can he provide reliable guidance for his readers?  Obviously he can't 
 THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today. 
 I bought this product for my Tivo and it broke within a few weeks. As other reviewers have said, the RJ45 connector is incredibly fragile and it's really not a question of if it will break but when. I recommend the Netgear FA120 instead.  Instead of a flimsy flip-up, you plug the Cat-5 directly into a sturdy box, and it puts less pressure on the Tivo's USB port.  How a big company like Linksys, with all it's money and brainpower, delivers such an obviously inferior product is beyond me 
 Santa gave this to our daughter this year.  I am thoroughly disappointed with it.  We put the batteries in and started it up.  After reading the how to part, the graphics are terrible.  I had to prompt her to which flower to step on, not that that was necessary.  The princesses started dancing without stepping on the flower, it just made a funny sound.  The dancers go fast and fuzzy.  You can't tell for sure what the foot work is doing for the ballroom steps.  I even went on the mat and "tried."  My daughter lasted all of about five minutes and was done.  I hope Santa will take this back 
 When will MGA get it?? School is for LEARNING, not FASHION!!! And why are'nt the bratz seen in any classes? Hmm.. 
 I don't think this product works - I installed 2 of them and my rooms are not that big. I saw a mouse even after that. I think I will have to engage professional pest control. If you are buying to control rodents don't bother to waste yr money 
 This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read "Desperation" and "Insomnia" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.  I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of "The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.  I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery 
 I bought Zig Ziglar's book Raising Positive Kids in a Negative World, and had many problems with it. I am an Northeaster Illinois University student majoring in early childhood education, and I know a LOT about children. I thought this book would give me more insight on how I could help other parents raise positive children. Throughout his book Zig Ziglar constantly pats his self on the back/toots his own horn for all his accomplishments and "parents he has reached". He might know a thing or two about writing books on how to sell things, but he should leave raising positive children to the professionals. Yes, at the beginning of the book I was hooked and thought this man knew it all. I only got half way through the book when I realized that he knows nothing. I did not enjoy some of his ideas, for example if you and your children are not religious then they will be terrible people. I know plenty of wonderful children who do not believe in god. It made me sick to hear how he feels about working mothers, and women in general. Zig(what kind of name is that) is extremely sexist! Don't waste your time on this book. YUCK! If anyone wants this book(as a coaster of course) I will very happily send it to you 
 When the character who is narrating a lengthy novel is as unbelievable and artificial as Hannah Musgrave is in "The Darling", the book is not worthy of completing.    
 While comedian Al Franken is normally quite humorous, this novel was a bit dull. There's very little plot and after awhile every page seems like the one before it. Sure, there's the occasional funny part, but overall this book is not worth reading. Quite frankly, it's just stupid. If it didn't have Al's name on the cover it is very doubtful anyone would pick this up. If you're looking for something humorous read The Idiot Girl's Guide to Action and Adventure or The Bear Went Over the Mountain 
 THis book is so wack.  I should use it for toilet paper.  What a moron.  Survival of the fittest my a$$!  What an ignorant fool for writing such garbage.  Do not buy it 
 This book would do well to advertise itself as a series of articles about topics and people related to chocolate and chocolate production, but marketed as the story of chocolate it's needlessly boring. The chapters are about the length of an article and don't seem to be interconnected except in subject matter. The first few chapters were very interesting, but around the chapter "The Chocolate Coast" I realized that these were the longest 140-some pages of my life. I would be more interested in the history and lore of chocolate, rather than chapter after chapter of how he followed someone around, was almost denied access to their secrets/factory, and then talking about the different fermentation processes and what the machines look like. He may fare better to talk about wines, because that's how the subject is treated and somehow it just doesn't fit. He becomes haughty about the inferiority of american chocolate, treating his audience as a oenophile would speak to someone who drinks wine coolers. As for the writing, it seems to steer wrecklessly between very dry and excessively nostalgic.   This book would be a winner with people interested chocolate economics, how different people use difference processes, and how chocolate is used in foods around the world. Unfortunately I wasn't looking for any of these things 
 where are all the rock songs? i need to know sum from sum 41 and mest, and any others thanks if someone could or would respond 
 "contains 50 percent more caffeine than other gourmet coffees "  This is because it is not arabica beans, which are the beans of quality coffee brewing.  It is Rubusta, the cheap mostly vietnamese "filler" coffee mostly found ihn supermarket blends such as Folgers, Maxwell House, etc.    The flavor of burnt twigs but you get more caffeine.  That's pretty much Robusta.  I guess it's ok since most people who go into starbucks ask for vanilla caramel almond suger drinks rather than caring about the coffee... or is it because they've never been told that there is big flavor a difference between arabica and robusta and they incorrectly believe that if they order without all of the suger flavoring they'd taste Folgers (Or Shock)?    If you like coffee - good coffee - stick to arabicas.  If you like good coffee flavor and also lke more caffeine then just find a lighter roast of arabicas.  If all you want is caffeine you'll look smarter if you avoid the markeing silliness of Shock and buy NoDoze.  
 It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original.  My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered.  Don't order this product 
 It's not surprising that Brad Gooch, a professional homosexual, writes a book that makes Frank O'Hara appear to be nothing more than another professional homosexual. Actually, Gooch may be right. O'Hara is an incredibly minor figure in American poetry, and this books devotes too much print to a third-rate writer who would probably best be forgotten 
 This is exactly why i don't read fiction.  This book portrays itself as facts but the author spends way too much time on details.  i don't really need 3 paragraphs describing exatly what a particular gate looked like.  I'm not sure how this book got past an editor, but obviously it did.  Alot of this book is highly inacurate according to the Bible and the Satanic bible about The Fall.  It does have it good points and will draw you in, only to completely bore you minutes later 
 Seventeen tracks -- but maybe three decent jokes, tops. Eugene Mirman is in the comedy business the same way a barnacle is in the overseas shipping business 
 Okay, this book was so absolutely basic that I could have written it.  I was extremely disappointed with how much I didn't learn from this book.  It is 45 pages long, so if you're expecting a good, interesting weekend read--this is not it.  There weren't any detailed case studies.  There weren't any crime scene pictures.  Just basic info on fingerprinting and skull re-construction and a little bit of this-and-that.  Extremely basic.  Recommended for the interested 11 year old, but not for anyone who wants to really learn the nitty-gritty of Forensic Anthropology 
 I am not an advanced Excel user, but it is easy to find out that this book has many mistakes in coordinating the problem descriptions with the solutions, as well as typos in the book, when referring to certain cells. So, I do not know which of them should be corrected, but it is hard and time consuming, at least for a novice user, to understand what is going on. The solutions to advanced problems have no explanation, which on one hand is good because it makes you try to think...on the other hand though, it is such a disappointment to find out that the solutions you try to understand are wrong!! You can easily find it out by doublechecking with pen and paper.. 
 Well the title kind of says it all. Dull,ugly,boring men in a dull,ugly boring movie. Also the most unreallistic sexual pairing in the world. Stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Hurley with ugly, skinny, beaked nosed  Denis Leary.Steve Buscemi is comical as usual and adds the only bright spot to the film. 
 Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff 
 A quick glance through and I was very disappointed. There was no table of contents and virtually no intro/summarization/overview. It just plunged right into a particular encounter. This book has also been shredded a bit on various boards. I might buy it if an extensive errata came out soon.. 
 WHY MUST YOU ASK? WELL, AFTER SEEING THE LAST EPISODES, THIS SEEMED WIMPY. I MEAN, GOHAN BEAT THIS GUY WHEN HE WAS 5 YEARS OLD AND WAS STRONGER THAN GOKU, IN THE FIRST MOVIE. AND AFTER FACING FRIEZA THIS GUY SHOULD BE A ... ANT IN COMPARISON. IM SO SURE 3 OF THE WORLDS GREATEST FIGHTERS THAT  FOUGHT SO MANY BATTLES AN CAME OUT ALIVE AND STRONGER EACH TIME. GARLIC  OUGHT TO BE A BIG PUSH OVER TO THESE GUYS. BUT ITS AS IF THE Z FIGHTERS  HAVE WIMPED OUT. SORRY TO BE SAYING THIS TO ANY DBZ FAN BUT DONT BUY THIS  ONE. IM A BIG DBZ FAN MYSELF AND HAVE ALL EPISODES UP TO GARLIC. AND I  WOULD HAVE TO SAY ITS THE WORST IVE SEEN YET. JUST HARD TO COMPARE TO THE  FRIEZA SAGA WITCH TOTALLY ROCKS. GOOD TO WATCH ONE TIME MAYBE, BUT DONT  INVEST IN A COPY YOU WONT WATCH IT AGAIN BELEIVE ME. AT LEAST THE TRUCKS  SAGA HAS STARTED, NOW DO INVEST IN IT. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. THANK YOU! DBZ  FAN 
 The movie was well filmed.  The plot and dialogue while possibly accurate was dull and boring.  One of the worst war movies I have seen.  I own it but not for long 
 This pad is shown with the All Terrain Cargo Wagon as "Better Together" but it does not fit!  
 Haven't yet reviewed the DVD, but the book really wasn't very good. Oh well, here's hoping the DVD will be better 
 I'm always looking for a book that I can't book down, a who-dunnit that keeps me guessing to the end. This book was not it. Though Woods is great at fleshing out his main characters, he dragged out the mystery way to long to the point where I was disintrested. 
 within two weeks the hose connection was leaking.  the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the 
 This book is poorly written and not worth the money.  Too much time spent on vague ideals and notions of death and dying not enough substance.  Dr. Bolen spends very little time sharing the actual patient's stories and too much time on the New Age doctrine she so voraciously clings to.  A New Age sermon is what this book is, not a search for meaning during life-threatening illness 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 The subject of the Dead Sea Scrolls is a fascinating one.  But the book was very dry and tedious to read 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 This book contains an interesting, but never really captivating story. All concepts that make this book worth reading are already present in the first third of the book. Subsequent developments are in line with the story, but I felt little value was added for most of the middle part of the book. Only in the very end, the pace picks up again into a dramatic conclusion.  If the book had been one third the size, I would have enjoyed reading it to the end. Now it just felt like a burden to complete it 
 I would never have bought this movie for myself - I think the movie is lame.  I borrowed it from my nephew to see it and a friend "borrowed" and never returned it.  I just bought it because I owed my nephew the movie.  There were very few original funny moments in it 
 I felt sorry for my daughter this past Summer. She picked this book out of a list of 5 to read for school. The writing was all over the place, the plot went nowhere. Really boring. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...... 
 How could a great director like Tim Burton take a concept that is slam dunk good and change it so much as to kill it this bad. While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest. Talking humans did in the series and this movie as well. The apes come across as just cruel hunting and killing speaking animals and this sinks this turkey fast. A real let down and waste of tim 
   Hoff Summers had to withdraw one edition of this book from publication due to egregious errors in logic and fact.  The rest of the book is not much better. She cherrypicks her data,  uses outdated studies, jumps to stereotypical conclusions, and basically says all the stuff that feminist-bashing conservatives love. Basically, she blames feminists for everything, and she's got the conservative 'research' to prove it.    It would be amusing, it's so obvious, but at least liking this book serves to warn you about a person's intellect.  
 Where is the big storm?  Where is the story?  I'm still waiting.    I'm a 30 somthing married mom and I just did not get this book.    Not even a good summer read.  
 This book was relevant at the time it came out, if nothing for the fact it helped pump the patriotism and zeal to go to war.  However now, after we know the true facts, the lies, and the totally corrupt and inept administration running this country - this book serves no purpose.  I recommend Bob Woodwards new book, "Bush at War Part 2:  Denial", where he illustrates in detail how bad this administration has bungled up everything.  Skip this one, it is no longer relevant.  The only thing Bush is at war with anymore is his own conscience and moral fabric - which is woefully lacking 
 I was all geeked to watch this but was disapponted...I don't feel lke they picked the right person to direct this movie.  It seemed very empty to me! The fighting scenes were blah and that was what really blew it for me...maybe if it was longer it would have been better?  I don't know...and then there was a mini plot with a brother and sister that SEEMED OUT OF PLACE!!  sigh...Azumi was a much better martial arts sword movie 
 I was very disappointed in this book because I felt like the title itself is very misleading. The title of the book is called "FREE MONEY From the Federal Governement for SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS" By  Laurie Blum. The book description clearly states that there are hundreds of  millions of dollars available FREE!  to small business and entrepreneurs,  when in fact the only thing that I found in this book pertaining to small  businesses were LOANS and ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, and the last time I checked  LOANS are not free. This book description needs to be more clear as to what  kinds of grants are available and the title "FREE MONEY" should  not be used when this book is filled with mostly loan options. From reading  the book description I was under the impression that this was a book filled  with nothing but grant information!  I was very disappointed and  unsatisfied with this book. If I'm wrong or misunderstood this book please  fill free to correct me and direct me to the pages where the business  grants are supposed to be located 
 I'm a pretty diverse reader, so I decided to give this one a go.  It started out somewhat interesting, but then just sort of made me keep saying, "Okay...what's the point here?"  I really like Ninah, the main character, but I keep waiting for her to break free from the chains of this commune she lives in.  I guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this, but I closed the book wondering, "why did I read this?"  I grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the "punishments" just ridiculous.  I'm pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions, but this was just way out there for me.  Ninah's relationship with her Nanna was the neatest one in the book.  I'm glad I'm finished...now I can move on to something more fulfilling.  
 Seriously, I didn't even think that this was a comedy until I came here and saw people saying "it wasn't funny."  I got it as part of a boxed set of Cary Grant films (purchased here), and it's the only dud of the lot.  There was one scene that, I will grant you, was light and entertaining.  Not laugh out loud, but funny enough (I won't spoil it by saying which one).  Aside from that, the film struck me as a rather unbelievable farce about infidelity.    Most of all, you could almost feel the very talented cast trying to keep this elephant airborne.  Grant and Simmons, in particular, are strong - but their efforts are ultimately squandered.  Bob Mitchum is OK, but generally miscast, and Kerr's beauty and talent are basically wasted.  No amount of acting would allow you to believe that anyone could act as impetuously and stupidly as she does here.  She goes from happily married to tramp in about 5 minutes, for no discernible reason.    Overall acting: C (Grant/Simmons: B) Directing: F Writing: D-  I understand that this film caters more to English tastes, and that's fine, but I found it most un-satisfying 
 This book seemed to me to be written by an author, or authors, who were afraid to take it one or two steps further.  The storyline was weak, the action weak, the thugs and "bad guys" not believeable at all and the leading characters just shadows of what they could have been. I love the Stephanie Plum series and tried really, really hard not to make a comparison.  Unfortunately, the authors made it impossible to separate Plum from Hot Stuff.  There were Plumisms scattered throughout the book and the characters were recycled from the Plum books.  I wonder why Janet and LeAnn even bothered with the book.  There was nothing hot about Hot Stuff at all 
 Very disappointed with this Hamilton Beach "mixer".  It does not have the power or blade to mix ice cream shakes as advertised.  A spoon does a better job. 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 Boy is this band lame or what? The songs are slow, not catchy and she can't even sing. Jon, go back to Eve 6 and make some real quality music again!! EVE 6 ROCKS!

 My wife and I are just back from three weeks in Venice. We brought this book along, hoping that it would be as useful as Emily Wise Miller's wonderful "The Food Lover's Guide to Florence." It was not. We found the quality of the recommendations to be quite spotty: some excellent, some definitely not. We found the "variety" of cuisines recommended to be a little over the top (TexMex and margaritas in Venice?). Worst, by the end of our stay we found that only one of our half dozen or so favorite restaurants was in "Chow, Venice!": the selection here is not very reliable.  We had much more success with Michela Scibilia's "A Guide to the Eateries of Venice". Michela is that rarest of persons: a native Venetian between the ages of 25 and 60. She wrote the first edition of this book in 1992 (in Italian), as a way of guiding friends from elsewhere in Italy away from the tourist traps and towards her favorite places to eat. The book has been updated with a third edition and an English translation in the last few years. While it's not available through Amazon (fix that, you guys! ;) ), it's available in many bookstores in Venice, including those at the Doge's Palace and the Correr Museum in San Marco Square.  "Chow, Venice!" is not without merit as a secondary resource. We used its food glossary quite often. It recommends a few more "Inexpensive" restaurants than "The Eateries of Venice" (though we found buying a smaller meal at a more expensive place was a more interesting way of going "Inexpensive"). If you like great food, though, you'll definitely want to buy a copy of the Scibilia guide, even if you're only going to be in town a few days. 
 I bought this book because a few of the reviews said this was an extremely informative book on anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), well it's not.  The book mentioned a few of the more popular AAS on the market today and the "proper" dose, cycling, etc. none of which is even remotely accurate.  The author of the book has no medical background and apparently has no access to the internet to get the correct information on AAS.  I have studied AAS for years and have yet to read any peer reviewed paper that backs the ridiculous claims put forth in this book.  There are a ton of great books and articles out there for AAS and most are written by qualified individuals, this however is not one of them.  The author is a fool and it is a shame and scary that something like this can be published.  You must be a complete and total moron to think there is any truthful information in this book.  If you do buy this book or have bought this book, be sure to pick up a few more AAS books written by a qualified physician or research scientist. 
 Some children's shows age well and retain their charm ("Stingray" and "Thunderbirds" with their careful attention to detail, "Gumby" with its surrealism, "Davey and Goliath" with its classic moral lessons). I was looking forward to the Mickey Mouse Club on DVD as I had fond memories of watching it every afternoon after school. This has not aged well. "Spin and Marty" and "The Hardy Boys" serials are still enjoyable (they were both serialized on this program). The rest of this resembles an endless talent show put on at your local public school by some local kids. It isn't very entertaining. It gets tedious quickly. It moves very slowly.  The production numbers were expensive by children's show standards in the fifties but they look cheap and tacky by today's standards. Dull. I used my fast forward button a great deal on this one 
 The package the book came in was smashed. The book appeared as if it had been used. It took over 2 weeks for it to arrive. I wouldn't order any books from amazon agai 
 As John Waters wrote in his first book, "Shock Value," 'there's GOOD bad taste...and there's BAD bad taste.' Author Jimmy McDonough may have been wise to consider this before choosing to write an entire book about exploitation flick bottom-feeder Andy Milligan.   Not that a decent book can't be written about a bad filmmaker. Rudolph Grey's bio on Ed Wood is a pretty entertaining, informative read, after all. But, as presented by the author, Milligan's world of pervs, pederasts and theater rejects becomes more ho-hum than hair-raising. We're supposed to be shocked (I think) by the depravity of these people. Instead, just as in any Milligan film, the characters are too void of life to be very interesting.  Almost worse, as this book grinds on, it almost feels as if McDonough has lost sight of the fact that Andy Milligan made really, really, REALLY bad movies. Unlike the best films of, say, Herschell Gordon Lewis, there's no spark, no wit, no fun of any sort in a Milligan flick. Milligan's defenders will use words such as "gritty" and "merciless" to describe his work, thus placing it on a higher shelf than it deserves. Well, his films may indeed be gritty, but does that really excuse the fact that they're also unwatchable? And if they're so 'merciless,' does that make it okay that they're mercilessly boring too?  The long and short of it is that if Andy Milligan had any talent at all, he sure didn't show it in any of his movies. McDonough, in writing this book, seems to have gotten too close to his subject to see this. And in the author's hands, the story of Andy Milligan and his band of misfits just never catches fire. "The Ghastly One" might be a little better than an actual Milligan movie, but that's not exactly high praise. 
 This one is just plain awful!!   It's a bunch of Hollywood brats being histrionic.  
 This comeback was a big letdown.  I was really exited for Curt's return, and was hoping for some revolutionary music from T4F...Like "the Hurting" or "Songs from the Big Chair"...but instead i was really disappointed, as this disc of songs are quality songs... but they are so much like Beatles songs that I cannot tell if it is an homage/tribute, or just lack of original ideas (or fear of them).    This is a CD that does not compare with their early discs style and originality.  "Everybody Loves a Happy Ending" is like the song "Sowing the Seeds of Love", but more extreme in it's imitation of the Beatles style/sound.    It wasn't a happy ending 
 The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on 
 Saw the show in Washington and nearly fell asleep. Should never have been made. The score is dismall with a couple of all too brief moments of musicality, wisely given to Maureen McGovern. However, it's not enough to save this misguided mess. Skip the CD, pick up Jane Eyre, a musical version of a classic that works beautifully and deserved more success than it acheived 
 I randomly chose to buy and listen to this CD because they are playing at Coachella.  It isn't good.  It reminds me of StereoLab but without talent.  Each song is more insipid and boring than the last.  The music is an unfortunate combination of beats from a dated drum machine, irritating electonic blips, guitar for beginners and vocal stylings that are wimpy and heartless.  Needless to say...I don't get it 
 In theory, this is an excellent Cher compilation. The cover is lovely (and the first from Universal's 'Gold' series to deviate from their uniform aesthetic) and the tracklisting is a satisfactory overview of Cher's career. It certainly tops the domestic release of 'The Very Best of Cher' which was a skin-and-bones effort intended to offer the essential Cher songs and little else. Australia, Canada and parts of Europe, however, ended up with a far more interesting 2CD package. With a CD-busting length of 42 tracks, this deluxe release of 'The Very Best of Cher' leaves 'Gold' for dead. Although the two vary slightly on the earlier inclusions (you won't find Cher's brash reading of 'Alfie' on 'The Very Best of Cher', nor the iconic 'You Better Sit Down Kids' and 'Living In A House Divided) every song on 'Gold' appears on 'The Very Best of Cher' along with a healthy smattering of oft-forgotten cuts. Neither compilation addresses Cher's Warner albums from the mid-seventies, a shame considering 'Stars' and 'I'd Rather Believe In You' contain some of her best ever recordings, but at least 'The Very Best of Cher' makes more of an attempt to bridge the gap. 'Rudy' from 1982's 'I Paralyze' is a welcome inclusion, as is her otherwise unavailable on a Cher album disco cut 'Bad Love'. The Meat Loaf duet 'Dead Ringer For Love', a staple of Cher's hilarious/fabulous eighties schlock rock period, is also included, as is a cut from Cher's 1994 'not.com.mercial' CD which was sold exclusively through her website a few years back. There are also five songs from Cher's latest studio release 'Living Proof' which might seem slightly excessive, but the songs are frighteningly fun so the decision is justified.  Although the un-chronological sequencing on 'The Very Best of Cher' is rather frustrating - in that respect, 'Gold' is a more effective compilation - on content alone there is no contest. For the casual fan, the 2CD 'The Very Best of Cher' will be the only Cher album they ever need to own. For hardcores, it remains the most satisfying compilation and even offers a couple of rarities that make it a worthy purchase. Had Universal included a couple of unavailable tracks from Cher's mid-seventies period it would have scored extra brownie points, but as it stands 'Gold' is a fairly redundant release for the Cher connossieur and casual fans alike. The 2CD import version of 'The Very Best of Cher' is available here at Amazon. It may be twice the price but it is a far better investment 
 Elaine definitely cut the fat.  She also, however, cut the taste a huge way. There are definitely some books out there...especially a couple published in the last year or 2 that are great.  They really cut fat and keep flavor.  This one, unfortunately, is not one of them 
 When Mr. Burnside first got this book published back in 1999, it was probably the best book on the subject, and helpful to consumers. The truth is, though, it is embarrassing by almost any standard today. The editing is non-existent, and that just shows the lack of thought that went into this. It was thrown together, and omits more than it conveys. There are far better choices now; most notably Wes Johnson's "The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook" that just came out. The latter is an outstanding book, well-researched, far more thorough, and much easier to read. It will also save you more money than any other book on the subject that I've read. If you're thinking about buying a manufactured home, do yourself a favor and buy "The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook" instead. You'll be glad you did before the ink on the contract dries 
 The set up for this novel is interesting, if a bit easy to anticipate in the first half. The father: stoic and crushed by his love for a flighty, mentally ill woman. The mother: beautiful, ravaged by her own mental sickness, seemingly self-obsessed and consumed by superficial things. The brother: distant and angry. The daughter: spunky with a desire to rise above it all, hungry for the love of her brother and father. I was never--not once--surprised by any of these characters until the father found an interest in the occult in the middle of the book, and by then, I just didn't buy his his sudden turn. Lots of things happened, but by the middle of the book, I kept thinking, when is something going to happen that moves me?    Part of the reason that so many events with the potential to elicit great empathy from the reader fail to do so is that the book feels like so much backstory, so much summary. We rarely get to be fully present in the past moment with the characters, and because of this, the characters feel very distant and stiff.  But ultimately, this book frustrated me because of the awkward, contorted prose. Look--I'm fine with fragments and run on sentences, but when there is no rhyme or reason as to why so many are being used, they lose their impact and importance. The sentence structures in this book are beyond affected, and they really take away from what could have been an interesting story. I quit reading 2/3 of the way in, I will admit. However, if I feel nothing by then, there is a problem 
 I had never read anything by Terry Brooks, so I thought I would try listening to Armageddon's Children because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I guess the story is interesting, but I found it extremely slow and boring. The narrator has a dreary boring voice that drove me crazy. I couldn't even finish listening to the whole thing because it became torture 
 This game system is horrible. My son w anted it for Xmas and he played it once cause its so bad. The graphics are like PS1 at best and the load times are unbearable. Im' talking a good 5 minutes just to get started...stay away from this. 
 I couldn't wait to get this book, but what a disappointment.  Don't expect to get clear instructions because you won't!  The diagrams and instructions are extremely vague, and you will be left up in the air as to how to complete an item, you get one tiny bit of info and you're meant to just know how to finish the thing off.  Not worth the money and if I wasn't so far away I'd return it! 
 This is a case of the movie being a LOT better than the book.  The reason is that the tone and the conversational style of the book are so "cutsey," so patronizing, so ... tiresome; it reminds me of one of the Dummies books.  The writers ask so many questions:  "So what exactly are emotions?  Heard of endorphins? Sound familiar?  When was the last time you had an orgasm from a higher level?"  I'm really into the subject matter and I'm 3/4 of the way through the book, but I don't think I can finish it, just because the bad writing (not the quantum physics) makes it so hard to read.  I wish the authors had just said what they had to say without studying the Dummies format beforehand.  If someone picks up a book about the relationship between spirituality and quantum physics, they have to have had some intelligence and some prior reading in both subjects.  These authors don't recognize that.  Fritjof Capra it's not 
 the book is terrible because there are crappy examples and they go through all these proofs, but no one cares about that when you are assigned hw. but if your class is using this book, theres not much you can do about that. anways, i have the solutions manual for the even #'s. email me at briansuite@yahoo.com if you are interested 
 Simultaneously examining the first, second, and third waves of American feminism in her unprecedented volume, Sara M. Evans unwittingly squanders the tremendous potential from her initially good intentions.   Falling into the same 'post-feminist' trap readers are ironically warned against throughout the text, this book cannot unify second and third wavers. I certainly appreciate and have benefited from the work accomplished during this time period and am personally/professionally friends with individuals, but cannot see how a book ignoring my own generation's political activism is supposed to unify the two generations at large  Sharply contrasting with the glowing treatment given to herself and other second wavers, Evans only introduces the third wave as "recent participants in a world transformed by their mother's generation" (p. 213). In addition to implying that myself and others are really only interloping guests at 'somebody' else's social justice movement, this remark overlooks the critical perspectives we bring precisely as a consequence of growing up without legal segregation, with Title IX, Special Education, and many other programs which were only a dream for her generation.   While giving the 'riot grrrl' movement only one paragraph, she is oddly eager to devote much more book space to the faux feminists who made their public names attacking previous feminist theory (p. 221). Agreeing that it made for great mass media sensationalism, I do not accept this latter category as representative of my generation of feminist theorists, and am disappointed by Evans's stereotypes.   After ironically establishing how bias keeps women from being aware of their past (p. 38) she then specifically minimizes a feminism (which unlike the drivel by Roiphe, Summers, and Hoff) represented a major public resurgence of progressive ideas. Riot Grrrl theory argued that all forms of oppression are connected although patriarchy under girds this society. Just because something is different from her own generation does not excuse Evans from taking it seriously during the research process.      Other truly intergenerational feminist authors previously have argued the movement needs to make genuine efforts either to fully become or remain multigenerational, but Evans is blissfully oblivious to this necessity. In it's current state the book has no academic or personal redeeming quality and substantial revisions are needed to accord equal respect to all feminist generations.     
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 Hang on a minute.  I don't understand what's going on here...The book is called 'Halliwell's Film, Video And Dvd Guide 2005 by John Walker' according to the front cover.  So who wrote it?  Leslie Halliwell or John Walker?  Leslie Halliwell was a superlative film critic/historian, but he died in 1989.  It shouldn't be allowed for a book to be called 'Halliwell's...' unless it's written by him alone. The fact is that Halliwell is NOT a brand name.  It's the name of an author who died in 1989.  He wrote the entire books himself - He wasn't just the curator of a collection - he was an author in his own right.  To start adding further reviews by John Walker means it is no longer Halliwell's guide. Simple as that...  Why isn't there a Walker's Film, Video And Dvd Guide 2005 by John Walker? Presumably because it wouldn't sell as many copies.  If you want the genuine Halliwell article then please search out ebay for copies from the 80s.    What next?  The complete Works of Shakespeare by John Walker? 
 had to send (2) smokers back due to damage during shipping. was not shippers fault. very bad packaging,would be suprized if anyone could get one in good shape 
 While I found the book to be J.M. Barrie's style, for the most part, I thought it lacked his spirit. The original Peter Pan was full of fun, adventure, laughter. It was uplifting and made me wish I was a child again so I could join Peter and the others. This story could have done so much more with the characters. I found the story somewhat depressing. There was no fun. I missed the characters of the first story. Where was Smee? How can there be a Peter Pan without Smee and the crocodile? This story was dark. Peter was angry, depressed, greedy and full of negativity. Why would I want my child to read this? He almost wasn't the main character. Ravello was. A sequel to a famous story such as Peter Pan should continue with the positivity and joy of the first and this book certainly didn't do that. 
 My husband and I did not bother finishing this book. We skipped around to different chapters, as the editors suggest, in hopes of finding something erotic. The editors clearly had lofty aspirations for this book, but their  intentions fell short of what they managed to achieve. Unfortunately, most  of the stories were poorly written and laughably ridiculous; a bad  combination. You can get mediocre erotica on the 'net for free. Don't waste  your money 
 I purchased these thinking that I was buying the AA Big Book; there are distinct similarities upon initial (online) inspection. However, this isn't the entire Big Book; certain passages that I've found to be most relevant are absent. What good is this, then? Most dismaying is that their purchase price is the same as the standard AA Big Book. I've returned this purchase; it's far more practical for me to return them  than it is to try to fit these 'round pegs' in the square holes that are best filled with a bona fide AA Big Book.  Better luck next time. :

 I read this book and several others on the subject to help myself recover from a painful life-long relationship with an untreated, undiagnosed ADDer. My goal was to understand, and have compassion for those with ADD.  This book seems to be aimed at making those who have to live with ADD or ADHD feel good. In an attempt to make the ADDer feel better, he takes the approach that ADD is an outdated human survival mechanism that causes problems in our more organized society, therefore, it is not a "defect" or something that needs to be treated with medication.   The tendency to pile on fat is also such a mechanism, but that is no reason to consider it a "gift" or not seek ways to overcome it. The reality is that such things can pose very real health risks and the danger is that such opinions can assist those in denial to ignore the consequences of ADD/ADHD behavior on the family's health, happiness, and survival.  He also blames a lot of the increase in ADD on a society that watches TV, and an education system that stifles creativity. Many people try to link ADD with creativity as though one relies on the other. However, there are a lot of us that have grown up in the same environment as those with ADHD, but we manage to remember to pay the bills, we can maintain a job, and we manage to maintain healthy human relationships. And there are many artists, musicians and creative individuals who do not have ADD, and are no less successful for it.  If you are the parent of an ADD/ADHD child, there are some good tips for parenting. But if you are a spouse or child recovering from a disastrous relationship with someone with undiagnosed or untreated ADD, or if you are currently in a relationship with an adult with untreated ADD this book won't help you a bit.  There is no doubt that our society has been bad at helping those with ADD and our attitudes toward the behavior of ADD have caused self-esteem problems. However, the same is true of the overweight issue.  The bottom line is that ADD and ADHD has caused an untold amount of unhappiness for the person with ADD and the family. The behaviors of risk taking, the communication problems that manifest in relationship problems, and the impulsiveness and lack of self control that can lead to emotional or physical abuse are far too serious to be ignored. The exercises in the book are fine, but for anyone facing serious issues because of ADD behavior, think about medication to get the worst of the behavior under control. If medication can help treat it, I say, go for it. Then we can all sit in a circle and sing Kumbayah and rejoice in our "differentness" 
 extremely poor quality tools. complete waste of money for this price. barely worth $10 
 Not as good as the Dummies series which has better written and illustrated books on this subject 
 This book contains the usual worn out far left liberal drivel that college profesors have been trying to shove down the throats of uninformed students since the 60's.  In particular, the author's attempt to blame crime on poverty, etc. etc. leaves me nauseous.  Has he ever considered that our culture's failure to teach its young about moral absolutes might be a contributing factor?  He is entitled to his opinions, however misinformed they may be, but the book should come jacketed with a warning label 
 Woods has produced a silly anti-history of the U.S. in the hopes of generating a little revenue by finding a spot on the lunatic right-wing fringe bookshelf. Among things you will learn: The Whites treated Indians just fine and talks of exploitation are overblown. Blacks in the South were a contented lot, and the whole system was ruined by racists like Abraham Lincoln and the later Radical Republicans. Woodrow Wilson led the U.S. into World War One despite America's resistance to doing so. No mention of Teddy Roosevelt and the " Preparedness " movement. Also no mention that it was Congress that overwhelmingly approved the war declaration. And wouldn't you know it? In post World War II, blacks were knocking down the walls of segregation in an avalanche, and there was no need for federal intrusion, M.L. King, or even a Civil Rights or Voting act.  Woods even briefly makes a foray into sports to show how segregation was crumbling, since Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color barrier in 1947. He neglects to include that it took more than 10 more years to have all the rest of the teams come aboard; and furthermore, neglects discussion of persistent racism in other sports. Amazingly, the author has a Ph.D. in History from Columbia! How? It had to be on some government sponsored program that he detests. This is straight out of the Anne Coulter/Michelle Malkin school of history: heavy on mudslinging; infantile with the wrting and history. 
 First of all, pot doesn't make you aggressive. It's absurd to think that a person would spill the beans about their sexual fantasy in such a mean way after taking a few puffs from a joint. The argument after the pot smoking seemed too contrived, just like all of the dialog and action in the movie. Things only seem to happen to lead you into the next scene. It's ludicrous to think that a man is going to go off in search of a prostitute because his wife THOUGHT about having an affair.   Certain things seemed to be thrown in for shock value--Nicole Kidman on the toilet wiping herself, the nude, large-breasted patient that Tom Cruise was examining (what exactly was his specialty anyway?), and the father pimping his young daughter. Other things were thrown in for no reason at all: The patient whose father died and pathetically professed her love for the doctor. The prostitute, Domino, being diagnosed as HIV positive.  Another annoyance: Cruise's character always walked around saying "I'm a doctor", like that means something in NYC in the 21st century. (Sure, I'll let you into my store after midnight!)  The movie took us on a journey and then left us hanging. Too many questions were left unanswered: How did they know the doctor didn't belong at the party if everyone was wearing a mask and why was he such a threat since no one at the party could be identified? How did Nicole Kidman have a dream about an orgy the same night as the real one? How did the mask end up in the bed? Was there really foul play involved in death of the junkie prostitute and the quick exit of the piano player? What the hell was the point of this movie?   P.S. London only looks like New York City if you don't live in New York City 
 Vulgar, sloppy Donal Loge (last seen as complainer in Mel Gibson's film 'The Pa- triot', plays stoner and womanizing slouch,  who happens to be kindergarten teacher (!!),  who gets wake up call while trying to charm  the pants (literally) off John Goodman's real  life wife! He meets his match and learns a few  things along the way. All-American Steve's get looked up to in here; especially Steve McGar- rett! Horay for that, otherwise this sort of dull film would get two star rating from moi 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 I wish I had known this pamphlet (definitely not a book) was only 15 very sparse pages long because I would not have ordered it.  The word descriptions of actions to be taken are very hard to understand with no sketches or photos.  It seems more like  a book review or outline of a book that is yet to be written 
 I am like the last reviewer -  I wanted easy, chop it/dump it in and forget about it type of recipes.  At first glance in the bookstore it looked good and bought it.  I have been disappointed by this one - a lot of recipes have "weird" ingredients that a family with small kids just wouldn't eat or that I wouldn't have in my cupboards.  I keep looking for a "keeper" recipe and just can't find it.  Look at other slow cooker cookbooks - pass on this one 
 Having loved both the Arthur Waley and Edward Seidensticker versions of The Tale of Genji as well as the bits and pieces of Murasaki Shikibu's classical Japanese I had hammered through as a graduate student in East Asian studies, I was thrilled to hear that someone had done a "stunning" new translation of this work I and so many other Genji fans regard as one of the greatest "novels" ever written. Fortunately, a friend of mine, who is also a Genji fan, had the foresight to forward me some random passages of the Tyler version before I actually shelled out any money. In comparing these quotes to the Waley and Seidensticker versions I was much surprised to find that the Tyler translation comes up short in almost every regard, and that even Seidensticker's version, engaging as it is, is somewhat disappointing. Compare their respective translations of this short passage from a scene in Chapter Five ("Murasaki"), where Genji is visiting a Buddhist monastery in the mountains:  Waley's version:  Genji felt very disconsolate. It had begun to rain; a cold wind blew across the hill, carrying with it the sound of a waterfall--audible till then as a gentle intermittent plashing, but now a mighty roar; and with it, somnolently rising and falling, mingled the monotonous chanting of the scriptures. Even the most unimpressionable nature would have been plunged into melancholy by such surroundings. How much the more so Prince Genji, as he lay sleepless on his bed, continually planning and counter-planning.   Seidensticker's version: Genji was not feeling well. A shower passed on a chilly mountain wind, and the sound of the waterfall was higher. Intermittently came a rather sleepy voice, solemn and somehow ominous, reading a sacred text. The most insensitive of men would have been aroused by the scene. Genji was unable to sleep.  Tyler's version:  Genji felt quite unwell, and besides, it was now raining a little, a cold mountain wind had set in to blow, and the pool beneath the waterfall had risen until the roar was louder than before. The eerie swelling and dying of somnolent voices chanting the scriptures could hardly fail in such a setting to move the most casual visitor. No wonder Genji, who had so much to ponder, could not sleep.  There is no doubt Waley embellished the text, but it was clearly in the interest of conveying a sense of the exquisite poetry of Murasaki's prose. His elevated diction lends just that touch of "class" we would expect to find in an author writing for an aristocratic audience for whom style was everything. Moreover, the sumptuous musicality of his phrasing continually underscores the melancholy atmosphere even as it seems to echo the sound of the waterfall and the chanting. Seidensticker's version has the virtue of concision, but his choice of words is often questionable: "reading," for example, suggests that Buddhist monks read the sutras in private meditation rather than chanted them as a group prayer. His "sacred texts," on the other hand, implies that Genji wasn't very familiar with Buddhism, which could hardly be further from the truth. It was as central to his life and worldview as Catholicism was to the Italian princes of the Middle Ages, as Waley's "scriptures" implies. The phrase "aroused by the scene" is even more ill-chosen, for it suggests that Genji found visits to mountain temples erotically stimulating, when in fact they tended to have the opposite effect, for they reminded him of the vanity of his secular pursuits, which were, by and large, erotic.   Tyler's version follows Waley's interpretation at this point and thus avoids these particular problems, but he has others that are even worse. His "a cold mountain wind had set in to blow," for example, is dreadfully clumsy and somewhat confusing, as is his "the pool beneath the waterfall had risen until the roar was louder than before". The latter illogically suggests that it was the increased height of the pool below the waterfall that made the roar louder rather than the increase in the volume of water flowing over the falls due to the rain that had passed. A good many phrases in the other passages I sampled from the Tyler volume had similar kinds of problems, which makes me wonder if Tyler's editors ever bothered to read the work they insist is so "stunning."  If any version deserves that praise it is Waley's, which may be difficult to find, but it is well worth the effort 
 The information provided was general, however the samples will provide a first time resume writer with the basic outline to follow.  The information in some samples, such as a housewife entering back into the work force, were a bit too hyped up to take seriously.  
 I used this text for pre-med biology course-- I was simulataneously taking Biochemistry as well, but more on that later.  The text, while not overwhemingly as detailed as other reviewers write, was all in all okay, but fell short in many areas.  One of them is the distinct typographical and grammatical errors that riddled, what seemed, to be the only chapters we covered.  There were many sentences that were run-ons, which disrupted the learning and flow of the text (and, in my opinion, a textbook backed by such a major publisher as this, errors like that are out of the question).  Sometimes, for instance in the TCA chapter, I felt that the material presented on Oxidative Phosphorylation seemed out of order, and just a bit too condensed.  The photosynthesis chapter was utterly horrible.  The exercises at the end were poorly written, and seemed to ask esoteric questions about common topics.  The answers to these questions were esoteric still.  I felt that the only saving grace about this were the wonderful pictures: I liked how each chapter opened up an exhaustive diagram.  Other than that, this is book pretty much only a decent cell bio book, but no biochemistry one 
 AS I FIRST BEGAN READING THIS BOOK I WAS GREATLY IMPRESSED BY THE AUTHORS PASSION, CLARITY, AND HIS THOROUGH AND ENLIGHTENING APPROACH. THEN ALL OF SUDDEN HE BEGAN PRAISING VATICAN 2 AND "HOW BRILLIANT IT WAS". WHERE EVERY OTHER PARAGRAPH REVERTED TO VATICAN 2 DOCUMENTS. I TOTALLY LOST INTEREST, I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER FINISH IT... PERHAPS BECAUSE VATICAN 2 DISGUSTS ME, I DON'T KNOW.. 
 This is said to be one of Nadine Gordimer's finest works, and she is a Nobel prize winner, so I hoped for great things when I picked this one out at the bookstore, unfortunately assuming that the Nobel prize would be a guarantee that I would love it.  Well, I didn't love it.  While indeed a competent storytelling, I don't really regard this as literature.  There is not the fire, imagination or creativity one expects, nor the sophistication that should elevate such a work above its peers.  I managed to get to the end, but I can't say that I felt or learned anything at all.  It makes me wonder if there were political, rather than literary reasons that caused the Nobel comittee to honor this author. 
 After many years, I decided to finally give Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series a go.  So, where better to start than her debut novel 'Deja Dead' which introduces Reichs' heroine.  Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist working in Montreal for what I'm guessing is the French-Canadian equivalent of a Medical Examiner's office.  Of course our heroine is head strong, independent, and unlucky in love (aren't they all?).  Well, some murders start turning up and, amazingly enough, our intrepid anthropologist is the only person that links the crimes together.  Do the police believe her?  No, so she must investigate the crimes on her own.  And by doing so, the murderer then turns his attention to Brennan and her family and friends (don't all killers eventually do that?).  First off, the book is bloated.  The book (at least the paperback version) clocks in at about 530 pages.  Reichs' writes too much about menial tasks that her character, Brennan, does during her usual day.  Does anyone really want to hear repeatedly about what a character had for dinner or what paperwork she does at work?  I know I don't want to read it.  Now I'm a person who enjoys a nice, long book but 'Deja Dead' (where did she get that title anyway?) is about two hundred pages too long.  And it is a very slow read.    Secondly, her main character, Brennan, just isn't likeable.  In fact, I found her quite annoying.  The policemen in the novel are portrayed as incompetent, arrogant jerks who are too worried about being right than they are about doing the right thing.  When in fact I think that they just didn't want to deal with this overly nosy anthropologist who is obviously stepping on toes and irritating people who are just trying to do their jobs.  Reichs' tries to portray Brennan as a lone crusader fighting against all these odds to get to the criminal.  When in fact she is an irritating anthropologist who has no business investigating a murder.  She is, basically, a laboratory-based employee who should not be in the field.  So I don't blame the cops in the book that don't like her.  She's butting her nose in where it doesn't belong and, in a part I actually liked, she ends up bringing irreparable damage to her family and friends.  I thought it a just outcome.  Also, after about the twentieth time of Brennan looking at some cop's rear end and saying "I like the way his butt looks...Oh, stop!  You need to get laid." I wanted to scream.  Dr. Brennan, at least in this debut novel, is extremely irritating.  Thirdly, I have read the basic plot of this book in a hundred other novels.  The suprise "switcheroo" ending is not suprising but more annoying...  It is just a cheap way to trick the reader.  And if I have to read about one more main character who ends up becoming the target of the "killer", I will scream.  Its pathetic.  How many times does it need to be written?  Its ridiculous.  Now, 'Deja Dead' is the first of Reichs' books that I've read.  I've heard that the following books in the Brennan series are better and I certainly hope this is the case.  I really didn't like the book:  not the characters, the plot, the writing...  But I will give Reichs another try and read the next book in the series.  If its as bad as 'Deja Dead', I don't think I ever read another one her books 
 Nickel and Dimed is about the author's experience of being a poor white women trying to pass off as a part of the working class. The book hits on several good points but she could have gotten the same information in an interview. A better book on the poor and not getting by is The Working Poor: Invisible in America 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This is a good example that some DvD's should have parental warning labels.  This one should read: WARNING!  THIS DVD IS NOT FUNNY  Someone got this for me as a present because I like Lewis Black.  He's funny, but this is nothing like his stand up routine or any of his recent work.  All the jokes [sic] are sexual.  It's a couple of sketches filled with recycled offensive sexual humor.  Usually when one uses an old joke, one endeavors to tell it in a funnier manner than it was previously used.  Not so in this DvD.  A three year old says, "poo poo," and laughs and laughs as if it's the funniest thing in the world.  The humor in this DvD is little different 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 despite early promise, marked by intriguing personal observations and evident self-reflection, this effort fails to deliver on the author's experience and acumen.  the book is a disparate set of chapters and lacks a unitary thread, apart from a bitter leavening of asides on the shortcomings of United States rhetoric and policies on Africa.  i had hoped for more, given the fine record in newsprint of this well-traveled journalist.  
 Don't know why my first note hasn't appeared, so I'll briefly restate. the claim-to-fame of this film is it's avant-garde, push-the-envelope sexuality. Amazon describes this film as "Unrated", but that's not what nearly all of these listings are selling. These are the new "R" Rated version that is MASSIVELY redacted. In fact, all of what makes this film famous has been reduced to some brief nudity. Even though the box continues to bill it as "The sexiest movie ever made." On top of that, despite an English only cover, my VHS purchase was subtitled in SPANISH. The seller has offered an adjustment. He didn't know. But Amazon needs to drop the 'Unrated' description, as that implies the original. Those still interested might look for something like a 'director's cut'. I still haven't found one. Sorry if this is a duplicate of previous post 
 I only jumped in to look at what was written about Hemingway and Col. Buck Lanham and it didn't take long to realize how off this author is. The story he writes took place at "Schloss Hemingstein" in the Schnee Eifel region of Germany in September 1944, not in the Huertgen Forest as claimed, which didn't occur until November. Moreover, Hemingway met Col. Lanham back in Normandy in July. Ouch! And to think this made past Wiley editors. Oh for shame. 
 I'm not sure, maybe I just got ripped off, but is there supposed to be only 1 song that is 9 minutes long on the cd?  
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 Francis Bacon said that some books are meant to be chewed, some swallowed, and some digested.  This book is meant to be spit out.    I recently returned to the college classroom as a student of Human Anatomy and of Nutrition (preparing for entrance into a nursing program).  For those classes I read, respectively, Marieb's "Human Anatomy and Physiology" and Whitney's "Understanding Nutrition."  The contrast between these two widely-used textbooks could not be greater.  The one is clearly written, lucidly organized, and filled with revealing graphics; the other is horribly opaque, repetitive and senseless in organization, and replete with distracting charts and photos.  Comparisons are odious, so I will just amplify my main points and have done.  This book reads as though written by someone who is more anxious to prove the scientific merit of her field or her own expertise in the latest research than by someone interested in helping the reader understand major concepts for further study.  Virtually every paragraph has the main point--if there is one--obscured somewhere in the fourth sentence, with irrelevant detail draped around it, so that the reader is forced to do the work the writer should have done.  You can learn about nutrition by reading this book in spite of the style, not because of it.  The last three or four chapters on nutrition in the life cycle and diet and health repeat what was presented in various places in earlier chapters on digestion and on nutrients.  After reading a popular book on nutrition by a professor at Cambridge(Brown's "Energy of Life") that was clear, concise, and not condescending, I inferred that Whitney has succumbed to the disease afflicting many textbook writers:  the structure and content are dictated by the editors' anxiety to keep up with the competition rather than by the author's own insight.  On virtually every page, there is a photo, chart, or graphic that distracts or insults the reader's efforts to learn about nutrition.  A stray "factoid" about calories crams the margin or a photo of a vegetable pulls the eye away from the discussion.  Evidently the editors feel the subject itself is not interesting enough to keep my attention.  They're right, when it's presented in such a haphazard and condescending way.  If this book were not used regularly around the nation as a textbook in many courses, it would long ago have disappeared from the market, since no ordinary intelligent person would voluntarily wade through its turgid, repetitive, and insulting bulk.  I'm outraged that this book is so expensive and so lousy.  I sold my copy on Amazon the instant the course was over (whereas I cherish my copy of Marieb's book and can't wait to read it again).  It's a shame, because now I must look for another book on nutrition, one that I can read and gain insight from with pleasure on an important subject 
 I've read easily a dozen poker books - normal stuff like, Jones, Sklansky, Harrington, Gordon, and I thought this book would talk about Matt'a learning experience, what levels he started at and where and what he learned.  This book started out like a read for a complete beginner with talk of how to play Hold 'Em.  It continued with a self-inflated view of his trournament history - include hand by hand in certain tournaments.  It includes stuff like "then with the blinds at 500-1000, I picked up ATo and raised on the button to take the blinds."  Jesus - who cares?  The amazing part is that this book was written BEFORE he won playing in the 2004 WPT Championship.  He was nothing but an amateur with a couple cashes.  He had no business writing a book.  And sinec this book was written in 2003, some stuff has a bit out of date.  I wish I had not bought the book at all 
 But still an OK good all round resource, albeit woefully short on design ideas.  My first reaction was that it's not the book the other reviewers read, but maybe I was too hard on it.  This is an edited review, and if I could change the number of stars, I'd give it three, anyway, having set it aside and picked it up again.  I have several other books that cover the subject very well--especially when it comes to function and design--and I've been through a remodeling, so a lot of what's in this one didn't seem new, thorough or insightful the first time I sat down with.  Probably the rave reviews by other readers created unreasonable expectations that this would have some fabulous unique insights about designing kitchens that work AS KITCHENS.  It doesn't, but it is very comprehensive when it comes to construction, working w/a contractor, avoiding on-site screw-ups, adapting kitchen layout to the spaces that surround it, etc., none of which should be given short shrift.  Maybe that's what excited the other reviewers; guess that's the main perspective and expertise of the authors.  It would be quite useful for someone who has not spent as many months [years, maybe] studying the subject and been through multiple additions and remodelings.  Don't buy this one for design ideas.  It tries, but it's not even the best when it comes to function, though you might have high expectations based on the title.  It's really pretty basic in that respect and focuses more on common mistakes that contractors find in designers' work, like 'that door is going to bump into that [wall/cabinet/doorway/etc.].  The most thorough book on my shelf when it comes to kitchen function [i.e., making using it efficient and comfortable] is good old (1980) Build Your Harvest Kitchen (Rodale Press).  For creative design ideas, try DK Home Design Workbooks: Kitchen.  For innovative, high style ideas, try Terence Conran Kitchens: The Hub of the Home.  Another good one is Kitchen Redos, Revamps, Remodels, and Replacements: Without Murder, Suicide, or Divorce; also the New Kitchen Idea Book.  I also have and like Joan Kohn's It's Your Kitchen.  My current kitchen is based on ideas pulled from everywhere, including pages ripped from obscure magazines and stuff I found on the web.  If you're not as inclined as I am to cast a wide net, maybe at least these brief comments will lead you to a book or two that will meet your needs.  This might be one of them--if you're handing the contruction details yourself 
 Jack London's efforts at social novels, such as "Iron Heel" and "Martin Eden" were failures, because they are very cardboard and unconvincing. Jack London, the master story teller of the juvenile boys adventure novels, had a social conscience, but was not very good with expressing the social issues of the day, issues which usually belong in manifestos, not in literature. Jack London was no Dostoievsky, a true literary giant 
 I read this book because I liked The Ice Storm. I read this book because of the descriptions of what the book was about and the 5 star remarks of various reviewers. I thought, wow... another "Rules of Attraction" something funny, cynical, and stories of passive, troubled youth growing up in the 80's. I thought it was going to be a good read. I was wrong. Wrong. I judged a book because of its descriptions but I should be weary next time. I've never read a book about slackers and 20 somethings so boring in my entire life. Drugs, sex, music, parties, psycho hospitals... those topics should be interesting, fun, sentimental, or whatever to read about. But Moody just bored me and in the end this book should be forgotten. It was highly disappointing and the characters are not worthy. Bret Easton Ellis can at least pull off dispicable and hateful characters that are fun to read about but the dispicable characters in this book I didn't even care for. I just wanted to finish it and get done with it. Just like the characters in this book too stupid to be named, this book is too stupid to be remembered.   
 I agree with many of the above reviewers.  While it is a fun, sort-of, peek into Arab/American culture, I do not find it to be all that realistic.  As a part of an Arab/American family, I was really surprised to find main characters who are supposed to be Arab Christian with names like Fatima, or Abdul so and so. This is not authentic--any Arab would recognize this as false, as well as the constant use of phrases referring to the Prophet, which would not, as another reviewer asserted, ever be used by Arab Christians.  Even the transliterated Arabic phrases and descriptions are incorrect and seem contrived or false somehow.  I also had a hard time even liking most of the characters, as they never really seemed to develop beyond the outward description of themselves.  I think that non-Arab readers will not see a picture of an Arab/American family; rather, they will only see a cartoonish parody of the "A-rab" culture they do not understand as it is.  However, for someone who knows/lives/understands the culture, it is somewhat entertaining, though slightly irritating.  For a more realistic view of Arab life, read books by Leila Ahmed, Hanan Al-Shaykh, Ahdaf Soueif, or Naguib Mahfouz 
 I expected this book to be fun take on the Hollywood nanny experience where the reader can peek at the "other side" and perhaps try to guess who might be the real people behind the pseudonyms.  Nope.  Susanne Hansen is a cad who betrays her former employers (and her nanny friends' employers) by exposing their private family dynamics for entertainment and ridicule.  It would have been much, MUCH better had she changed names and focused more on the celebrity lifestyle gossipy end of it than in her own boring self-examinations and snotty judgements.  In every page she obsesses over wealth and then condemns the very people whose assets she admires.  She seems to think that shallow and neglectful parenting is something only to be found in the nanny-hiring set.  There was no joy in reading this book once I realized that while she may have changed the children's names, the names of the parents were quite real.  It puts the lie to how much she felt for her charges that she would so humiliate their parents in pursuit of the almighty dollar 
 As a preschool teacher who tries to include all kinds of traditions in my classroom, I'm always on the lookout for a new fun book.  The kids do love I Know and Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly.  That book is so preposterous - who could REALLY swallow a horse?  However, this book takes the tradition of eating too much at Thanksgiving way overboard, with the woman who eats a family sized meal on her own, and ends up as a blimp sized balloon in the holiday parade.  The illustrations show her bumpy fat body getting bigger and bigger.  Children are already taught too young that they will get fat if they overeat.  Childhood eating disorders are on the rise. One study showed that 40% of 4th graders are on diets.  Children point out fat people to their parents in public, and parents never know what to say - it's hard to teach size-acceptance and tolerance in general to a child in the first place, but to add these pictures and negative stereotypes of fat people to a child's imaginative repertoire is not necessarily a good idea. 1 star for this book is 1 too many 
 All this talk of Islam suddenly being the anti-christ, final fight against evil, blah, blah blah.  Do you remember when American Christians were busy killing American Indians?  All along the way our preachers said the Indians were heathens and savages, when it was we who were the authors of slaughter.  By the end of the day the few surviving Indians were herded onto desolate desert reservations to slowly starve into oblivion.  (Oh, and we took their children away to "boarding schools" where they were forcibly converted to our "faith".)   Doesn't anyone get it?  Why do almost all the Latin American countries hate us?  We meddled in their countries for over a hundred years, supported evil dictators so our rapacious corporations could rape their land of resources.  The US even invaded some to topple democratically elected governments.  Fast forward: the US, goaded by the natural desire that every expansionist nation has to control more and more resources, has meddled in Muslim nations for over fifty years now, supporting evil dictators, now even invading them on lies to blatantly control their oil more directly.  In the same way that the establishment of Israel was an invasion by outsiders into Arab lands, (and resulted in Arabs fighting back), isn't the US being exposed to Arab vengeance over our disastrous policies over there.  It's like the high school bully punching a bunch of kids, and stealing their lunch money, and then when the oppressed kids start kicking him in the knees, he cries foul.   Really, Americans got to get it together and realize that if we minded our business and didn't try to dominate over everybody all the time, we wouldn't be in this mess.  Heck, Osama was created by our own CIA!  Our army is sitting in almost 150 nations around the world!  Won't Christians get some brains 
 For anyone looking to find a detailed resource on the care of betta splendens, this book is not for you. A great deal of space in this book is devoted to the history of the fish, how they fight with other males (there are even explicit pictures of this process, which I was certainly not interested in seeing), and how to breed them. The sections covering their care are woefully lacking - the page on diseases merely lists the ailments and then offers a recommendation for another book in which to find more information. The tone of this book also stunned me - it is apparent that the author thinks of these fish as a source of income rather than as pets. Mention is made of fish that are not "exciting or saleable," and how sub-standard hatchlings should be culled or disposed of. I was quite offended by this - even the most dully-colored betta could find a happy home somewhere! The only reason I'm giving this book one star at all is because there are a lot of beautiful photos inside. It looks more like a picture book than anything else, actually. Very disappointing 
 I never read the book, but I have been on e-harmony for 6 months. They were sending me matches the first 2 weeks, but most of "matches" were not responding at all or the people were totally the opposite of me. I manage to meet one single girl out of there in 6 months and as soon as we met we started to laugh because we were so different, that even a stranger could say we weren't a match. I called e-harmony several times to cancel my membership and have some refund, but they only agreed to prolong my membership without additional expenses. I didnt get ANY matches in the following 6 months, even though I WAS ACCEPTING MATCHES FROM THE ENTIRE USA!!! I calle dagain just to hear excuses. Now, every time I see the ad on the TV...I just laugh. dont subscribe to these people, its not worth of it. Oh and by the way, I sold the book on ebay for $11.50. Total loss, total waste of time and money 
 I found this book to be very short on any kind of meat or details. I'm very tempted to ask for my money back. There is no insight here - the book could have been compiled from a series of press releases. I think the standard of the book is typified by the 'bibliography' which seems to list every single article the author has ever written, including in magazines like Computer Shopper a  decade ago. How that is supposed to be any help to anybody I cannot see. Do yourself a favor and skip this one 
 As with any anthology, the appeal and the quality of the essays here varies, but what prompted me to write a review is the extraordinary tone of smug superiority that wafts off of all too many of those found here. The most egregious example of that smugness is to be found in a vicious little piece by Sally Bellerose in which she regales the reader with her saintly forebearance as she describes the horrors bestowed upon her delicate consciousness when she deigns to honor her reactionary parents with her presence at their dinner table. And could you have a book of this kind without including that Queen of Noble Suffering, Maya Angelou? She's represented here with a snippet from her often anthologized book "Wouldn't Take Nothin' For My Journey Now." There's also the pro forma male bashing in many of the essays ("Now I cook as a woman, free of that feeling of enslavement with which a male culture has imbued the process of preparing food.") There's also the stereotyping that often goes along with this kind of generic thinking; eg. "Everyone knows that TV dinners are mainly the province of heterosexual males and the career woman who lives alone. Gay men often enjoy cooking and are generally as good at it as the most creative woman." The editor is a professor in the women's studies program at U. Mass, Amherst. I doubt there's much room for discussion in her classes, unless that discussion serves her dogma. It's not the politics I disliked so much as it is the unquestioned assumptions and the tone of sanctimony that cling to these memory scraps.  If you're already in the choir, this book will be happy to preach at you, but if you have yet to sign off on every blessed stereotype of oppression, you may find it annoying in some places,offensive in others 
 The service was great I recieved my package within a week, but when i opened it i noticed that the book was damaged due to the poor handling. I guess if your looking to just have the guide for reference then you won't have a problem but if you want it for keeps then you might want to order it with some bigger stuff so it doesn't get damaged on the way 
 AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I bought this for a little over $15 at another store and returned it within a week...Horrible transfer (if it were ALPHA video i wouldn't care, but come on...this is a major DVD company we're talking about, SONY!!!!!). Aspect ratio isnt the theatrical format, but rather PAN AND SCAN cropped sides bulls#it. Plus its missing like 20 minutes! I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. Just the thought of this release makes me angry (to the point of inarticulate). AVOID AVOID AVOID! and write a letter to your congressman (ha!)...or perhaps SONY/MGM. This release is inexcusable 
 I find it interesting that such a supposedly important and relevant contemporary work has only been reviewed by 11 people at the time of this writing. That alone tells you all you need to know since this is a book that is classed under both Latino and Women's Studies, and is part of many university literary programs.   The book is pretentious claptrap of the worst kind. If this book were judged on its merits rather than by popular, politically correct notions, it wouldn't come close to making the cut.  Alas, academia has embraced the book as a great work, and so it is required reading for an English M.A. program at a major university that I was accepted into. An English M.A.! Once I saw that this book was part of the program, I didn't even bother registering.  I don't mind rants against social, cultural and economic injustices. I've read many. But Ms. Anzaldua is no James Baldwin, that's for sure.    
 Absolutely no power whatsoever. If you have true back or shoulder pain you are better off with a hand massage or standing under the shower. No power at all in this machine. 
 I had such high hopes for this book, based on its description.  And in spite of the author's sometimes hard-to-follow writing style - she does love to start in one place and wander quite far from the original subject before finally winding her way back - for the first few chapters I managed to hold on to those hopes.    But in the end, I would have to classify this book as 80 percent disappointment.  Charlotte is set up to be a very sympathetic character: Married to a man she loves, but trapped in the family home surrounded by a seemingly endless supply of in-laws (also all residents of the family home), none of whom have ever made much of an effort to make her feel a part of the family.  Charlotte has been unable to bear a child to term in all the years of the marriage, and her 10 months in a sickbed seem to have put the final distance between her and her husband, Hays.  Finally, after an inexplicable recovery (the author never bothers to give any hint of why Charlotte is suddenly well after all this time), Charlotte is off to surprise her husband at the wake for one of his recently deceased uncles.  But what she encounters is Hays and a mystery woman, just about to share a kiss.   Calling in a favor from the local baker and his wife, Charlotte finds herself at the hotel of the title, facing a chilly reception from Mrs. Petty - the former cook in Charlotte's in-law's house - who had been the one to first tell Charlotte about the hotel. (Though not about the details of what goes on there.)  To this point, the book was enjoyable.  But once Charlotte lands in the hotel, the book heads into a decline from which it never recovers.    The efforts of the hotel's owner, his staff and Charlotte's Aunt Lily - a surprise "regular" at the hotel - to get Charlotte out of the hotel were understandable, if a little tedious.  Arthur's attachment to Charlotte is pretty sudden, and regardless of how she feels about Hays' cheating on her, it seems a little odd that she would embark on an affair with Arthur quite so easily.  And unless the author is planning a sequel, there were things in this book that just didn't seem to have a reason for being.  Charlotte's introduction to the hotel owner's wife and her servant, for example.  An interesting enough scene, but to what purpose?    The artist who created all the paintings in the hotel - introduced, then killed off.   Mrs. Petty and her children - suddenly packed off to another situation, for the good of the children.  Sure, we learn who the father of one of the children is, but again - why?  Charlotte's parents, who have been conspicuously absent from Charlotte's thoughts for a good portion of the book - there's no purpose to their appearance at the end, nor really to Charlotte's search for them.  The ending, as mentioned by another reviewer, is the worst part of the book.  Why does Charlotte do what she does when she leaves the hotel?  Is it guilt, a desire for reconciliation?    Charlotte frustrates me...I don't know what she wants, and most of the time she doesn't seem to know, either.  In the end, I didn't care much about this book, except to wonder about the several chapters that seemed to have been lopped off the end.  Maybe they would have wrapped things up in a better fashion.  I won't read this book again, and I certainly can't recommend it to others.  
 For a political junkie, this one is a nice start, as it really does provide some of the 'behind the scenes' commentary and detail others lack.  However, having said that, I was really disappointed with how little detail the book did provide on the campaigns.  Yes, it's perfectly obvious the Newsweek staff got a lot closer to the Kerry campaign than they did to the Bush campaign.  And yes, that means they treat the Kerry side of the story with a lot more sympathy than they do the Bush side.  It surprised me how much of the inside Kerry story never got out during the campaign (I watched the election campaign obsessively, I admit it).  It also surprised me that one of the key Kerry gaffes (I would have authorized Bush to go to war even knowing about the lack of WMDs) nearly was killed by the press on the Kerry campaign and the book spends two pages on the discussion of whether or not to report it.  It would certainly seem to, at a bare minimum, indicate that the press was a lot more willing to give Kerry the benefit of the doubt than Bush, and subsequent revelations only reinforce that thought.   Having said that, I have to say that the Bush campaign may have did themselves more harm than good in keeping the press at arms length, as it may have led to less favorable coverage simply because they couldn't get access for an inside scoop.  The fear that that scoop would be invariably negative seems the reason for that decision, but it may not have been the best one, as there were Bush-favoring press and columnists out there, though few and far between.  What surprised me the most was not what was in the book, but what was left out of it.  Not a word on Republican reactions during the Democratic Convention.  Very little on the foreign policy disasters that Bush was having (Abu Gharib, the Spanish pulling out of Iraq after March 11th, etc).  Nothing on the Democratic 527s and if they coordinated their message with the Democrats, as it is implied quite strongly throughout the book.  Very little on the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, only covering them in August, when junkies like me were at least somewhat aware of them back in April.  No discussion of the book the SBVT wrote, or of any of their charges, just a quick dismissal of them as unfounded and baseless, which strikes me as very foolish, as I think they were one of the key elements in Kerry's loss.  Almost nothing on the Bush National Guard memos, I was very interested to know what both campaigns thought of them and they could hardly have been brought up and forgotten so quickly.  Very little analysis of the debates and on the mysterious thing under Bush's jacket in the first debate.  I think it was later found to be a bullet-proof vest.  Michael Moore and his watch for dirty tricks on election day movement, and movie, and support of the Democrats, similarly ignored.  The entire Bruce Springsteen campaign to bring out younger voters, never touched.  And aside from a very few brief mentions, nothing at all on the economy, and how that might have affected the campaigns.  In short, some nice behind-the-scenes tidbits, but sorely lacking in a lot of issues and failing utterly in terms of analysis 
      I agree with some of the less favorable reviews.  Many of the people in the book came from big named schools and were very well off financially before thinking about a life change.  Some of the stories left you wondering what happened.  And so many of the stories were just not long enough to really provide useful insight into anyone's life.  It was like Po had a stopwatch set for 30 minutes and told each person he interviewed to tell them a little about themselves and their career path.      I'm a recent graduate from a non ivy league school.  After majoring in Business, I've been struggling to just simply get experience in the areas of business I like (or any area at this point).  I thought this book would provide stories to which I could relate, but for the most part there were none.  I was hoping for some inspirational stories on what steps I could take to find the right job that would lead to the right opportunities that would make me happy and financially secure.  Instead, many of the people would make tons of money and then simplify their lives by baking cakes or opening a catfish farm which is fine when you're already financially secure.  That also was annoying.  It always seemed like people in the book had to make less money to be happier.  I understand that makes sense in some cases, but the book made it seem like it was the only way.  Even Po kept talking about how he could have made 300 grand a year, but decided against it.  Isn't it possible your calling could lead you to more money?  I am not selfish, money is not everything to me, but I do understand that you do in fact need it.      I gave this book 2 stars, because there was one quote that I did like and made sense to me.  "The true search is what you believe in."  As opposed to only looking at what you're good at.  I think the book needed much more inspirational insight like this.  There were a few other parts of the book that provoked some deep thought, but unfortunately it was more miss then hit.  I wish I could give it 2 1/2 stars, because that would better demonstrate just how down the middle, okay, and simply average the book was.  Don't buy this book expecting it to be an eye opener.      Lets face it, the question "What should I do with my life?" can never be truely anwsered.  It's like pondering about god or the universe.  I just wanted it to make me think "oh wow, that's an interesting way to think about it or approach that question."  Instead, I was almost always left thinking "Um okay, so did I miss something there?" 
 While visiting some family in Utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid-summer weather.  We ended up renting "Analyze That" and boy, what a mistake that was!  We were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999's "Analyze This."  The potential was there, it's not as if writers (of course it's never a good sign to see numerous writers) Peter Tolan, Peter Steinfeld, and Harold Ramis didn't have decent material to work with; Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy.  However, this being Hollywood and all, another sequel was botched.  It's because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation.    Despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding DeNiro and some "fish out of water" situations, the movie seemed to go downhill soon after.  The jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over-the-top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as "Crossroads."  Now either they ran out of jokes, they didn't have enough time to invest in an actual story, or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already ("The Sopranos", "The Whole 9 Yards", "Mickey Blue Eyes", etc. etc.), that there was simply nothing left to write about 
 I mean, come on. The pictures in the original 1973 version of the book were beautiful, it was, like in many childrens' stories, half of the enjoyment. But no...buy the original somewhere else. They've just messed an otherwise great book up 
 Bought this for son when he turned 1 year. He was able able to push the button by 1.5 but the steering does not work. We have taken it apart and put it back together thinking that may be the problem and even put oil on the moving parts. It just doesn't seem to turn well. The mechanism for the steering is flimsy at best -a rod with a hook on the end and its quite frustrating for our little boy.  It also gets stuck easy in grass which is frustrating for all.  I would just wait till they can drive a bigger version. We are looking at purchasing a 12V vehicle now at age 2 
 The Columbia Sportswear story is one of the most compelling business building stories of our time.  However, this books is a totally incomplete treatise.  It is well written and somewhat captivating, but way too summarized if you expect to learn anything useful.  It is a waste of time to read, although you'll only have to waste 20 minutes to read the entire book 
 I can not get over how many bare bones DVD releases of TV shows they're on the market, Good Times being the latest one.  The good news is that each show has been remasterd for great picture and sound quality.  The bad news is that there are no bonus features.  Cmon Now, we buy DVDs to watch the bonus features so we can find out more about the cast and what it was like to work on the show.  A Bare Bones Release like this is nothing more then lazyness on the part of the DVD makers who put this together 
 When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use 
 The authour of this book seems to think that the only single females around are prosperous, white, and urban. The vast majority of single women raising kids do not fit this mold and are certainly worse off for not having a strong father figure in their life. A more apt title would be "How Lesbians and Feminists can Brainwash Chldren into Thinking Fathers are not Important".  I could not imagine how my life would have turned out without all the wonderful strong male role models in my family that were there to correct my wrongs and provid support when it was needed.  Single mothers can raise quality children if the situation dictats but why would you choose to exclude someone so important to a child's development.   Feminists started by toting equal rights, and they triumphed as they rightly should have. Now their agendas push for the abolition of the strong nuclear family and castration of the male youth in this country.  You wonder why American society is breaking down?      
 While I'm driving, this thing doesn't work at all. There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still. Maybe it's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter can't reach it. Overall, I'd say this product is garbage 
 I'm using this in an area where, as usual, there is no map data for the trails and roads. Navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain, to known trails I've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when I should have my chin up navigating. Even then, the functionality is very limited. Seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool, but so far it's only a novelty item. In order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded I will need to purchase the $100 Mapsend software which contains no useful data for me, only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map. A function I can only do on my laptop, something I usually don't carry out into the wilderness.   Basically I bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges, passes, peaks and unknown road systems, while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress. So far it's a 0/5 points in this department.   If you want to find your way back to points this is useful, however for other types of navigation involving linear objects, such as trails and roads, waterways the software isn't there yet 
 Whats the song called and who is it sung by when Brian pulls up to the cafe where mia works, its like a little italian/ spanish love song, plz plz tell me i love it an cant find it 
 After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers 
 I don't support artists who support content protected cds. This is not in the true spirit of music and art.  ENCRYPTED MUSIC TAKES AWAY OUR RIGHTS AS AMERICAN CITIZENS.  STAND UP  FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND DON'T BUY THIS ARTISTS MUSIC 
 DOES NOT WORK ON VISTA.  SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with Vista upgrade (save for the Windows startup music).  I thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back.  Might have, but it says not compatible with Vista.  I guess I'll be getting a new computer.  : 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 The book starts by bringing you straight into the feeling of despair and alienation Elaine and her husband Paul are experiencing in their suburban life. You feel a vague sympathy for them and wonder, "what must be going on in their lives to make them feel so trapped?"  This question is never really answered. The book spends time expressing this depressing state of being in various satirical situations, but never gets beyond the expression of that feeling, which we get from the first page of the book. She offers no insight on why the characters came to feel the way they do, or what they can do to get out of it. As a character portrait all that is fashioned for the protagonist Elaine is the feeling of helplessness; no other aspects of her psyche or personality are defined. We learn nothing about her thoughts, views on the world, personality, or patterns of thinking that may give us a hint as to why she got that way. The same can be said for Paul.   Their environment gives us few clues as well. They live the typical life of a suburban family. They have good kids, good money, and good friends. Since we have seen this story portrayed in many better books and movies before, we can guess what the problems of their environment are. They feel they have to put up a front of stability and happiness for the people they are around, even their closest friends and family. They feel they are only going through the motions of daily life, and following a set of societal rules.   But, the thing is, their lives aren't any worse than anyone else's; in fact, they live pretty good lives. Anyone in any situation anywhere on the planet could be feeling what the characters are. One gets the sense that the author feels this is the general human condition. What this means for us as a race of people is never explored; instead it's dealt with in sloppy, broad strokes, with an ending too dramatic and serious for the scope of the novel. The aspects of the novel that are meant to be ironic and funny are not creative enough to even be clever. Nor are the things that are meant to be shocking at all original enough to have us surprised. Skip this novel and rent American Beauty. 
 The book is great but I have to give only one star, I was very frustrated to keep reading this book, the font are too small and you need a special magnified lens so you will be able to read unless you have a very sharp eyes. Not a good book to read for old people not because of its content but because of it printing style. Not practical to use even with this low price because for me its end up to put this great book aside because I do not want to get blind!!!. this review for 1991 edition 
 The authors take a project management approach to SharePoint.  The book takes you through all the steps necessary when starting a new SharePoint system.  My issue with this approach is that unless you have a reasonable understanding of SharePoint first, it's difficult to grasp the concepts they are explaining.    This would be a good book as a guide to creating a SharePoint system from scratch but you'll be better off getting another book to actually learn the software first. 
 "the nation's failure to offer timely aid to Katrina's victims indicates deeper problems in race and class relations"  The nation only failed to offer timely aid to Katrina' victims because of FEMA's attempts to prevent thousands of volunteers from entering New Orleans to help with evacuation.  "What do politicians sold on the idea of limited governance offer to folk who need, and deserve, the government to come to their aid?"  Considering that it was people sold on the idea of active government who used city-planning and zoning laws to force much of New Orleans below sea level to begin with, I fail to see how the phiolosophy of limited government can be blamed on this to begin with.  "Does George Bush care about black people?"  According to Micael Dyson's logic, he must have since he's a big government "conservative" (anyone who thinks that Republicans and neoconservatives are somewhow any different than Democrats and "liberals" needs a wake-up call.  "that many would be unable to leave because they had no private transportation, yet no means were offered to these urban poor for escape"  Once again, tons of aid and transportation was provided to these people.  FEMA however just wouldn't let these numerous volunteers enter New Orleans to help people out.  "incompetence and antigovernment philosophy, among other factors, made a bad situation even worse."  It wasn't antigovernment philosophy that caused many firefighters to be held up for two days in sexual harassment classes while people were dying.  Michael Dyson is that rare breed of rich, aristocratic fatcat that gains privelidge and prestige from government in order to cover up its f-ups that only cause more pain and suffering to the poor of the world due to statist policies 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 As someone who lived (and, I guess, is still living) the life of a "gifted" person, I'm not terribly surprised by what I found in this book.  Many of the problems held by gifted students originate not from parents but from bureaucrats--people who want to figure out how best to control their talents for profit.  There isn't much profit for the parents themselves, so where's the profit going to come from?  Other than those kids marked by stock brokers and scientists for high-paying jobs, what's left?  Political profit, of course, and this is Quart's real goal.  Quart simply oppresses her topic into non-existence unless it can produce the right kind of person that will be sure to vote the right way.  Scrabble players, spelling bee kids, math geniuses...they're all weird at best and dangerous at worst, *especially* if they've been home-schooled or attend church.  Competitors in chess are hyper-competitive, but (surprisingly?) kids participating in politically-charged poetry slams are "encouraging" and "supportive".  She weeps for school districts that support the gifted and thereby thwart the  "equal results" that certain political groups seek, yet cannot find anything but disdain for programs that support the results of all students  simply (and clearly) because of the political party that happened to begin it.  Her descriptions of her subjects are caricatured so badly that one cannot have any faith in the descriptions.  And, as some have noted below, she has played loose and fast with those she quotes in order to make the right sort of case.  If you have the ability to ignore or refute the author's opinions through basic critical-reading skills, you can get a basic idea of the sorts of issues faced by the gifted.  If not, look elsewhere 
 Picture me [a male] handing this book to a female employee - with encouragement to read...  of course you can't - and i can't as well  
 Advanced Witchcraft my foot. I was so tired of reading "WHen you began your journey, you blah blah blah" This book is basically a checklist of what someone should know to be labeled as an "advanced practioner" by the author. WHen I saw the title, I was excited. I thought finally something new for us who have been practicing for a long time to chew on. I read about half way through and took it back to the store demanding a refund. Ms. McCoy was a good author with several of her first books. I feel she is becoming like Silver Ravenwolf and pumping out books because she has a famous name in the community and can make money by her name alone 
 This book is a DE text for students who've had the misfortune to have been subjected to "reformed calculus"--- i.e., calculus without algebra. There is very little substance here, only high-school level chit-chat and "qualitative analysis" of nearly trivial problems. The writing style is insulting to anyone other than brain-dead pedagogs 
 I find the mostly 5 star reviews of Adam Bede rather puzzling. I am a great of lover nineteenth century English lit, and have enjoyed the other three Eliot books I've read--Middlemarch, Silas Marner, and Mill on the floss, the latter being far and away my favorite. However, had I read Adam Bede first, I may not have bothered to read other Eliot works.   Eliot's talent is indisputable. The other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose, and many of those strengths are present in Adam Bede. What disappointed me most about this work were the characters. Each was far less complex than I have come to expect from Eliot, and I found the saintliness of Seth, Adam, and Dinah boring, almost irritating. It was hard to care about them. I also found, despite the explanations Eliot provided, that Adam's love for Hetty and Dinah's change of heart about marriage was implausible.  What sealed my opinion of this book was Adam's forgiveness of Arthur. After the devastation Arthur's actions caused, it would have been superhuman to forgive him, let alone regard him as a friend. When Arthur asserted that he suffered more than Adam, I could hardly believe that Adam did not recognize yet another expression of Arthur's massive ego.  Despite the book's strengths, this flaw, together with one-dimensional personalities of the main characters, relegates Adam Bede to an inferior status among Eliot's works.  
 This Book's focus seemed to be more about justifying Bill Gates' actions, and defending Microsoft against negative PR than the actual history of Microsoft.  A more fact-filled, play-by-play history of the rise of Microsoft would have been more interesting, I think 
 First, let me just preface this to say that I have read all of the rest of the books in this series and they were excellent. This one, even though the plot was different than the rest and it had great potential failed on several counts.  It was dis-jointed. What do I mean by dis-jointed? It seemed as if several chapters and paragraphs were out of place. For instance, in Chapter 27 Brigadier Sturgeon gets into it with the overall commander and dumbass, General Billie in "yet and another commanders meeting". In the following chapter, they are about to have a commanders meeting AGAIN and Brigadier Sturgeon is asking another General what he can tell him about their new commander and if he has what it takes. One would think that Brigadier Sturgeon, having already had an opportunity to take measure of the idiot in charge would already know and not have to ask.  There are quite a few of these places where it just doesn't seem to flow well in the timeline. And then, then there is the ending. What a weird place to let the storyline go. It just quits. Not even really a cliff-hanger, it just dies.   For the first time since I started this series, I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I enjoyed all of the others and would recommend any of them to friends and family.  Thanks for your time in reading this review 
 Richard Kieninger (RK) Eklal Kueshana), author of Ultimate Frontier (TUF), died in March 2002. He first wrote and published TUF in '63. He presented what is, at its core, a very beautiful yet idealistic philosophy, but also threw in some cataclysmic predictions and an alternative, maybe warped, view of history and metaphysical trivia. Over the years, he has edited and changed various things in TUF. In later editions RK removed some of the predictions/dates, especially when these did not happen. These changes were made in the context of direct quotes of physical in-person conversations that RK allegedly had with human beings who were "Brothers" in a "Brotherhood" working toward uplifting humanity.  Anyhow, to me, the whole TUF/RK/Stelle enterprise is a lot like the movie, "Meet John Doe," made in the late 30's, with young Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. Barbara has been fired from a newspaper, and in her last column, she makes up a story about a "John Doe" who is out of work, down on his luck, and protests the state of civilization and wants to jump off the city hall building at midnight on Christmas Eve. Anyhow, with this lie, the paper actually re-hires Barbara, hires Gary Cooper to be "John Doe," and eventually starts a "John Doe"/"love thy neighbor" movement that sweeps the country. One theme of this movie is that good things can come from a lie.  TUF, in my opinion, is a work of fiction. RK plagiarized the Lemurian Fellowship lessons in writing TUF, and wrote himself a major role in the whole undertaking. With RK's physical death in March 2002, he can no longer have a major role and wreak havoc in other people's lives.  Thank God!    However, there are many many good people in Stelle now, doing many good things.  If you want to learn more about these good things, just go to your search engine and punch in terms, such as Stelle community or Center for Sustainable Community.  The good people who have done good things in Stelle in past and present have done so, in spite of RK and his dramas.   To give you some context, I read TUF in 1980, it was the 2nd edition 1970.  I lived in Stelle from 1983-88 and owned a duplex in Stelle as an investment property from 1993-99.  I do think that the community in general was less uptight in recent years and certainly I think the majority of the good people in Stelle were much less wrapped around RK and his various issues in the later years.     Read TUF, if you want. Just read it cafeteria style, taking what you want and leaving the rest. You can leave most of the RK stuff since he's dead now. 
 Frist of all this is  an okay album don't get me wrong, but I bought it because Johnny Ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really isn't. Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 I thought this play was really poorly written, although I did see it performed, so maybe that tainted my view of it.  But the dialogue between Mags and her parents was just awful and really off beat.  The fact that they did nothing except interrupt each other was obviously a hard thing for Howe to put onto the page, because when real people interrupt each other, they don't wait for the other person to finish their idea.  It seemed very contrived.  Also, important events that happened in the middle of the play were not addressed later when they really should have been.  In my honest opinion, the play should have ended at the end of Act 2, Scene 1, but for some strange reason, it didn't end.  Howe didn't feel the need to put any important events into other scenes in Act 2, but she also didn't want it to end.  That's just bad writing.  If you don't have something important to say, then just end it.  The same thing happened with the first act.  I could have read the second act and still known what was going on.  The first act did nothing to establish the play.  It had some good points, and that's why it received two stars from me, and not zero.  I loved the father's character 
 I was expecting much more than what I got with this "sticker Chart" and it was not worth the $9.75 I paid for it.  You are much better off to purchase the Fisher Price Potty Chair that has a chart & stickers that come with it.  My daughter enjoys that chart & stickers much better & it came free with her potty chair 
 Do not under any circumstances read this book. I love Catherine Coulter and think her books are wonderful but was sadly disapointed with the Valentine Legacy. The caracters are boring, there is absolutly no romance and no sparks between James and Jesse and it makes for a very long and boring book 
 I just read The Divide by the author of the Horse Whisperer, and I wanted to share my opinion of the Horse Whisperer. I did not read the book; I saw the movie, a couple of years ago.  I just remember it being very hoakie, one of the worst movies I had ever seen.  I know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public, but I did not share this enthusiasm.  Don't waste your time on this ridiculous movie 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Maybe it's just the one I got, but my HDMI port seems to be very unreliable.  Most of the time it will be working fine, but once in a while for no reason, the screen goes black and stays black for an extended period of time.  If I switch back to using component cables, it works immediately, but the picture with component cables always looks noticeably worse.  I have tried connecting it to my cable box with 2 different HDMI cables, and connecting it to two different computers with a DVI to HDMI cable.    The same thing happened each time, so I don't think it was the cable or the source of the HDMI input that had any problems.  So basically I'm stuck watching it with component video, which does not look very good 
 DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. Sounds good on paper but throughout the whole film, NOTHING HAPPENS. Unfortunately, I kept waiting for the payoff. Believe me, there isn't one 
 I was in an airport looking for something to read. The selection was thin. Basically there was the NYT best seller rack and Dr. Phil. I generally like political thrillers and Brad Thor's Blowback seemed promising. I never read Thor, or even really know much if anything about him and his work. The book is "ripped from the headlines" which is another way of saying if it's paperback, the plot points are probably dated.   The book was enough to keep my attention from the in-flight Jennifer Anniston movie. After the trip, I found it hard to find the motivation to pick it up and finish it. The hard-boiled military hero is nothing new nor real original. The main antagonist is a cut-throat Democrat Senator "who will stop at nothing" to take down the President. The character is named Helen Remington Carmichael, and the initials aren't the only comparison to a certain New York senator. The effort to frame the character as Clinton is so transparent, it would be ridiculous by itself if the character wasn't ridiculously cartoon-like in partisanship. Needing to demonize a sitting senator in order to make an effective protagonist doesn't say much about Thor's imagination or character development. After a few chapters the wink and nod partisan commentary got old. If you have Ann Coulter on your bookshelf, you may get a few chuckles as Thor gleefully tries in indoctrinate readers, but others who don't share the neo-con ideology will likely find many distractions 
  Lots of interesting explanations. Poor pictures. Total lack of detail to make room for quantity. Cute but no big deal. To the point of boring 
 I used to be a huge Brian Tracy fan.  I always thought of this book as the "master list" of advice because it's so condensed, it has everything you'll ever need to succeed.  Yeah right.  This book is so impractical that it's basically useless.  Tracy quotes list after list.  Some lists actually have sublists!!!!  What the hell.  Tracy will start talking about the three different types of "personal goals" and you'll forget that you're still inside the 7 item list of individual goals  (just an example, I don't recall if those numbers are right, but you get the idea).  On top of that, the advice doesn't really work for me.  Visualizing, Self-Hypnosis, Writing down goals, come on.  Is this realistic?  Is this really what successful people have done to make it?  I kindof doubt it.   I've started reading Robert Ringer.  He's to the point with no BS.  Tracy is not getting another dime from me 
 I picked up this book to read on an airplane. The book should help brand managers understand technology better.  I'm not a techie. But I do understand the basics of IT. I found the book so simple that its ridiculous. The cover and intro seemed appealing. Reading more I find the book empty. This is mostly a book of e-this and e-that and nothing tied together.   The value add is zero. The author makes his money in royalties. The reader gets nothing but rambling nonsense. So many books in this pace, why did I stumble on this one? Dont make the same mistake 
 This is an interesting Seuss book. The moral that it is trying to portray is good, but the story is pretty lame and it doesn't seem to flow as nicely as most Seuss books 
 I read this book on the strength of the author's "See no evil." Worried about a sense of deja vu, I waited five months.  That was not necessary: This book provides little sense of place or character, seeming to depend upon your having read "See no evil" for that.  If it hadn't been for "See no evil", I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  Although the first chapter was promising, I quickly lapsed into speed reading (just short of skimming).  Just over halfway thru, I became so disappointed, I stop reading.  However, my curiosity - inspired by the author's previous work - got the better of me, and I picked it back up and skimmed to the end (encountering nothing to cause me to read for enjoyment).  The book's genre is the spy version of "detective thriller" - the hero runs from place to place collecting information from various "colorful" sources, with various "old friends" providing critical information that would have otherwise disrupted the frenetic pace.  The author does not have the kind of  writing skills needed to pull off a book in this genre.  I expected (and desired) some exposition on Middle East politics, but it often came across as excessive and preachy (obsessive?).  Novels can provide a simplified version of a situation to reveal underlying truths, but this book provides only a simplistic version - readers of "See no evil" may feel insulted, not just disappointed.  I expected that part of the book would center on bureaucratic politics and infighting within the CIA and intelligence community, but what was here was disappointing, poorly set up and very badly rendered.  The ambiguities and uncertainties I would have expected were slight and peripheral to the main thread of the book.  Dialogue is often poorly rendered - it took effort to track which character was saying what - but this was a symptom of the bigger problems.  If you have this problem in an extended exchange involving only two characters, there is a problem with the characters themselves and with the plot point that the dialogue is attempting to advance.  But some of the exchanges were so trite, I didn't bother to make the effort.  Characters are minimally rendered.  The plot is slight.  Transitions between scenes are often jarring.  Too many of the situations strain credibility.  The ending made me feel not just cheated, but betrayed (appropriate behavior for a Case Officier, but not for an author).  Read "See no evil".  Skip this book - It could have just as easily been produced by a writer whose only experience was reading other books in this genre 
 We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex 
 Better than Bloodlines, but still not that great.  Poor character development, and the fact that Conant has a tendancy to ramble make this book less than what it could have been.  I'm also getting rather irritated with the author's constant free advertising plugs for Eukanuba, Iams, and some other major brand names in the pet industry.  Are we reading an novel, or an informational brochure by Iams?  Is she getting paid to do this, or does she really believe that Eukanuba is the best dog food on the market?  (If she does, she's very ignorant on the subject of dog foods.)  I don't like my novels to tell me how I should be training or what I should be feeding.  I probably will not ever purchase any books written by Conant again 
 I initially bought this coffeemaker because I remembered my Dad's Sunbeam Silex type coffeemaker.  It made great coffee and so does the Bodum.  Problem with the Bodum is that I had to send the unit back three times because of leakage in the lower unit between the heating element and the carafe which uses a polycarbonate material.  The folks at Bodum have been very responsive and accommodating but admit that they have not solved this problem.  I am anticipating buying the stove top glass contruction version if I continue to have a problem 
 This book is too generic and full of platitudes, plus poor grammar and typos. The sloppy editing gets worse at the end of the book. For anyone over 40 who has ever done martial arts, there is nothing new here. For anyone who is just beginning in their 40s or later, it is okay but not great. If you are into fitness or are even aware of your body and have anything resembling an active lifestyle, you will be disappointed.   The first four chapters are a waste of space - why fitness is good; the fact that exercise, diet, and mental attitude contribute to health; that most people over 40 resist exercise because it is work and can hurt; etc. Most of the rest of the book discusses the changes in fitness you can expect when you are older, and tells you to keep your chin up and not give up even if tempted. There is also not nearly enough specific information on how to compensate for various physical limitations due to injury, etc. that prevent a full range of motion for many older martial artists.  The only thing I found of value was Chapter 19 Sparring: a few recommendations on how to modify sparring technique to compensate for a loss of power, speed, flexibility, and agility for the older martial artist. Most of it was fairly obvious (circle away from your opponent to avoid being hit!), but there was some good info about disrupting the fight rhythm and using a few simple techniques that you know well and that work for your particular body.   The book finishes with some guidance on meditation and mind/body connection. A good final chapter would have been how to know when to call it quits and stop training for good, or at least change styles to something easier on the body like tai chi.  If I had glanced through this at Barnes and Noble, I would not have bought it. You can have mine 
 Pink Floyd is one of those perfectionist bands- each one of their chords and verses was meant to sound the way it did. Altering the sound just destroys the meaning of the song, which is what the Scissor Sisters did to it. The song has been twisted from a classic  song depicting a battle between Pink and his doctor to a cheesy, disco dancing song that has no meaning. The Scissor Sisters completely missed the point of the song, and made my ears hurt on top of it. For shame 
 This is how ridiculous this book is -- Fredo is gay.  Yep.  No joke.  That is the big hook.  There is absolutely no suggestion of such a preposterous twist in any of the films (not even in the "king of makes no sense" - Godfather III).  But, Windegardner, perhaps simply to shame the franchise - or perhaps just because he is catering to morons that looovvvee reality t.v. -- decides to add in the preposterous.  Needless to say -- I would recommend watching Godfather III before reading this book.  At least with Godfather III, we can at least blame, in part, a studio that refused to pay Duvall.  Weinegardner has no excuses.    
 I bought the "Essential Heart" cd from Tower Rercords this weekend. I just tried listening to it but Track #17 SKIPS and shuts down my media player.  The store (TOWER) is closing down & they refuse to even EXCHANGE IT! They told me to contact the ones who release this album.  All the info. & links on the back of the cd are no longer valid.  I went to SonyMusic and even their links to this cd are defunct.  I was able to find [...]which links back to SonyMusic - but when I call the two "QUALITY MANAGMENT" phone numbers they have, both are defunct and refer me back to the store I bought it from.  I am extremely angry and want my $15 back! No wonder Tower is going out of business with such bad customer service.  All I'm going to be more careful before I buy a Sony/CapitolRecords cd 
 Without trying to give the plot away, let's just admit it: whenever you have any pet or animal in a film, unless it's humane society animal-doting USA film, something very BAD is going to happen.  Out of the three brothers in this film, the middle character has a pet dog.  Enough said.  Our of a boring first 30 minutes of slogging thru this film, I kept my eye on the dog.  After the first 30 minutes we're in with the eldest brother out of prison, played by Stephane Rideau, as it is now his chapter.  Rideau is a blank-stared waste of space here, unfortunate as he's usually the reliable dramatic/quirky/sexy one in other films, I guess the french don't know what to do with him, as he is generally fearless as an actor (even when he is staring into space, there's usually something more intense about it in other films). You think with Rideau in the film SOMETHING has to happen with this guy, but nothing does.  Like all the drama belongs to borderline gang member, brother #2 who shaves his head and entire body, in fact.  Brother #1 just wants to keep his head low and stay out of trouble; still, the career path skyward he takes, leaping over several union employees with seniority to become top dog at the plant, is bordering on fantasy.  btw Is Rideau aging badly or is it just a bad haircut?  As for brother #3 who is rather puppy-in-tow but also obviously the 'delicate, quite, sensitive' of the brothers, you already know what's going on with him before you get to the final segment which is devoted to his personal story, and his relationship with a young arab who loves him, so there's no real surprise, and I'm not sure there's meant to be, as this screenplay is crowded with cliches, including the sensitive youngest brother who still tells his dead mother everything going on in the family, and the eldest who aspires to be a patriarch and is disappointed with his lame father's lack of control over his family.  Why the elder brothers sleep together nude wrapped around each other, is the real mystery and never addressed, as they don't appear to have an incestuous relationship, so we're meant to enjoy the tangle of well-muscled limbs and the visual is only about that.  If you're looking to buy the film for sexual and or nudity content I would advise there's not enough of either to make it worth your while.  There might be some intense aggro for male viewers enjoying films where men are nasty to each other, emotionally and physically, and hence some sort of bonding is implied 
 I am so disappointed in this cutting board.  The first one I got, looked like it had been gouged and used.  I got a replacement easily enough, but this one cracked all the way down the middle the first time I used it and washed it.  I hand washed with a mild soap and water immediately after I used it and even rubbed it with mineral oil.  When I took it out to use again, I discovered it had a crack in it.  Very disappointing and what a waste of my Christmas gift certificate.  Don't buy this, it is junk 
 A little about golf and 'inside the PGA tour'... Plenty of gratuitous language 'n ornery Texans... Mostly about Dan Jenkins' views on relationships with women... Forced a couple laughs 
 It didnt work as good as the teflon curling iron i had a couple years ago, it works just as good as a regular non-teflon curling iron 
 I bought this and one of their wooden pizza peels. I thought it would be ergonomically advantageous, which it may be.    But on the first pizza I cut (on the Mountain Woods peel), the edge is now folded over a bit, rendering the edge much, much less sharp than out of the box.  So, I would suggest you save your $3 and the out-sized shipping costs and buy yourself a cutter that may last for a while 
 Since you are inviting me to submit a review of the book that you have not yet shipped to me, I hope this note will help you to revise -- and improve -- your business procedures.  My rating, therefore, applies to the latter, not the book itself; I would've let the rating field empty had the system let me do so. Yours, BG 
 Very little information of any real help here.  No reviews of current equipment, or help in wiring.  Very basic descriptions of home automation.  Only for the truly dumb 
 Rather than revue the stories, I think it is more important to note that while the English versions might be grammatically correct, the Russian versions are way out of whack. My wife is from Russia, and she has noted more errors than should ever occur in any book.  I can only assume that the writer of the Russian versian was a student of the language rather than a native of Russia. I strongly suggest that you avoid using this book as a platform for for learning the language 
 If I had the option to, I would permanently ban Conway from ever writing another book. She gleefully displays her lack of knowledge on a plethora of topics, from basic Wicca to Ceremonial Magick, to history and mythology, and the list goes on and on. If this book were shelved under fiction, it would be better, but it purports to knowledge that is obviously made up on the spot, with no historical references cited.  In short, buy the book for a chuckle. Serious practitioners of the Craft and the Art should look elsewhere for instruction 
 The Sivulkas' work is a rather long narrative of American advertising -- with very little to offer beyond reproductions of some rather commonplace ads from the last two hundred years.  Much of the information they offer seems to come from other sources, and there is no real bibliography to the book. It is most misleadingly titled "cultural history" since there is so very little to the book beyond a chronology, and that is full of mistakes, over-simplifications, and such bland statements that there is nothing to be learned from this book. Others have written much better and more meaningful  things about the history of advertising, and charged less than [$$] for it 
 I agree with the other reviewers - I was really disappointed. This too slim volume - especially for the price - is designed for a 5 year old - and a simple one at that. Not a good buy - WAY too little info and annoying hand drawn illustrations- all in all a terrible buy 
 Sounds like a great mix, based on a novel by Philip Roth. Mixed race ex-boxer prof (Hopkins) marries out into white community. Pretends he is Jewish. In later life meets screwed up younger white woman (Kidman) with whom he vainly tries to expunge his past. It takes more than eggs to make an omelette, however, and Robert Benton's dreary direction ruins any prospect of a good film. Worst part, Nathan Zuckerman - what on earth was the point of this character - (Gary Sinise). The scene in which Hopkins and Sinise try to dance the slow foxtrot together is one of the daftest and most pointless I have seen in any movie. Best character Ed Harris (Lester Farley) though badly underwritten - why had his relationship with Kidman broken down ? Because he was nuts or she had driven him nuts. She would have me 
 I bought my free-standing heavy bag at a local store and I was very excited to try my new product.  When I got home I was in for a shock.  There were at least sixteen screws, locks, and washers in a little bag.  In addition to that, there was about twelve additional pieces that needed to be put together.  All in all, it took me about two hours to put this puzzle together and eventhough it weighs about 275 pounds once it's filled with water, it does not take much to move it around when striking during a workout.  I need to keep readjusting the base back to its original position every three to four punches I throw on it.  For the amount of money that I paid, this bag should have been put together for me.  I will keep the bag and put it outside.  If somebody steals it, they will be doing me a favor.  Next time I will go with what I know and buy a wavemaster from Century, now that is an awesome product 
 I just got my hands on this book for my master program study. From just reading a couple of chapters, I can see where this book is going. It is clear that the book was published in a rush, and never reviewed properly. The author takes too much time struggling to explain the theory, and when it comes to the example, author simply tells that its obvious, although the theory behind is explained in at least 3 pages. Also, the amount of mistakes I found in this short period is enormous and unbarebale. You start to get lost when following the example and feel you can move forward.   My advise for you, if you are not obliged to buy this book, then don't do so, specially if you look at the price of it 
 Some interesting thoughts, but not at all like real astral travel, and don't get this if you expect to learn astral travel, or progress already existing projection talent.  look into adventures beyond the body by  william buhlman (spelling may be wrong) if you want to begin astral travel 
 i love the colts, but this sweatshirt is supposed to be a large, it is the wierdest fitting sweatshirt i have efer seen. the shoulders are to big and the neck is to tight. i wear a large but i cant wear this shirt because it looks so awkward 
 Wow, this movie was awful.  I am a HUGE fan of "Lilo & Stitch" so naturally I bought this movie sight unseen.  Looks like Disney is just cashing the sequel checks with children being their primary target.  Very low quality story. Stick with Saturday morning cartoons -- at least they're free 
 They have made several changes - some good, most bad -  since I bought my last Sony handicam in 8/2003.  First of all, there is no carrying strap.  This is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera.  I managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain. The docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer, you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes. This messes up my editing program.  Fortunately I still have my old camera.  The ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge.   While I was told most people prefer to use the LED screen (I don't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you can't see clearly in bright sun) I like to use the viewfinder.  It no longer has a tilt up feature so I end up mashing the battery into my cheek.  This last complaint is about the batteries. Sony LIED about the amount of time that a battery will hold.  The 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera. That's slightly more than 3 hours; It is nowhere near 5 hours.  The 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either. Their packages should be accurate.   All in all, It is not as good as the older product.  There also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec. button is not being pushed.   THIS WILL BE MY LAST SONY UNLESS THEY MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS 
 This was a good product for a few weeks and kept my babe warm. BUT...the zipper does not work well and it broke already. I tried to repair it, but after that broke, the quilting came apart and was too much trouble to fix. I would not recommend this JJ Cole product as I had the same problem with another one we inherited 
 I agree with the reviewer who felt that Ms. Shires's textual analysis didn't flow well.  I found the majority of this book to be rather dull, tedious, slow-going, and uninvolving.  It was an original idea to tell the story of her conversion by relating issues she had difficulty with or areas she found inspiration in to certain passages of Torah and the similar writings of others, but it just didn't seem executed well.  If this is supposed to be a conversion memoir, why does so little of the book actually concern her conversion or even her herself?  The sections when Ms. Shires is writing about herself, such as in the beginning section, the ending chapter about her visit to her husband's native Germany, and the middle chapter about the mikvah, are quite good and interesting, because they're actually related to her life and to her conversion and not just tediously rambling on about certain Torah passages.  From reading this, it seems as though she were the classic child who does not know enough to ask.  She says she did a lot of reading prior to her conversion because she really wanted to know the religion and to approach it from a variety of disciplines, but in many sections she admits that she didn't know about some pretty important things or issues till after she converted.  For example, she says that she hadn't had a lot of education about the mikveh and had been too embarrassed to ask her converting rabbi, and therefore went into her conversion day feeling she had to immerse herself because she was thought to be "contaminated" and "dirty" as a non-Jew and had to cleanse herself before being admitted to the tribe.  How could anyone in any denomination, particularly if she's had such a long process of education and learning as Ms. Shires evidentally had, reach conversion day thinking such a thing and not having learnt more about the custom of mikveh?  (I was also annoyed that her chapter on the mikveh used the dated and inaccurate translations "contaminated" and "unclean" for the Hebrew words "tumah" and "tamei."  That continues to give the completely false impression that menstruating women are thought to be dirty and unclean, when in actual fact the words surrounding this state of being are translated more like "ritually impure," and the impurity refers to a spiritual, not a physical, state of being.)    I was also left wondering why she converted under the auspices of the Conservative Movement when she so clearly feels ill at ease with many of their official positions, or at least the positions her own community seems to take.  She really seems like she'd feel more at home in a Reform, Reconstructionist, or Renewal community.  I'm also baffled as to why she frequently says that the Conservative Movement hasn't done enough for the inclusion of gays and women, unless her community isn't as liberal as many other Conservative communities are.  Or are the changes of the past few decades not radical and sweeping enough for her?  I also share her belief that women, gays, the disabled, and other groups that traditionally haven't always been included fully in Jewish life need to be completely integrated and granted full equality and participation in the community, but at times her call for this reads more like a political polemic and speaking from personal experience as opposed to really representing the great strides the Conservative Movement has made in these areas in the past few decades.  I'm not doubting her personal experiences with people she's known and what she's dealt with in her own community, but it just seems baffling if she's trying to say the entire Conservative Movement takes those positions as well.  A couple of interesting chapters do not a very recommendable book make.  Most of this was just very slow going for me, and the divrei Torah weren't that novel or insightful either.  I've heard most of these interpretations and analyses before, only not in such dull language.  I'm actually disappointed I bought this book, though at least I got a cheap used copy.  I'd looked forward to reading a conversion memoir, but instead got a tedious exercise in boredom that had almost nothing to do with the author's life, either before, during, or after her conversion 
 If there is a passage that defines this book, it's the one on page 74, where he uses his superior intellect and social conservatism to declare that "...[the human assembler of pre-manufactured parts] is not necessarily a bad man. It merely means that his education in his trade has been bad."   What an amazing nugget of wisdom from a man who browbeats the greater population for our consumption of mass-manufactured objects. No, David, assemblers who aren't emotionally or pridefully connected to the object are just deficient people, worthy of the utmost contempt. Start up a death camp if they bother that bad, Nazi bastard. Labor thanks you for your morsels of understanding and forgiveness.  Don't waste your money. Don't make ugly work 
 Conscious Acts of Creation: The Emergence of a new Physics by William A. Tiller, Walter E. Dibble, and Michael J. Kohane.  Publisher: Quality Books Inc. pages - 418  I like and don't like this book. It's billed as a book written for physics, but also applicable to people into metaphysics. But the problem is that the writing for this book is not intended for a general audience. It's intended for an audience that has a developed awareness of the highly technical language of physics and math. As such many people into metaphysics will have a hard time reading this book. I did. I had to read and reread many sections to try and understand the language being used.  A big part of the problem is that the organtization of this book's chapters is highly erratic. The authors jump around a lot. I actually understood a few of the final chapters, but only because the language was more general. I think it would have served the authors better to have put those chapters in the beginning of the text. Also none of the terms and acronyms were well defined or spelled out. A glossary would've done wonders for this book.  In defense of the book the ideas being worked with are intriguing and the authors did perk my interest and keep me reading...the problem is that while this book could interest a large audience of people, it can only have a big impact on a much smaller audience because of the highly technical language, bizarre layout, and lack of cohesion. As such the potential good this book could do is marred by the inability of the authors to write in a more accessible manner.  I did manage to understand a fair amount of this book, but I can only chalk that up to reading up a lot on physics and science. I only hope that the authors' other books are more accessible.  Regrettably I have to give this book two stars out of five and recommend to the authors that they work with an editor who can help them with layout issues and with language (in terms of making the language more accessible to a wider audience) 
 Kozol spews his normal emotional stuff but fails to get to the underlying problem: government-provided goods always have at least 2 out of 3 features: they cost a lot, they are low in quality, and they harm the poor. Government education wins the Trifecta: it does all three.  If someone said that lower income people who get food stamps should have to spend their food stamps in government run supermarkets, we would see the idiocy: government has no edge in producing or distributing food. Well, now we have government giving education stamps but saying they have to be spent in government run education stores. Kozol has no right to be shocked. 
 As a Bob Dylan aficiondo, I decided to add this one to the home library...Big Mistake. The quality of the photos are substandard and appear to be taken by an amature photographer. Also, I agree with the previous review regarding the irrelevant text that drifts aimlessly throughtout the entire book, complete waste of time. Marsh & Gilbert's attempt to unload mediocre material is very clear to any true enthusiast. Save yourself the money and disappointment.   
 Ms. Estefan sings a collection of oldies here, and NONE of them have anything unique to offer in the way of clever arrangements or an individual point of view. "Cherchez La Femme", the great song originally recorded by Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, is virtually identical, minus the pizzaz and sass. It is transformed into a bland vehicle for Estefan. Ditto "Turn The Beat Around". What is the point of copying the original musical and vocal arrangements so closely that it renders the remake utterly pointless? Why listen to these cheezy remakes when the originals are the real deal? Keep these questions in mind, and before you invest in this hollow exercise, seek out the originals, and leave this empty collection alone 
 Wow, did someone slip the wrong CD into my jewelbox or what?  If you're a fan of Allison's other work, epect nothing like what you've heard before.  This is mostly a pop album, and the songs that could have been saved are ruined by the awful engineering.  The sound is way over compressed and artificial sounding.  Even Allisons voice has no drive to it.  Steve Earl is no match on the guitar for Joe McMahan who played on the Show CD/DVD.  
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 I purchased this book with the hope of getting some interesting stories and activities that I could use with my reluctant readers. I was disappointed that the stories, with few exceptions, were bland and uninviting. I was also disappointed with the activities accompanying the stories. All activities encouraged students to imagine a scenario like the one in the story and, using a litery device, write their own narratives. There are no sample essays, narratives, or stories for the students to look at as they begin their own writing. In fact, there are no student activities beyond the writing prompts. Overall, I was disappointed in the lack of innovation and variation in both the stories and the accompanying activities 
 Detailed autobiography (though 3rd person) of the celebrity she thinks she is. If you can get through it - good luck 
 I really didn't enjoy this book. The writing was somewhat confusing, and there were pages missing. A better job of proofreading should have been done 
 Jackson is no Bob Klein, but no beer writer can be.  However, this book is  not bad as long as one doesn't expect too much.  Hardly the authoritative  resource it purports to be and tends to be pretentious 
 Don't you all really want some kind of variety in your life. All the guys in Dipset are making the exact same songs over and over on different albums. There isn't anything original to what any of them are doing. When will you get tired of hearing about what these kats bought or what they are riding in? Most people are so wrapped in what they own that they don't even look at the skills of the rapper. Then most of the time the stuff you are mesmerized by, they don't own it they just rented it for the video. These guys have no talent and are flushing decent beats down the toilet 
 San Francisco: 4 Romances Blossom by the City by the Bay is a compilation of four short stories: Grace in Action, Landlord Takes a Bride, Meet My Sister Tess, and Unbreakable Hope. The stories were written from 1999 to 2003, and all of them are very Christian in theme and writing. The first story, Grace in Action, is about a fireman and a very poor woman and her child. The fireman befriends the woman and begins to date her, much to the sadness of his girlfriend Emily. In fact, Emily shows up in the last story, Unbreakable Hope. The first and last stories are a slight continuation of one another and have characters that overlap. The best story, in my opinion, was The Landlord takes a Bride - both the male and female characters were strongly written, and the emphasis on church, God, and Christianity was less intense. The weakest story was Meet My Sister, Tess; it is about an adult female taking care of her disabled adult brother, and not being able to function independently of a man. Because Tess is so poor and her brother is disabled, the references to God were all over the place - it was actually very tedious to read through and I was just wanting it to end. This writer is not particularly good; the stories are about 50-75 pages each but are not intense enough to grab your attention and make you want to continue reading. The setting of San Francisco played a very minor role in the book, and the cover gives the impression that the stories will pay tribute to the city. They didn't; the author mentioned very few places in the city and it wasn't exploited at all. It's a shame, because perhaps the book would have been better with more focus on the setting and less on God and Christianity. I would definitely skip this book 
 Disc Picture: As intended by the filmmakers, the stylized VC-1-encoded 1.85:1 HD DVD picture features differing color schemes depending on the location. The entire presentation is void of highly resolved fine details.  Soundtrack: The Dolby® Digital Plus 5.1-channel soundtrack is not overly exciting, although bass is delivered well through each of the channels, although the noise floor is low, dialogue and effects are generally well recorded, and the sound matches the storytelling nicely. 
 This has got to be the worst book I've ever read. How convenient that Amazon lists the good reviews first. That means most people won't read this. However, I'll give my two cents worth anyway. Several previous reviews state this book is funny, it's not! The book has no plot, no ending, and only a very fragmented, mostly deranged stream of thought in between. I can only guess that Ms. Smith was trying to be clever with her rambling list of web sites, use of etc. every few lines and endless droning on about cliches. It all falls flat because it all leads to no where and nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Save your money for something by a different author 
 These are definitely not my thing.  The chocolate and toffee flavor is WAY too strong; if I'd have wanted hot cocoa I would have ordered it!  However, if you're a big fan of gas-station cappuccinos - these may appeal to you 
 Mark Steyn in Broadway Babies Say Goodnight (Musicals Then and Now) has accomplished an unique objective.  He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance.  Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about.  For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog.  It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless.  This book is not truly bad.  It is just simply odd.  If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy.  Othewise, it is worth a pass 
 I never wear this top after having purchased it.  The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them.  The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly.  I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and, therefore, isn't very flattering.  I think I've worn it once and will probably donate it soon.  Generally, I have been pleased with Adidas products, but this shirt did not work for me personally.  
 I bought this book a number of years ago for apologetics purposes-- While I would agree with other reviewers that it holds a high view of Scripture, and the book definitely represents a lot of research, I think that the approach to symbology used here can be problematic.  The entire book is a study of constellations,  and how they display the Gospel in the Stars. While this is an interesting study I think there a oouple of underlying problems with this approach.   1.  Constellations and star names are simply assignments that man has assigned to stars.  Usually pagan cultures in association with their pagan mythology.  Although this does not completely undermine such a study it does call it into question. 2.  A second more serious problem is the same problem which underlies numerology and other allegorical approaches-- they can often be made to say anything the author even while at the same time appearing scholarly.    Those looking for apologetics in the cosmos should consider investigating the "anthropic principle" which tracks evidence of God's design of the universe.  One such book would be "Show me God" by Fred Hereen.  In terms of our faith, In my opinion, God's Word itself furnishes a lifetime of study without engaging in speculation of symbols which we really can't prove one way or the other.  
 If you haven't read Adele Davis's groundbreaking work Let's Eat Right To Keep Fit, have not come across other low glycemic, whole food diets and aren't familiar with Dr. Christian Northrup's work, I suppose this book is helpful. Otherwise, I'd put my money elsewhere.  The book is written well enough and it does have alot of information. The problem is that the information has been around a long time.  Most of us are now quite familiar with the benefits of low glycemic impact, whole foods, "good" fat, etc. I don't see the value of yet another book on the subject.  One of my main problems with the work, however, is the large number of supplements (which Dr. Perricone sells, of course) that one is supposed to take in order to reap the full benefits of his "promises." While each may offer some benefit, just the logistics of taking all of them in the proper combination (some need to be taken with food, some not) at the proper time (some can't be taken after a certain time because they interfere with sleep) would daunt even the most determined.   Not to mention the expense! They can be purchased at discount stores but they're still extremely expensive.   But perhaps I'm prejudiced. I prefer books that offer information without the contamination of vested interest. This one comes across as much less informational than infomercial, heavy on the "mercial", light on the "info."  A much better choice in my opinion would be Peter D'Adamo's Eat Right 4 Your Type. Published in 1996 it's as valid today as it was 10 years ago. It's an interesting read and a good all-around book on individualized nutrition.  
 I borrowed this book from the library, as I have been very hesitant to spend the money on Cat Who books lately.  This one has set the seal on it, though...I don't even want to read them any more.  Even Koko and Yum Yum have been made totally uninteresting.  This is a series which should have retired on a positive note because so many people enjoyed it.  Instead, the publisher has run it into the ground through sheer incompetence.  I hope there is some poor lowly soul at Putnam whose job it is to read customer feedback and pass it on to the fools in charge...maybe they will finally let this series rest in piece 
 I expected this book to be a satire comparing the ridiculous actions of some wealthy people to similar behaviors found in the animal kingdom. When the book sticks to its satirical purpose it somewhat succeeds, though I didn't find Conniff as funny as all the blurbs describing his "wittiness' would suggest.  But where I had a problem with this book is its one-sided perspective on human behavior, which Conniff attempts to explain through the very narrow lens of "biology as destiny." Now don't get me wrong, I definitely believe in Darwin's theory of evolution and the other basic ideas of science that have been proven through the "scientific method" of serious research and collected evidence. But, as most people would agree, BOTH nature and nuture play a part in human development. In other words both culture and biology are important factors in why humans behave as we do. This, to me, is common sense. But Conniff comes across as overly ideological in his biologically deterministic perspective. This is especially the case when he takes his jabs at feminists and others with a more "culturally based" point of view. I think there is much to be learned about humanity from studying the sciences. But I also believe in drawing from other ideas and academic disciplines in order to form a balanced basis of knowledge. Conniff fails to do that and for that reason I find his book does not ring true.  
 I thought this book was dull and disappointing.  If you are looking for just a bit of light reading for the sake of a story, this may be the book for you - but if you are looking for a novel that is intriguing, moving and involving, this certainly didn't make the grade for me.  The writing is dull, the characters are flat, the plot moves along like a simplistic fantasy with the characters making their choices with an unrealistically shallow level of conflict.  I personally found I was unable to empathise with any of them because I felt they just weren't real to me, despite the book's issues being quite close to my heart.  It's magazine-rack stuff 
 i expected better durability out of this fan. It died after just 3 months, and had flow problems from day one.  I tried contacting Lasko but got no responses. 
 The school of bodybuilding this book teaches is very outdated.  Save your money!  Don't buy this book.  I was following the instructions in this book and I gained thirty pounds...in fat!  That's right, it tells you to eat anything.  You heard me, ANYTHING.  In the old school way, the bodybuilder eats whatever he wants to gain mass and later on sheds off the fat through aerobic exercise.  The problem with that is, during the rigorous aerobic training, much muscle mass is also lost with it.  The new way of bodybuilding (which makes alot of sense) stresses to eat alot and eat LEAN while you train.  It does offer some great exercises but nothing you can't get from other good weight training books 
 By focusing on the separateness of the two individuals in unifying marriage, this book will only encourage the divisions that it seeks to stop. Claiming a form of biblicalness by referring to biblical passages but missing the biblical model of marriage, they write a book that will harm many a Christian marriage. Their thesis is that many of the post marital problems comes because Christian couples naively assume that when two become one they will truly be that: one. No, they say, they remain to be two and the only way to keep the troubles out are to define boundaries of each's individuality from the onset.   You hear none of this in the Bible. Rather you read, 'What God has joined together let no man separate.' Marriage is designed by God to be a supernatural unifying to two individuals, much like in the trinity, indeed the best picture of this unity that the world can see. 'Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.' A selfless love by the husband will keep conflicts to a minimum because he leads, not by following his own desires, but by looking out for her best interest. 'Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.'   Rather than saying that our conflicts are because we are rebelliously living outside of God's plan for marriage, 'Boundaries in Marriage' says that we just need to give each other their space. Some of the suggestions are wise and would help to make a more godly marriage, but not because we are honoring each others' individuality, but because they involved thinking of the other.   If you are just newly married or have been married for a while and are looking for some practical advice on making your marriage a better agent for God's glory I would recommend: For wives - The Excellent Wife: A Biblical Perspective by Martha Peace For husbands - Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God by C.J. Mahaney For couples - Reforming Marriage by Douglas Wilson (although I do not agree with one-size-fits-all applications on areas such as homeschooling) 
  "BRUTAL PLANET"  REVIEW:   In Alice Cooper's long and successful career (admittedly with ups and downs along the way), he has proved (to me at least) that he is one of the best lyricist in rock and roll history. Albums like "Love It To Death," "Killer," "Billion Dollar Babies," and "Welcome To My Nightmare" are just simply put - BRILLIANT. Alice was at the top of his game in the 70's. However, that is not to suggest that he's never released worthy material since then. In fact the quite opposite. Albums like his 1983 hidden gem "Dada," 1991's "Hey Stoopid" and the brilliant "The Last Temptation" (1994) is amongst some of Alice's best work.  However, in the summer of 2000, Alice unleashed BRUTAL PLANET, which was produced by Bob Marlette (Union - "The Blue Room") and executive produced by the great Bob Ezrin. While there are standout tracks like the title track, "Sanctuary," and "Take It Like A Woman" --- the album just falls flat. The new musical direction (Nu-Metal) seems too forced which is truly unfortunate because the album boasts some of the best lyrics Alice has ever written.   MUSICIANS:  Ryan Roxie ... Guitars Phil X ... Guitars China ... Guitars Bob Marlette ... Bass Eric Singer ... Drums  INTERESTING FACTS:  1. Released by Spitfire Records, "Brutal" Planet" peaked at #193 on the Billboard Top 200.  2. There was a Japanese/Australian bonus track called "Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me". That title was actually inspired by dialogue spoken in the hit animated show "The Simpsons".  3. The stage show - which can be seen on the "Brutally Live" DVD - is a post-apocalyptic landscape of wreckage that also features the Frankenstein machine, a Guillotine, two TV`s - and in some cases - three TV's showing weird video footage all through out the show.   PACKAGING:  The album cover - which was created by Kane Roberts' company PlanetFX - is a decent and once again, the booklet does feature  the album's lyrics.  APPROX. RUNNING TIME:  48 min. and 4 sec.  FINAL ANALYSIS:  Musically the album just plods along and is devoid of any real energy. Despite being lyrically well-written, "Brutal Planet" is certainly the most disappointing release from Alice since his 1989 album, "Trash". **1/2 out of 5.      
 I agree with a previous review that you get what you pay for.  But in the future I would highly recommend paying more once instead of having to replace this food in a few months or so.  We received this as a gift and from the outside it looked like an great choice!  I was very happy.  But we have had this package of food for about one week and I am already taping boxes with packaging tape to keep them together.  Little hands can pull apart the milk, juice and snack boxes in no time.  The cans of food are so small that they topple over easily in the play kitchen.  The pies, pizza, and such food are all actually hollow underneath.  There is no base to them.  They tell you 101 pieces but in our kit it counted 8 hotdogs (without buns), 12 individual french fries and the same on potato chips.  Not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets in a french fry container and you get a hot dog in a bun separately.  Why would my child want four jalepenos too.  So much of this food is not they type of thing a small child would be familiar with.  Anyway, in my opinion spend the money on a smaller quantity of higher quality food or go online and find the "vintage" Fisher Price or Little Tikes food.  Now those are made to last and of good size for small hands.  
 Having listened to Outkast since Southernplayalisticadilacmusik came out in the early 90's, I have always been excited when they drop a new album. They have always pushed the envelope and pushed hip-hop in new directions, opening new doors. But, this album simply didn't work.  There are highlights, but overall, this is a very uneven album. Most Outkast albums standup to repeated listening (Aquemini hasn't left my CD-changer since the day it came out) but most of this album gets tiresome after a few listens. Only "Church" stands up to repeated plays. The rest of the album should be taken in small doses. "Ghetto Music", "Tomb of the Boom", and "Last Call" are fun songs that I like to hear occasionally when I'm in the mood for some loud, big-beat club-style hip-hop. While "the Love Below" is certainly interesting, Andre's experimentation falls flat for the first time in his career. There are no real standout tracks on this second CD though most are listenable, but leave you thinking "Hmmmm, that was interesting and I respect you for trying something new, but..." You just aren't tempted to push that play button again right away. Compared to the hip-hop that generally gets radio airplay today, this album is better, but compared to Outkast's other work, it is a huge letdown. Southernplayalisticadillacmusik was a tempting showcase of talent that foreshadowed the good things to come, but it was pretty standard fare for southern rap at the time, although done better than most with a few hints of experimentation. (3 1/2 stars). Outakast really broke through with ATLiens with stripped down beats and ambient highs and thoughtful lyrics (5 stars). Aquemini (5 stars since that's the highest mark, but it deserves more) marked the highwater point of Outkast's career thus far. It was (and still is) an absolutely amazing album that can be held up as a standard against which others can be measured. (Only Goodie Mob's "Soul Food" is on a similar level in my opinion.) Stankonia was a bit of a drop off after Aquemini, but still an extremely solid effort with some standout tracks like "Gasoline Dreams" and "Humble Mumble." (4 Stars). But, with this latest release, Outkast seems to have lost some of the edge that made their earlier albums so great. I respect Outkast for constantly trying new things (that is what made ATLiens and Aquemini instant classics) and can understand that sometimes expiramentation will not go as planned. Given that, I look forward to thier next album and hope they can recapture the magic that made their second and third albums so amazing 
 Wow... was I surprised after seeing all of the reviews... I hate this CD... It has to be the worst choice I've made in 5 years... this CD should have never been linked to any suggested site other than garbage.. Oops!! my bad.. I like the band Garbage... what a huge waste... huge.. 
 Got "When Jolson Was King" today. What a disappointment. It's the kind of book you can read straight through at one sitting. Not because it's so engrossing, but because there's so little there.   I had hoped for a history of the Jolson era, placing him and his achievements in context and including comments by those who were there. Instead there were often entire (two or three page) chapters on peripherally related people or places without even a relevant Jolson citation. The writing is uninspired and often in need of proof-reading. There are short semi-biographies of Jolson contemporaries, often including only a  sentence  or two of quotes concerning Jolson. Plus many pages devoted to contemporary Jolson Tribute Artists who are well intentioned and complimentary, never actually met the man.   Sorry, but it's a waste of money. 
 This remote controller was quite a dissapointment.  I am using two other Philips/Magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better.  This one does not look like the picture (which looks more like the 425 model).  It does not cover the equipment I have (while the 425 model does), It's learning mode is flaky and unreliable, to say the least. The range is shorter then that of the 425S.  Conclusion:  This would make for a nice ornament (It does look nice, and, if you are lucky you may be able to control  some devices.  
 Leave this one "on the shelf"!! A "Hotwheels" product which doesn't come with "wheels"!????!!!  Who would have thought at $25.00 it doesn't come with a car and then they have the nerve to make it not work with other Hotwheels cars!! This is a very annoying junk toy which was such a disappointment to my son Christmas morning.  I would not have been so disatisfied had I shopped on Amazon and got it for the price being offered now--$5.00!!  
 This book was a big disappointment. Unfortunately, Mr. Leddick is neither  a scholar nor a very good story teller.  His work is poorly documented, and  provides little social context for the subjects' milieu.  I was also  disappointed in the book's failure to convey any historical context as the  bits and pieces of the subjects' lives were scantilly discussed.  Although  he succeeds in giving the reader a rough synopsis of the lives of Lynes,  Cadmus and Kirstein (at least covering the period of time that Lynes was  alive), he conveys little understanding of the artistic contributions of  each or how these men or their artistic contributions were interconnected.   The book makes it seem that the three were only "intimate  companions" through a loosely defined group of cocktail party  habitués, hardly a basis for a meaningful "triography".  One  wonders why Leddick chose these three as worthy of a joint writing.  It  appears that a biography of each would have included little material about  the others.  I would have thought a "triography" of George Platt  Lynes, Monroe Wheeler and Glenway Westcott, who lived in a ménage à trois  of sorts, would have made far more interesting reading, as would a  "triography" of Paul Cadmus, and Jared and Margaret French.   Instead, the reader comes away from "Intimate Companions" starved  to read a well-documented exposé of each of these men's lives and artistic  contributions 
 This was a very disappointing product.  I think it is a great idea - and bought 3 of them to give as Christmas presents.  I'm returning 2 because it is useless.  The dictionary is way too limited. During my first day of use, I looked up seven words and three were not in the dictionary. All three are readily available in my regular dictionary. All of the resources spent on games, address book, etc. would have been better spent on improving the dictionary 
 I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS MOVIE AND I WAS CHARGE FOR IT  I WOULD LOOK TO RECEIVE THE DVD  THANK YOU  CAN SOMEONE EMAIL ME WITH THIS INFO rossannemccullough@hotmail.com or call me at 312-404-0267 my name is ROSSANNE MCCULLOUG 
 I have a fairly extensive collection of comedy albums, and I gatta say this is probably one of the lamest I've ever heard. If you enjoy hearing a one-line joke dragged out to 5-6 minutes (like the worst episodes of SNL), then maybe this is tolerable. maybe ONCE. The people giving this high ratings are either Norm's friends or people too young to have experienced true wit. Trust me, if you listen to this once you will probably never play it agai 
 I was given this book for free by the owner of a bookstore when I told him that that I was starting a bookstore.     I learned maybe, oh, 5 or 6 things that were slightly important.  I especially learned how radically the bookmarket has changed in such a short period of time, and how mired in the past this book is (even with it's new chapter on the Internet).   In any business, there will always be a middle man- but the face of the middleman in the book business is so changed that it is tough to write a book that stays current.   For the young bucks starting in the industry, do subject and content searches of discussion boards hosted by the big bookselling pages: amazon.com (most useful), and abe.com.  Getting a part time job doing grunt work (shelving, cleaning) at a local used bookstore will provide you with more practical education in a day than this book will.  
 I can't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video "easy to master".  I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow.  The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork!  I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner.  I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough!  I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much.  She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be.  The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves.  I hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 This Workbood back-fired.  The theory appears sound, but when it came to my wife and me working through the Workbook together, we found a serious trap (surely unintended) by diligently following the instructions, exactly.  Session 7 is entitled "Re-Romanticizing your Relationship I:  Caring Behaviors."  It directs each person to list the behaviors he/she has "always wanted but have never asked for."  The instructions then elaborate by saying the wants may be "your vision of a perfect mate...may be private fantasies or secret desires."  They fail to limit the scope.  There are some behaviors over which a person may have no control such as medication side-effects or physiological depression.  Following the instructions blindly and trusting they allow for and deal with such situations. I honestly included some desires that my mate is unable to provide. These lists were then exchanged. She appeared to accept them at the time, but they actually caused her a great deal of anguish.  So my wife now knows my fantasy wants but she cannot fulfill them even though she would very much like to.  This left her feeling inadequate to the point she gave me an "out" of our relationship of many years.  That is the last thing I would ever want.  As a result, I am quite angry and feeling very guilty.  Looking ahead to the next sessions, not only do they not deal with this type of possibility, but they use these lists to intensify the exercises.  I should have known better.  We threw the books in the trash.  We have  spent a good deal of time overcoming those feelings of hurt and regret.  From the beginning, I have had trouble with the title as, to me, "wants" has its roots in selfishness 
 This book was a waste of time to read.  It comes down to this,  eat sensibly and in moderation, exercise and the weight should come off.  If you only have 10 pounds to loose, I wouldn't recommend it.  It seems like this book is geared torwards people who have a lot of weight to loose.  If I followed this diet, I would be famished.  Eat when you hungry, why wait for the "miracle" three hour?  I just don't get it.  I think the book was also more about joining Jorge's website 
 I wanted to like this book, but I had to give up in the end. If the overall vignette concept is attractive enough, the execution of detail isn't -- Kosinski can't write. He tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important, whereas the reader is always expected to discover "depth" in simplicity. Nothing to be recommended for 
 I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. I have read a couple other books on general dog training, and this one offered absolutely nothing new above what I had seen before. The case studies presented about dogs  retrained at the author's institute struck me as nothing more than a  blatant advertisement. If you have no experience with dog training  whatsoever, then maybe you will find this book useful. But if you already  have some knowledge of basic training and are looking for some advanced  insight and more effective ways to deal with canine aggression, save your  money. The information here is too superficial 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 Let me just say if a movie gets it premiere on the Scifi Channel is doomed from the start. An who the hell thought that having Corey Feldman as a mad scientist is a good ideal.Having Cory doing anything is a bad ideal. Any ways Corey attempts to recreate the formula and bring the puppets back to life,all the while the head of a toy corporation has made a pact with the devil in hopes of bringing forth chaos and destruction on Christmas Eve the help of the formula. Naturally she attempts to steal the formula. Basically towards the end we get to finally see the lame match up between the toys. For some reason they decided to change the look of the original Demonic Toys but keep the same look of the Puppet Masters ones. Eithier way, the new look is horrible. Despite what attempt at horror they try to deliver, they come off simply as an annoyance.Probably the most intresting aspect of this dribble would be the upgrade they made to the Puppet master toys receive towards the end. What could have been a fun cheesy ride of a film turned out to be a long segment of some lost Are You Afraid of the Dark episode on Nickelodian. This is just made for TV trash. horrible cast,acting,directing and script, do not even bother a second on this crap. 
 The chefs asked to relate their biggest catastrophes seem to have misunderstood that direction. Instead, most of them have used this forum to impart their bottomless pits of wisdom, and stroke their own egos at the same time. Aside from a couple (trust me, only about two were real culinary catastrophes) of anecdotes, this book was  monotonous. The "catastrophes" consisted of chefs relating their travel experiences in France, "how-to" advice for starting your own restaurants, and other stories that have really nothing to do with culinary catastrophes. Most frequently the chefs would include a moral of the story at the end of his/her piece.   The only two worthwhile stories are from Tony Bourdain and the Two Hot Tamales.   Don't buy this book. Go to the bookstore and read the two stories I mentioned above. It will take about ten minutes and make you laugh. If you buy this book and read the whole thing, it will take you hours to read and in the end you will cry that you spent money on this literary catastrophe 
 After reading the table of contents, I purchased this book, expecting it to be a dispassionate history of famous economists.  By the middle of the text however, I came to realize that the author was embedding within his extensive knowledge of economic history his unabashed distaste of free market capitalism.    The premise of the book, (and of the title), is that the great fallacy of Adam Smith (and most other economists) is that they offer nothing to deal with the supposed immoral gap between the rich and poor.  While R. Stone (above) addresses this point by pointing to the fact that Smith does in fact discuss this issue at length in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, I prefer to address it from a different direction.  Foley's argument, focusing on the wide gap existing in capitalist societies between the rich and poor completely overlooks the absolute gains made by all under free market societies, versus their socialist counterparts.  Paraphrasing the great Thomas Sowell, economics is not a system of morals, but rather a means by which scarce resource which have alternate uses are rationed most efficiently.  Chapter three most clearly shows the author's bias, in his glowing description of socialism, which in the end only euphemistically discusses the political difficulties in administering such a society.  Page 204 is perhaps the best example of this bias:    "Furthermore, the Soviet Union did indeed manage to organize an impressive spurt of economic development, extension of the division of labor, and growth of productive capacity through its central planning mechanisms for what turned out to be a period of sixty years".  Nowhere in the text did Foley describe the now infamous rotting food in villages neighboring areas of starvation in the USSR.  He does not mention the dominant theory among respected economists that the surplus value created by a capitalist society, and unevenly distributed to a certain class is what creates the incentives for goods (like food) to be distributed to the populace.  Above all else, he does not ever mention the abject human rights violations ubiquitous in socialist regimes such as China under Mao, Cuba, USSR, etc.  Granted, these abuses of power are not part of the system of socialism, but it is interesting nonetheless that they so often occur in societies which embrace their tenants.  Chapter five's description of Keynes was most interesting, in my opinion, for the strong weight Foley gave to his assertion that Say's Law is wrong, thereby destroying the theories of free trade, and opening the door to protectionist tariffs.  What was notably missing from this discussion, however, were stats on the falling unemployment rates for *both* the US and Mexico in the years after Clinton signed NAFTA, or the continuously dropping unemployment rates, and job creation in recent years, during extensive outsourcing.  Nor does Foley treat the Great Depression with any objectivity.  After describing the horrible conditions the US and world were facing in the thirties, and shortly thereafter, he states "To contemporary observers, laissez-faire policy seemed to be inadequate to cope with the problems of advanced industrial capitalism".  What Foley fails to mention here is that FDR had a horribly anti-free market policy during the depression, which many economists now believe exacerbated matters, ie, setting price floors, which helped small farms at the expense of consumers who could no longer afford to buy food.   To his credit, however, Foley does end his book with a good joke:  "On the whole, historically the best results seem to come from modest, and limited efforts to build institutions such as central banks, social security ...".  It seems as though the best compliment Foley can come up with for capitalist societies is Social Security, a system which, under current operation, is scheduled to be completely bankrupt in thirty or forty years. 
 These 2 guys playing Harry and Lloyd were so disastrous. They didn't even know how to act corny when they're supposed to.   Jim Carrey might be crazy at times but I don't think he's this bad. The whole thing looked like monkeys flying around the screen. Nevertheless, it has some funny moments like when Jessica's parents found all the poo sticking all over the toilet.  The whole idea of a 'special class' was just so stupid. Nothing made sense. I didn't see a single point of the whole plot in the first place just to get a little extra cash.  The first one was a lot better than this one. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were a lot dumber and a lot funnier. These 2 were worse than dumb and weren't even funny at all.  I guess 'Dumb and Dumberer' would be better if it were still Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels starring but nooo, it had to be these 2 who I don't even know.   Please don't watch it guys. It may be funny for some guys but it's mostly corny like kindergarteners gone wild. Watch the first one!!!  Kirstie Mabita 
 This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
 This book has no questions and answers for the FCC test.  It only answers the most basic of newbie questions, and certainly is NOT a "Reference for the Rest of Us" as many of the "Dummies" books can be. I would not recommend this book for anyone except the least literate and most technically-challenged among us...not exactly what Ham Radio really needs to have as members. I wish I hadn't bought it 
 I read it. I finished it. I put it down and didn't speak of it again. Not my style: Too much floof - not enough substance. However, if this is your thing, it's not poorly written 
 Do you know how clever Alan Trachtenberg is?  I mean, do you really, really know?! Because if not, this book is for you.  Trachtenberg's book is only superficially about Indians or Americans, it is about the obscure conections he can draw between unrelated things--because he is very clever, you know. In so far as this book has a thesis, that it is it 
 The Programs are good except the the first two DVDS in this series are not copied real good in that the sound track is off on the first part of these DVDs. The rest of the programs in this series are good 
 I find this book to be a big waste of money. I thought for $ 17.00 I would get some useful information, I found it to be lacking in anything useful or worthwhile. Do not waste your money on this one. If I could give it a zero rating that is what it would have 
 Very rarely does a film improve upon the source novel. I wrote a review of one, King's Ransom, which was made into a vastly superior film by Akira Kurosawa called High and Low. Goldfinger, the film, is one of the classic Bonds -- my favorite, to be sure. The novel, in contrast, is too long, is illogical in some parts, offensive in others and makes the reader realize what a superb job screenwriter Richard Maibaum did in adapting it for the film. These weaknesses stand out in particular:  First, the behavior of villain Auric Goldfinger is completely illogical during the torture scene. You might remember the terrific laser beam scene in the film where Goldfinger, played by Gert Frobe, threatens to slice James Bond, played by the great Sean Connery, in half. In the film, Bond gets out of the mess by bluffing, making Goldfinger believe that he knows all about Operation Grand Slam, Goldfinger's plan to blow up Fort Knox. Goldfinger reasons that he can keep the CIA and the British Secret Service at bay by keeping Bond alive and making them think that Bond is his guest, not his prisoner.  The novel, in contrast, has Goldfinger threaten Bond with a saw. Bond doesn't mention Operation Grand Slam and has been a constant thorn in Goldfinger's side. Goldfinger has Bond dead to rights and, unlike in the laser beam scene in the film, has no logical reason to spare his life. However, just before Bond is about to be sawed in half, Goldfinger inexplicably spares him and forces Bond to pose as his secretary. There's a running joke that Bond villains seal their own fate by devising elaborate ways to kill him that allow Bond to escape. However, Goldfinger's action in this scene in the novel completely defy logic and cripple the story's credibility. Bond novels are an escape from reality -- an adult comic book -- but this plot development makes absolutely no sense.  In the novel, Goldfinger's plan is to rob Fort Knox of its gold supply. Fleming, unlike Richard Maibaum, apparently never realized how logistically impossible this is. Connery rightfully points out in the film that to rob Fort Knox would require a whole fleet of trucks and several days to complete. Maibaum's plan, while still fantastic, makes more sense -- detonating a nuclear weapon in Fort Knox to irradiate the U.S. gold supply and drive the value of his own supply up ten times over.  In the novel, Pussy Galore begins as a hardened lesbian who has no interest in Bond whatsoever. Of course, by the end of the novel, Bond has "heterosexualized" and overwhelmed her with his masculine charms. It's a very 1950's view of homosexualtiy -- that is, that a homosexual could be "cured" of his/her sexual desires like it was a disease. The attitude seems very backward and ignorant by today's standards.  The film strongly suggests Pussy's lesbianism, but it also shows Pussy, played by Honor Blackman, flirting suggestively with Bond. Blackman's Pussy may have lesbian tendencies, but she clearly also has a strong attraction to the opposite sex. When she falls for Bond, it makes sense, unlike in the novel. Bond still converts her, but the conversion stressed is more along the lines of Pussy joining the good guys rather than going from staunch lesbianism to being a Bond girl.  The film has a lot of Asian villains. Harold Sakata is terrific as Goldfinger's superpowered Korean henchman Oddjob, Burt Kwouk (Kato in the Pink Panther films) is Mr. Ling, a Chinese nuclear scientist who supplies Goldfinger with the bomb and most of Goldfinger's henchmen are Korean. However, the film, for the most part, avoids extreme racial stereotyping. Many of the villains are Asian, but there's no suggestion that simply being Asian is a source of evil. Asians would later play a prominent heroic role in You Only Live Twice.  The novel, in contrast, is vicously racist in nature. The nadir of this being Bond's statement that Koreans "are lower than apes." It's hard to believe that even in the pre-civil rights era of the 1950's, this statement could slip by without triggering a major protest from an Asian rights group. Today, it seems so ugly and hateful that I immediately lost a lot of respect for Ian Fleming. This is his hero who believes these vile things, so clearly what Bond believes, Fleming believes -- there's no way to separate the two. One wonders which other racial groups Fleming was bigoted against. It's a disgraceful moment in the Bond saga and a shameful comment on Fleming's view of the world.  Novels like Casino Royale, From Russia With Love, Dr. No, On Her Majesty's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice are classics and rank among my favorite novels. Goldfinger, however, falls way short of that standard. When I finished Goldfinger, I was left wishing that I had not read it and instead had left my impression of the story to the vastly superior film. The novel not only disappointed me, it made me think much less of Ian Fleming as a person 
 This movie was a major disappointment.  The plot is awful.  The dialogue stinks.  The camera-work is amateurish, even by b-movie sleaze standards.  It's poorly lit.  The acting is terrible, and most of the actresses are in fact ugly slags.  There is a lot of nudity, but don't expect to be aroused by it.  The people who made this did not put much effort into it at all and it shows.  I guess they figured that nudity + perversion was a big enough selling point, and that they could lazily toss the rest of the movie together in a slapdash manner.  Unfortunately, this movie does not even excel on the nudity and perversion front, except for perhaps the odd fellow who has a thing for trannies.  In other words, this movie has no redeeming value, and even the onanist should look elsewhere.  For something in a similar vein and from the same era, but that is actually enjoyable, I'd recommend something from the Something Weird catalogue instead. 
 Hugh's book is a disappointment.  It seems like a rush job thrown together to peddle during the election.  Not much scholarship was done either.  For example, he asserts that when Gore tried to block overseas military ballots from being counted, not a single democrat raised their voice in opposition; he must not have done a lexis/nexis search because Gore supporter Zell Miller was very vocal in opposing the effort to block military votes.  Further, very little was done to cite specific situations of democrat party vote (...).  The way Hugh segments the parties into pyramids and his description of the interplay between segments was useful -- but did not merit a hardcover book purchase.  Various Bush speeches re: 9/11 have been attached at the back for reference (perhaps to boost the page count?).  I like Hugh and I love his radio show, but Hugh has a fairly cerebral audience, and this book was more appropriate for Sean Hannity groupies 
 Fact of the matter is, even Lovecraft didn't pull off a good story every time, so it's even harder for people who write their own Mythos stories to do a good job. All too often, Mythos imitators misuse the conventions of the genre, with the mysterious elements brought right into the open so the writer's hero can solve them with some half-baked solution. This is in contrast to HP Lovecraft's stories, which mostly ended with the protagonist getting eaten by something or shooting himself. This anthology does not add much to what could have been the richest horror genre of them all. Instead, it just piles on more so-so stories that aren't innovative or all that memorable. It's not that the stories are universally bad, they're just so much less than they could have been, given the material the authors had to work with 
 as a loan officer in training this book has been a great tool in my lerning ,it explain in detail and clear how to do your job step by step, and how to avoid mistakes,i am glad that i found this book and recommended to any one interested in lerning about the mortgage business 
 Simple-minded and thin.  I usually get a lot out of Idiot's Guides.   This one was fluff and filler 
 IMO,this book fell a bit weak on the action department..The first half of the book was painful to read..I kept wondering when the real exciting epic story would begin.. I've read many reviews and it seemed that the book would be such an awesome read..I guess I expected to much from it because the action was very lacking..The overall storyline is the only thing that kept me from putting it back on my bookshelf,that and I couldnt believe the book was this bad..I kept reading hoping for some excitement..I was finally rewarded when a dark knight of takhisis got introduced..It was cool to read about Lord Ariakan gathering his army preparing for the conquest of Ansalon and I am sorta looking forward to see what happens in the second book.. But the dwarves were dumb and boring,except for brief humorous scenes with Selquist.. And most of the draconians were dumb except for Kang and Slith..   I hope to god the next book isnt as bad as this one... There were some brief moments of hope in the novel that intrigued me to read the second book. 
 this movie pits the gathering of the kids to ressurect some person and then reck hell on the place. Kids start getting colds and sick all of a sudden and thats when doctor Naomi Watts come to the town and then things start happening. along the ride is the boring Karen Black who is so dumb and obnoxious in this movie your mind will emplode on impact. but it brightens up the place when you see Brent Jennings(Witness, Little Boy Blue, Tvs Buffy The Vampire Slayer) in the house. otherwise its a nonstop bore. try not to fall alseep like i did while watching it, well maybe because it was 4 int he morning, bu 
 I did not find ANYTHING new or interesting about leadership in Mr. Phillip's book. More or less a bunch of tired old cliche's in hardcover or softcover - your choice. Save your money, I wish I had 
 This book was nothing but painful to try and get through. Though I sometimes enjoy Jodi Picoult's writing, Picture Perfect was extremely far fetched and simply unbelievable.  I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes, shaking my head, thinking...come on, give me a break. I stopped the torture about 60% of the way through, giving up the hope that I had indeed wasted 10.46.   Pretentious, unbelievable, boring, pathetic story line...save yourself the money and the torture..pass this Jodi Picoult novel by 
 A monster book of 641 pages. Proof that Eco's editor was already dead, or the book killed him. It is filled with lots of esoteric knowledge and history. Be advised that the translator, William Weaver, does not translate the chapter headings, nor the majority of foreign dialogue. Is he assuming that we read French, or would want to? The inclusion of 8 drawings does not advance the story and you wonder why they were included. They are there possibly solely to annoy the reader. Eco makes the reader feel uneducated by using words and terms no one ever heard before, let alone want to use. And the story suddenly becomes the Italian version of John Knowles' "A Separate Peace." And with this transformation: The hunt for "The Plan" or the Templars' Secret," is just a red herring, the story is not about these long dead French knights. As Eco uses 1960-70's LSD induced stream of consciousness writing style for the last 60 pages, he leads his main character to the Zen-Tao-I Ching conclusion that watching his friend be murdered is all for the best. Perhaps Eco should take his own character's advice and "Ma gavte la nata," and take the cork out 
 What I really didn't like about this book is the constant rambling after starting the topic sentence in a paragraph.  Which never concluded any information on the topic.  Then instead of going over all the variations of an approach, he makes it quite clear that this should be the method for every bowler.  In my opinion bowling involves individuals, and on mans view will not work for every bowler.  It would be more helpful if he used his insight in bowling on how to work with the different variations that you can see in bowling 
 How can a loving (deity) parent kill his children indiscrimantely? Only if it's the work of human imagination. The only good thing about this translation is that it was'nt to difficult to read 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 I'm a huge fan of Lawrence Block as a novelist. Well, as a short story writer as well come to think of it, but I can't really say that he has a gift for writing about writing.  First of all, this isn't really a "book" per say. It's a collection of essays taken from various issues of WD (Writers Digest) and thrown into chronological order. Because of these much of the book feels lacks flow. The articles are all but three pages long and only cover the bare minimum requirements for talking about their topic.  Yes it is conversational and that's a plus, but there are plenty other books on writing which have a similar style and say MUCH MUCH more. The main problem with Blocks book is that he throws one useful tidbit out there and surrounds it with two and a half pages of fluff. For great books on writing - books that feel like the writer is speaking directly to you - pick up Stephen King's "On Writing" Anne Lamott's "Bird by Bird" or Noah Lukeman's wonderful but virtually unknown "The first five Pages: a writers guide to staying out of the rejection pile. These have been my favorites so far, and I've read quite a few. Let Block get back to the fiction, (I read Everybody Dies awhile ago and it was amazing.) He's great at storytelling, just not so great at teaching it, at least not in this too-brief format. 
 Normally I like the entire "female power" thing but frankly the "this is wrong" or "evil" part of that storyline is really old.  In an era where girls do try out for and get placed on "boys" teams, these issues seem outdated.  Likewise rules were recently changed in Indiana (not even slightly a liberal state) that says any pageant receiving state funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sex or gender.  I know, this book is from 1999, but we are living in a conservative backlash politically and this is still happening, changes are happening.  Overall I felt the book had a very negative view of the gender roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be different.  Even the disempowered girl who creates the initial problems with her "magic" is empowered through a pageant and her cooking.  How much more gender role enforcement can we have?  Really, with a strong female lead, shouldn't a Buffy universe story do better than this?  In general the feel of the relationships and lingo between the main characters was fine but not particularly outstanding 
 This sounds like a wonderful book, HOWEVER it would be nice if you also offered German, or English Translation 
 This book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste I trust, but I've got to say, I just don't understand its appeal.  It starts out as mildly intriguing, and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative, but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear, and the narrator of the middle section, salt-of-the-earth gardener Son, is not only too good to be true, he's also deathly boring--a dull-witted drone.  I've read Bel Canto and The Patron Saint of Liars only confirms my belief that Ann Patchett's novels are overrated.  
 The fact that this book has received nearly all five star ratings confirms my belief that the majority of modern-day Americans are practically illiterate.  There is nothing particularly profound in this book, and much that is mis-leading.  A couple of examples: an early Celtic Christian prayer is quoted, but omitting most of the prayer and its references to God and the angels, so that it appears that the prayer is pantheistic (which in its true form is not).  Also in the first chapter we are told that the Celts were "nature people".  Well, I suppose that you could say that most of the tribes in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America two thousand years ago were "nature people".  In other words, the enlightenment in this book has more to do with New-Age fancy and 19th century exoticism than historical reality.  If you want something legitimately mystical, and a thousand times more profound, try volume 1 of the Philokalia, or The Way of A Pilgrim.  Sorry if I sound arrogant; I'm not.  I just hate to see people get taken in by this stuff when there are truly great works languishing in obscurity because you might have to read a page three times a day for three days before you get it...but when you do get it, you KNOW you've got something.  Peace.  Out 
 Zone 5 is not cold climate gardening! Book is a waste for those who truly live in cold climates 
 My taste runs to P.D. James and Martha Grimes.  I picked this up hoping to find a new series.  It reads like a Harlequin romance with a body in it.  Everything aches - eyes ache, voices ache, the gaslights ache.  Hardened policemen speak in voices husky with emotion.  And everyone but the villain is so blindingly good hearted as to be disgusting.  Throughout the story the author keeps building up to a horrible impending disaster - something so much worse and more terrifying than a cave-in.  The disaster turns out, surprisingly enough, to be a cave-in.  Absolutely tedious. 
 I purchased this item and it did not work in two 2005 dvd players. It freezes everytime after the first category. It only worked on the computer. I emailed the company (MGA) and they knew about it. They told me, "yes", that this dvd does not work properly in some dvd players. Unfortunately, this information is only listed in the instruction manual. If you want to play this on your television, I would be very hesistant to purchase it. Maybe it will work in 2006 dvd players, but my two 2005 dvd players, it did not work properly. [... 
 This book is complete garbage. There is nothing in it that is factual. If you want to read tabloid material please go buy "National Enquirer" or something.. Don't give your hard earned money or attention to this guy. He never knew The Harrison's and the book is fabricated stories by zealous bad author. Please go buy George's book "I Me Mine" or The Beatles 'Anthology" book is want to learn the truth about the man 
 This book is an excellent guide to self discovery; A tool for attaining deeper knowledge of the self. Let's say, for instance that you thought the book was relevant and scholarly, well then it is fairly obvious that you need to go to college, or in some way educate yourself 
 I cannot review this item because a month later, I still have not received the first issue of my subscription. Sorry  Frank Caldero 
 I purchased Crazy Croc even after reading all the bad reviews, but my son really wanted it so I bought it for him for Christmas anyway.  It was the worst gift i've ever bought....please don't even waste your money....trust me, check the reviews first, now that's worth it... 
 More spiritual than I would want.  I am sensitive to spirituality in books since it is so dependant on the individual 
 If you're a big fan of the Frank Peretti novels such as "Piercing the Darkness", you might enjoy this story of evil, demons and semi-Biblical themes. As a Christian, I found the parallels to the Bible to be interesting, but not compelling. In fact, these parallels were the only thing that kept me reading. In creating this work of fiction, Meyers goes well beyond the biblical descriptions of events-and this is fine. The problem I found was that Meyer's writing style is a bit annoying. It seemed like everything was measured in yards-the truck was getting closer and closer, 20 yards, 17 yards, 13 yards, and so on. It just didn't ring true with me. Meyers is fond of telling us that tears "burn" the eyes of his characters. And there are elements of the plot that seem contrived to add to the story. Sarah, a research scientist at a parapsychology lab drives an old car with a bad carburator. A single woman with a high-paying job would fix it or replace the car; she wouldn't put her safety in jeopardy. But Sarah is "too into her work". Even after the bad guy attacks her and her car fails to start when she tries to run away, she still drives the thing. In fact, the very next day she's giving her boss a long ride out in the country in it-even though her boss has a fancy car back in the parking lot. Another nail in the coffin is that even though Sarah's attacker's identity is known nobody calls the police. This leaves him free to commit more crimes that add to the story. And it goes on.   I'm afraid that Christians desperate for this kind of literature will artificially inflate the popularity of this book. It's really not a high-quality work 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 This book on the black market makes a case for going back to views popular in the 1960s.  In the 1960s, the black market was populated with cold-war spies and gun running free-booters.  Since then, the popular press has painted the black market as a drug running paradise.  Naylor tries to convince us this image is a lie.  The real black market criminals are capitalist executives in the military-industrial complex.  Defined in this manner, 'Wages of Crime' becomes a traditional left wing vehicle for brow beating those unwilling to genuflect before Marxist-Leninist dogma.   This critique is not limited to attacks on the US political establishment.  At one point Naylor laments that Gorbachev's generation 'forgot its ideological roots'.  On another page, Naylor describes the proletarian interests in South East Asia.  The reader won't find the standard pulp crime stories here, which is a blessing.  Unfortunately, the book relies on rhetorical flourish rather than statistics. Thus, it simply substitutes one stereotype with a second.    The text was pulled from independent articles, so the flow is sometimes uneven.  For example, a chapter seeking to debunk the political might of heroin/cocaine dealers tries to convince the reader that drugs are of marginal economic importance.  He complains that the published estimates of drug dealer wealth are too high by perhaps a factor of 100.  In another chapter, rich drug dealers engage in crimes with military-industrial complex.  
 Ravitch's book and its quack version of public education and the progressive legacy can not be taken seriously as she is heavily invested in bashing public schooling through a number of right wing think tanks 
 Sweet Charity is a thinly veiled cover-up for the many middle and upper class people benefitting from the "hunger" scandal wherein billions of dollars that could and should be spent on poor people are  instead wasted on staff, buildings, refrigerators and trucks -- the whole  food bank and soup kitchen nine yards. When added to for-profit  agribusiness interests whose garbage is dumped into this system for tax  deductions and at taxpayers' expense, the "food"  element of the  larger poverty industry makes sense. This book won't tell you that the food  banks and soup kitchens often receive legal "kickbacks" via  tax-deducted charitable "grants" from the likes of Procter and  Gambol and other giant corporations. If you want the real scoop on another  of agribusiness' dirty secrets, read something else. If you don't mind  getting hoodwinked, go shopping 
 Plastic internal pump cracked within a week.  Soap leaks from top down sides in multiple streams.  Looks great if you don't use it and keep it away from water.  Better keep it empty too 
 Nothing personal, I'm sure Ethel's a wonderful lady... but i found this book to be patronising rubbish!  If you have a brain, don't insult yourself by buying this drivel! So save your cash & buy something else that may actually be helpful 
 I'm amazed at the good reviews for this book. The only reason I can give for that is that perhaps the good reviews are all from the publisher, author and their many aliases.    This book's spelling, grammar, and coding errors make it impossible to use. I'm surprised that the code included on a CD even compiles. I was so frustrated after the first two chapters that I wanted to animate the book, just so I could choke it to death.   Do yourself a favor, if you want to buy this book just slap yourself in the face and save $30 
 I thought this would be a book with some explaining text, but it wasnt. So if you wanna practise scales and dont need any explaining text or input, history, etc, this is the one. If youre looking for a book explaining scales and want some more info, history, ways to learn to remember scales and so on, look for something else 
   30 minutes into the movie, I was picking my toes and making shadow puppets; decided that was more interesting and turn movie off...nuff said! 
 An unreadable exposition of the unknowable, or at least the ineffable. When Aquinas awoke to the realization that all his work was as straw, he probably didn't imagine that Milbank and company would be trying to send us back into that scholastic sleep one day. A little apophatic humility wouldn't go amiss here 
 But yes, Brooks and Dunn are getting worse.  They lost me as a fan with Steers and Stripes and I haven't heard anything on this album to win me back 
 This short novel started off ok, but it was not long before my brain was awash in confusion. This is a highly abstract experimental novel that makes little if any sense. Without question the author has a wonderful vocabulary and on occasion really knows how to turn a phrase, but she doesn't seem to know how to put her natural talents to their best use. The reader never gets to know the characters (and quite frankly doesn't want to get to know them) because they are so flat--less than flat. Furthermore, the narrator does anything but narrate the story because he is always too busy calling attention to himself and the fact that he is narrating a story that no one gives a s**t about. There is no plot and the overall idea is as hopeless as they come--TRULY HOPELESS. I really wanted to like this work and I pushed on, almost against my will to finish, but all I was left with was a disappointment that bordered on downright despair. For such a slim book, this may have been one of the most cumbersome ordeals I have put myself through as of late. Simply put, there are millions of better things out there to read and I should probably note that this is the only book I have ever awarded a one star rating--this is because zero stars is not an option 
 Being somewhat of a computer geek myself I could relate to the characters dealing with all of the network stuff and obstacles they faced trying to break into the Banks systems.  This was actually pretty well done and did not require any leap of faith as they REALLY had to work hard to pull it off.  This part was well thought out and I enjoyed it.  The problem is with the family/hostage situation.  It just wasnt as suspenseful as it needed to be and there was no sense of panic. Maybe I was looking for a little more emotion or anguish from the family. They were just too matter of fact for me.  Plus, when Harrison Ford and his "buddy" were perusing through the bank it just seemed a little weak that security wasnt tighter at this time.  I mean... even being head of security you would expect any visitors he brings would have to be very well checked out seeing as they can do just about anything they want once in these rooms. I know its a movie and we always have to allow a little leeway with things...but this sort of killed it for me.  Overall, its not a bad film but it is certainly not must see material. Grab it for a rental at the MOST. However, you could skip it and your life would still be about the same. 
 Mr. Reichheld has impressive credentials and I respect his intentions, yet in this book he recommends using poorly-developed surveys to understand customer or employee loyalty.  That's extremely misleading!  That process and the results gained will only mislead management and will not truly indicate how loyal customers or employees really are.  The only true way to understand and manage customer or employee loyalty is to talk to them and let them express their own thoughts! Mr. Reichheld has missed the mark 
 I read the first two chapters, scanned the rest, and decided not to waste any more time; there are too many good books to read. The premise of the writer (de Becker) is that intuition is correct where rational thought fails. He tells the stories of the lady who was attacked in a dark parking lot, the lady whose boy died during an operation, and the one whose son was getting a lot of attention from a pervert. In every case the lady had reason to fear for her or her boy's safety before a bad thing happened. To de Becker, each tale is proof that intuition was right and reason went wrong. The author does not cite his sources, but makes it clear that he is the world's foremost consultant, and gets these stories from people who attend his lectures and TV appearances (on Oprah!). The book might be better if it was all stories, but it is padded out to 321 pages with a lot of hot air. It never happens that anyone is taken by surprise, or has an unfounded suspicion. Becker gives us a slanted, unbalanced view, in trying to ratify the bold claims on the book jacket (how to know if every person your child will ever meet is a threat). The evidence is cooked. The thesis must be rejected. I offer the alternate hypothesis that de Becker pads his pockets selling bogus books to gullible parents. 
 I never received this item.  I've never received a refund from Amazaon.  It's been weeks since I told them about a non-delivery. They've written to say they've had it returned, but I haven't received a refund.    Neal Kirb 
 Okay. The premise of this movie had wings. I mean here we have a crazed asylum patient trapped in a spooky hospital for eternity trying to get out.  Fun stuff..right. Not in the hands of this director. I mean, when the only good scare devices you can offer up are an exploding clown and a dog thats had it's day, your in trouble, Mr. Director. Okay..lets try to right some wrongs done by this movie.  Right- Scary Hospital  Wrong- Un Scary plot devices  Right- Dead people making twitching movements Wrong- Exploding Clowns and rushes of violent air ala Evil Dead-       but much worse  Right- My complete and utter hate for the jock in the movie Wrong- My complete and utter hate for all of the actors in this         movie- I mean, come on who in the hell was this Shaft         wannabe and why didn't that dead dog rip a whole in his         cranium before we had to sit through all of his inane        epileptic dialogue.  Right- Use of confined spaces, like an elevator to heighten the         spooky.  Wrong- Too much use of going up the elevator and down the           elevator. I mean if there is such a thing as elevator           sickness, I had it.  Right- The film makers hearts were in the right place with an         attempt to do something a little different.  Wrong- Hey Bubs, listen. This day and age of horror..a little        different is like shooting yourself in the foot.         We horror fans expect more now days..even from grade B        movies.  Wrong- This was obviously a lame attempt to run with the big          dogs aka: Session 9.  Right- Okay everybody makes a big deal about them creeping          past that ghost. They say.."Oh what an intelligent        thing  to do." What? How the helk is that intelligent?          That ghost could have ghost rabies or something!  Okay, I digress. See this film only if you would like to see a rubber clown explode and a dog with no skin. Other than that, don't say I didn't warn ya

 I first came across the subject of remote viewing one night as I was switching tv channels and found a show about "psychic spying".  Imagine my shock when they showed a picture of my own company, SRI International! I've always been interested in anything exploring psychic phenomena, but to learn that this type of research was started at my own company in the '80s was exciting stuff indeed.    The next day at work I learned there were still people here who remembered this program and the scientist who started it, Hal Putoff (not sure of last name spelling).  Some of my coworkers said at the time (of the project's heyday) they experimented with lots of employees, sometimes they'd put a bunch of regular folk in a giant room and give them coordinates to see if anyone could "view" them. Needless to say, scientists are a hard crowd and many found it amusing if not silly.  Physicists I know who worked with Dr. Putoff said the army eventually took over the project. This is told in the documentary I mentioned above. Dr. Putoff was also interviewed in the tv show and so were many others including some of the remote viewers.  So I was thrilled when this book, "Psychic Warrior" was published.  I had hoped it would have tons of more information about what the project was doing now. But then I read it, and was utterly disappointed.  Like "Linus" the reviewer above I think this book was poorly written and the author is completely full of himself.  His constant grandstanding and egomania makes this very hard to get though to the interesting parts about the actual remote viewing.    Also I wonder about how someone can work on a top secret project and then write a tell-all book about it.  Perhaps the author made a deal to embellish certain parts of his story so it wouldn't be taken too seriously.  Either way, if you think you can wade through all the boring garbage about his home life and how great he is, you might possiblly learn a little.  But I can't recommend this book as a tool to help you get there 
 More ignorant ramblings from someone who hasn't done any research, which is typical of the rabid Christian 
 I just took an intro to particle physics class as a fifth year undergraduate who has had all of the usual courses that one is supposed to have to be able to at least gain a glimpse into the world of particles.  This book by Perkins is one of the worst textbooks that I have ever had to use.  The examples were limited if any, and the problems seemed not to correlate with the content of the chapters at all.  The problems that I did work on I had to reference other texts just to get an idea of what he was talking about.  I have to say that Griffiths' (whose EM book was great and his quantum book not all that bad) was much more mathematical and clear, as well as Halzen and Martin.  I agree with the other comment.  Get another book before ever buying this book.  Plus my Professor was not too thrilled with it as well.  I ended up buying the Griffiths text in the end, which helped a lot 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 This CD in my estimation is less than one star. It is very ordinary - reminds me of an average church choir. Very plodding.  I bought it as a Christmas present for my wife. After listening to a few songs, she asked me if we could return it. Wish we could 
 I found this book disappointing. Photographs of some of the more common species that are available at local stores were not shown. If there was a photograph of a species somewhere in the book the description segment did not give a reference page for the photograph.  Knowing what rare fish look like is nice but not helpful for most novice collectors. In most pet stores these exotic fish are not available 
 Ms. Castillo's novel should have been incredibly interesting to me, since I am a Hispanic Literature buff and have always been quite interested in Chicano Literature, but I found this novel tedious and poorly constructed. The idea of reading the novel in different orders has been seen before, as is obvious to any who has read Hopscotch (Rayuela) by Julio Cortázar or "Pedro Páramo" by Juan Rulfo, and it was best left alone. Castillo's use of the technique doesn't even match up to the level of a "Choose Your Own Adventure", because the three different readings leave you feeling exactly the same way, BORED. She makes her novel rest completely on the lives of her characters, but then she doesn't really ever develop them enough for you to become interested. I never felt like I got to know them at all. I was a bit disappointed, but I suppose this book could have some attaction to Chicana women who can identify a bit more with the characters. Maybe being a Chicana woman would help a reader to fill in all the blanks and holes that Castillo leaves in her characterizations, but the rest of us are left with a lot of doubts in our minds 
 Lucio Fulci...while many may not be familiar with the name or his work, he has developed a dedicated and even hardcore audience, mostly due to the extremely graphic nature of the horror films he made from the late 70's into the 80's.  What some may not know are those films only made up part of his repertoire, as he also was involved in thrillers, musicals, comedies, westerns, and even a sword and sorcery picture, titled Conquest (1983).  This Italian/Spanish/Mexican production (it states this in the beginning during the credits, and, for some reason, it didn't inspire a sense confidence in this viewer), directed by Fulci, stars individuals I've never heard of, including a fairly well muscled Jorge Rivero (Rio Lobo), the very effeminate Andrea Occhipinti (Bolero), and the very naked Sabrina Siani (sounds like a western...The Muscled, the Effeminate, and the Naked).  So what is the film about?  I really wish I could say with a degree of certainty, but the plot, what there was, was pretty convoluted.  There's a young warrior named Ilias (Occhipinti) who, prior to leaving his village (I guess to go off to become more manly), is presented with a magical bow, one that shoots arrows made of pure light, that is once the user figure out how to activate that feature.  Until that happens, it can be used to shoot regular arrows.  Anyway, Ilias goes off, and meets up with a nomadic wanderer named Mace (Rivero), whose main choice of weapon is a very poorly made pair of nunchucks, or, two harden pieces of wood attached by a length of rope.  While they're running around bonding and stuff (ew), a local evil sorceress named Ocron (Siani), I thought it was Okra, as that what it kept sounding like throughout the film, learns of a man with a strange and powerful weapon (the bow...I find it difficult to believe few people in this world had not heard of a bow and arrow, probably one of the earliest forms of ranged weapons) and knows she must possess it for her own.  Also, she's been having dreams regarding her own demise at the hands of a faceless warrior, one who shoots her with an arrow.   In an effort to prevent these premonitions from becoming a reality, she sends her various minions to retrieve Ilias and his weapon, which leads up to a some what climatic final battle between good and evil...a common theme in the genre, a hero, or a group of heroes, suffers adversity to rid the land of a powerful enemy blah, blah, blah...  I've seen a lot of films, and I've seen a number of films within the sword and sorcery genre, and I have to say Conquest falls a bit short in comparison.  It does meet a number of requirements within the genre (heroes, magic, good, evil), but lacks in the execution.  First thing you'll notice is nearly the entire film is shot with a sense that someone smeared Vaseline on the camera lens, giving everything a hazy quality sure to induce headaches early on (the film runs 92 minutes).  Also, Fulci must own stock in a company that sells fog producing machines, as nearly every scene also was inundated with a heaping helping of smoke, further obscuring the viewer's ability to see what's going on...the acting isn't horrible, but the dialog is...an example...Ilias and Mace are trapped in a cave and Ilias spots a snake, to which Mace responds, "He's harmless if he doesn't bite you."  Well duh...if a ten-ton boulder was suspended over my head with a piece of twine, it would harmless unless the string broke...the characters themselves are goofy and lacking any sense of likeability.  An example of this is Mace and Ilias (our two heroes) are traveling together, and Mace is learning how to use the bow.  They come across a lowly, completely non-threatening hunter, carrying a dead animal, and Mace shoots and kills him and they take the dead animal so that they may eat it...how very heroic...oh yeah, Mace seems to have a psychic link with animals, and doesn't kill them, but has no problems killing others who've killed animals and taking their food to eat for himself.  Ocron (the evil sorceress) sports a metal, horned bikini bottom and no top, and spends a lot of time having intimate relations with snakes (ew) and eating the brains of her recently killed victims (you see, the head is the `temple of secrets' and it's also quite tasty, or so I've heard).  She commands odd group of henchmen, including wolfmen, regular men, and various animated zombie-like characters, all enabling her to lord over a relatively small group of savages.  Most all the women in the film are topless, which helps, but is entirely gratuitous, serving no real purpose other than to take your mind off the fact the film is so weak in general.  The directing ranges from passable to poor, including pointless POV shots, stupid slow motion that only serves to drag the run time out much further than needed, and ineptly choreographed fight scenes.  I found the mostly electronic musical score to be highly annoying, monotonous, and inappropriate.  Fans of Fulci's stylistic approach to visceral gore will enjoy the inclusion of a smattering of graphic scenes here (brains, puss leaking sores, gore spurting wounds), but it's nowhere near the levels in his horror films, so they may be ultimately dissatisfied.  People not familiar with his penchant for splattery will probably be put off and find it hard to watch.  Blue Underground presents an exceptional widescreen print transfer on this DVD, despite all the funky cinematography.  Special features include two theatrical trailers (U.S. and international), poster and still galleries with lots of good-looking pictures, and a fairly comprehensive and informative biography on Lucio Fulci.  All in all, unless you're a Fulci completist, you might want to skip Conquest, as its' appeal is extremely limited, in my opinion.  Cookieman108 
 This new monograph has been released to coincide with the Whitney's retrospective.  Both the long over due retrospective and the new monograph are lacking in quantity and depth needed in doing justice to  this  amazingly prolific and important artist.  Abrams' previous Neel  monograph  had many more images and excerpts of  important interviews with Neel   throughout the book (provided by the forsight of Patricia  Hills.)  The new  book, under the Whitney museums' auspice, includes interviews with some of  the sitters.  While these anecdotes are interesting it doesn't make up for  the total superiority of the 1983 monograph (reprinted in 1995.)  If you  can find a used version of the previous monograph, you would be wise to  aquire it.  I also recommend Pamela Allara's "Pictures of People,  Alice Neel's American Portrait Gallery"  which puts Neel's work in a  cultural context (from the depression through the feminist movement. 
 I've read all of the Witch World books, including Ciara's Song, and was looking forward to the finish of the story about Ciara's grandchildren.  What a disappointment!  The entire story is flat and uninteresting for the most part, and the few points that could have been fascinating were not well-developed, e.g. Aisling's relationship with Shastro, and the development of her romantic relationship with 'Rann.  Kirion is two-dimensional-totally evil without any qualities the reader might want to explore, and even though he is her brother, Aisling writes him off in the beginning of the story- there is never any real struggle with having to destroy a sibling.   There are also two or three almost inexplicable chapters in the middle of the book that really don't advance the plot at all- regarding the winter rescue mission at Aiskeep.  Quite a lot of time and elaborate writing was done to take us through that, but I kept asking myself- What in the world did that have to do with anything that happened before or after?  It was like reading: "What I did on my winter vacation".    Many of the difficulties that the main characters must surmount are treated too superficially, so one gets the feeling of having a 'taste' but not being satisfied by the full feast that Witch World should be.    
 I got 2 of these for my husband and son for their crossword madness...and they both thought this was just 'cheating' and refuse to use them!  Oh well 
 Albert Hourani's A History of the Arab Peoples is a widely regarded general history of the Arab world. This is too bad, since as history the book is of low quality, with significant problems of organization and, where relevant to Hourani's apparent biases, factual accuracy. It does have its redeeming elements, but on the whole is for a variety of reasons not a reliable source as a general history of the Arab world, especially for the beginner.  Being the author of a general history of the Arab world myself, before I explain why I evaluate the book negatively I would like to suggest some alternatives, lest I be accused of attacking a rival publication out of self-interest. Philip K. Hitti's The History of the Arabs is a very detailed history which runs from pre-Islamic times to the 19th century. Arthur Goldschmidt's Concise History of the Middle East covers Turkey, Iran and Israel as well as the Arab world and is well-organized for beginners. It was the first general history of the Middle East I read as an undergraduate. Bernard Lewis' The Middle East focuses more on concepts and the flow of history but is also appropriate for those without a strong background in the region.  This book was first published in 1991. This review is based on the 1992 paperback version by Warner Books.  The initial weakness of this book begins with the very first chapter; although containing 458 pages of main text, Hourani's history devotes a mere seven pages to the pre-Islamic period. This is pretty amazing, for anyone familiar with that period, since Arab history prior to Islam is roughly as long as Arab history after it. Exactly how far back Arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute, but certainly there were people one could call "Arabians" as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium BC, or 1,600 years prior to Muhammad. The evidence is sporadic for sure, and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times, but seven pages is pretty paltry.  One might suspect an Islamic bias here, but the problem continues in the key early periods of Islam. The life of Muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the Muslim world, spanning about a half century from Muhammad's first vision to the death of his son-in-law and successor Ali, get only 11 pages. The first Arab empire, the Umayyads (661-950), gets seven pages, and the Abbasid Empire (750-circa. 945), which is usually thought of as the "Golden Age of Islam," gets only six. This means 37 pages for the first 2,000 years of Arab history, including its framing epoch, and over 400 pages for the next 1,000. This would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion.  What makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization. The middle time period between the collapse of Abbasid authority - roughly AD 950 - and the ascendance of the Ottoman Empire over the Arab world in 1517 is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history. This is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states, there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of Sunni and Shia, Arab, Persian and Turkic ruling groups, not to mention the Latin states. Hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to 950 to a topical one. There are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods (the Umayyads and the Abbasids). There is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time. If you want to understand the relative historical roles of the Buyids, the Fatimids, the Zengids, the Ayyubids, the Mamluks and their contemporaries, read something else.  It is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength - its "social history," or its description of the development of the Arab world. In fact I cited Hourani on the social history sections of my own book. In this regard, Hourani really is better than the alternatives. Over 200 pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the Arab world came to be prior to the Ottomans. So for those who have already read a general history of the Middle East or the Arab world and want a more specialized knowledge, these chapters are quite useful.  I have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest. This book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of Arabs and Muslims, to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the Arab world which might be interpreted negatively. The word "jihad" doesn't even have an entry in the index, although it is used, or perhaps, misused. On page 247, Hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation "to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom's defense..." This gives a misimpression, because legally jihad has two military meanings - the defense of Muslim lands and the Muslim community's collective obligation to spread Islam through conquest. Although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application, its use is overwhelmingly in the military context, and while Muhammad's battles probably could be described as defensive, the vast majority of military actions between that time and the 19th century involved offensive operations (the Christian counter-offensives known as the Crusades being a major exception).  More broadly, the single most influential Islamist movement of the modern age, the Wahhabis, get only a few scattered mentions, and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by 1991 had been felt for some time. The primary non-Islamist ideological influence, Marxism, is discussed of course, but the influence of Nazism during the 1930s and 1940s is left out. Nazi Germany is mentioned once in passing, and in the same paragraph on page 331 Palestinian leader Amin Husseini is mentioned, but it isn't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of Nazis, that he moved to Germany during the Second World War and played an active role in the Holocaust, or that despite this he was made leader of the Palestinian cause by the nascent Arab League after the war.  Hourani's account of the 1967 is incredibly inaccurate, giving the impression that Egypt engaged in some bluster and then Israel started the war. He mentions Nasser's demand that the UN clear out of the Suez Canal zone, and includes the defense pact with Jordan, but omits a key fact - the mobilization of Egyptian forces in the Sinai. Once Egypt did this, Israel had no choice but to attack, because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization, while Egypt could. Hourani also doesn't mention the statements by Arab leaders to the effect that all Jews would be wiped out in the coming war.  On the whole, this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of Arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern. Otherwise, I do not recommend buying it 
 This book poses somewhat of a conundrum.  Is it an over-thought monologue on the author's own hair color, or an exceedingly dull scholarly treatise?  The answer: it is both!  It's a hodge-podge of historical references, anecdotes, and Patty Scialfa.  Never delving deep enough into the history, it manages to still lay on what it does say with an all-too heavy brush, dripping with overindulgent prose.    In the end, it is sound and fury signifying... the onset of sleep.  If you are in need of a never-ending supply of sleep medication, save yourself some money and buy this book.  If not, don't bother.  
 Hi,  I am highly regretting buying this mat.  It is too bulky to carry.  And it came on sale in Big 5 for half the price of Amazon 
 When the Zyliss arrived, I removed it from the shipping box.  I did not try to use the product until several weeks after receipt.    It has a slider button which does not slide.  Perhaps that is the problem.  I have not been able to chop anything with it.  If I am using it incorrectly, I am unable to figure it out.  Unfortunately, I discarded the shipping package which I recycled as usual.  If I can obtain packaging for this disappointing tool, I will return it post-haste to Amazon.  
 I've read most of DP's books; some I've loved & read over & over again; some were so boring that I just had to skip-through.... I'm sorry to say that I had to skip-through the first 2/3 of the first story in this book -- Wedding in White. It was not as sensual or gripping as some of her better works. Only the last 1/3 of the story was gripping, and I would give about 2.5 stars for this story....  What was worse was the second story in this book -- Circle of Gold. It just didn't make any kind of sense! There were just so many contradictions in this story that made me believe that DP must have written this one while she was dozing-off, and I can't believe that anyone who has the least bit of analytical mind would give this story more than a 1 star!  
 I've got to give credit to Lara Parker for her attempts to satisfy the DS fan's thirst for further adventures from the bewitched Collins clan. She writes in a florid and vivid style that leaves no stones unturned in her return to Collinwood.  Ultimately, however, this novel disappoints in a number of ways. She style of writing is so adjective-laden that it leaves nothing for readers to imagine themselves as they paint pictures in their mind of the characters and action. This book totally lacks the sense of dread and mystery that was prevalent in the seies and even her first novel, "Angelique's Descent".  It seems more like a textbook (she is now a teacher after all) trying to teach readers about two eras:  American circa the Salem Witch Trials and the hippie era of free love circa 1968-69. Barnabas's inordinate affection for David has an illicit undercurrent and the ridiculousness of him confronting and socializing with hippies is comical to say the least. Quentin Collins is now portrayed an adversary for Baranabas to fight and destroy, rather than the family friend and confidant he had developed into during the latter part of the series. Any attempt to portray Dr. Hoffman as "beautiiful" is also laughable and the "shock" ending is really nothing that true series fan would ever really want to see happen. This book seems to also be at conflict with the timeline and development of Angelique's character in "Angelique's Descent"...and since she wrote both books consistency shouldn't have been an issue. The flashbacks to 1692 are yawn-inspiring for the most part and while the "time-travel shtick" is briefy resurrected for Barnabas, it has no sense of the tension and wonder that was prevalent in the series' forays back into time. Disappointing and not worth trouble 
 Love is blind, so they say.  Love is also deaf, judging from the reviews I read before purchasing this record. His debut was a masterpiece, the best album I ever bought. I'll always buy his new album as I know how talented Gough is, the brilliance he's capable of displaying.  One Plus One Is One is a semi back to basics record, an attempt to return to the beauty and simplicity of Hour of the Bewilderbeast, while still retaining the production values of Fed the Fish.  Gough has always been a quirky and eccentric artist, but that used to lend to his genius. On this album I find it hard to listen to some of the tracks without cringing: Year of the Rat (chorus), Holy Grail (children's choir), The Blossoms (that bloody flute), and these are just off the top of my head. The thing is though, if you take away the more over the top aspects of this record, this could have been an excellent album.   Many of the tracks seem to have a formulaic passage of flute and piano together, meandering away, going nowhere in particular and not particularly pleasing on the ear.  It sounds uninspired, insincere, and all the more disappointing for the promise shown at some point on nearly every track. Unfortunately there's always something that spoils it. Some may find 1+1=1 cute and endearing but I find it contrived and kitsch.            Having said that, it's a vast improvement from the self abusing guitar solo's and over production of his previous effort.  But from such a talented artist, I expect more. And so should you. 
 Unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging Bear Spray, don't waste your time.  The stories are all re-hashed versions of nearly identical situations; Man goes into the wilderness-Man sees bear-Man uses UDAP Bear Spray on bear-bear retreats.  This book is one long advertisement for UDAP!!  My book was actually misprinted, missing 50 pages right in the middle.  Initially I wanted to return my book for a complete one but, after reading the rest of 223 pages, I didn't want to waste any more of my time with this ONE story 
 This video tape works, but it is basically a clip of people doing a different exercise each, all pasted together to make a full workout.  I still think the moves work, but I'd rather follow along with someone doing a full workout with me 
 I tried to like this product.  As previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations.  If you only need a 2D floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less.  The object libraries that come with the tool - furniture, fabrics, etc. - are really lame.  This limits it's value as an interior design tool.  I did not attempt to return it so I cannot comment on their return policy 
 I bought this book as part of a two book purchase for a reference for a home built speaker project. The info that's there seems valid but doesn't cover the title's impression. There is no real info on building speakers and the design data is a little hard to follow. There are much better resources on the web. The basic program just shows how dated the book is.  I am sorry that I spent money on this...publication 
 No Rocky Top?!?  Why bother??  That's like warm beer & cold pizza, close but not quite 
 Faure's treatment of various Buddhist approaches to sexuality (he often trails away from the particular subject of sexuality into Buddhist approaches to desire, which are often not the same thing) is often verbose, confusing, and, all in all, poorly stated 
 This writer made so many mistakes on when the comics were made, what years they were published, and almost does not acknowledge past creators at all except in brief not so well researched chapters.  This Freek writer out of the side show certainly promotes his own work, and seems to be a big supporter of the Dark Horse and Image Companies, which might explain his limited knowledge in so many areas, Maybe he should design video games and leave history of the comic book to real writers who bother researching the facts before putting them on paper 
 This was a much anticipated and very disappointing reading experience.  Ms. Forrest is an excellent writer, but this latest effort should not be listed as a lesbian novel, nor as a romance.  It reminds you of the 50's when a lesbian character is thrown in for attention.  If Daughters of an Amber Moon had been the first book, then Daughters of a Corral Dawn would never have had to be written as a sequel because no one would have cared about the other group of women.  This is mainstream writing making money posing as lesbian literature.  The fact that Ms. Forrest is a lesbian does not make her writing lesbian.  In the last few years, her books have become more and more mainstream sanitized.  Daughters of an Amber Moon proves once again that you cannot buy a book just by the author's name.  Characters are not well developed and no one the reader identifies with or gets close to emotionally.  Writing skill is good.  Subject and characterization is not.  I would not buy this book again, nor recommend it to my friends 
  With the exception of the first and last tracks ("Amazing Grace" and "How Great Thou Art"), I would have to say that the balance of the songs on this CD are limp and unenthusiastic....better to go right to iTunes or some other music download site and just get those two tracks!!    I think the CD was made with good intent, but unless you want something to fall asleep to, this album doesn't seem to reflect any of the joy or enthusiasm that I associate with Christian music or Christianity itself. Perhaps it was just that the songs were sung "quietly", but I did not find them to be infused with much in the way of "inspiration", and I got none from listening to them.......  Far better, I think, to go buy something like the soundtrack to the actual movie "Amazing Grace", which contains beautiful and atmospheric compositions, and which deserves to be nominated for an Academy award....  Another option would be to buy the soundrack to either of the "Sister Act" movies (in addition to my suggestion in the preceding paragraph), they are much more lively, joyful, celebratory and creative than this!  Any of those options will leave you more uplifted and inspired than this CD left me...I absolutely LOVED "Amazing Grace", and would strongly urge anyone looking for a GOOD movie to see the film that "inspired the music" on this CD.   Seeing the actual film will leave you feeling inspired and hopeful; that good men can still accomplish great things, no matter how many people are on the "other side" of what they are working against!!  [Hint: I understand that that WONDERFUL rendition of "Amazing Grace" with the bagpipes, drums and other instruments that plays at the end of the movie is available on iTunes as a "bonus track", and it is DEFINITELY NOT TO BE MISSED!!! 
 I am a graduate student at the University of Harford. I havejust finished Intro to Neurophysiology. The text, Fundamental Neuroscience was definately not "FUN". The text was hard to follow, too many  unnessary details, and figures that were to complicated to follow. Also,  there was no space in the margins to take notes, and the summaries were as  weak in descriptions as the chapters. I gave the text one star because  hopefully this summer I'll have a lot of bugs to kill, a 100 bucks for a  fly swatter is a bargin these days 
 most of these reviews look like they have been posted by employees of the production/sales company that released them. they read like the fake tesimonials in cheezy infomercials. seriously, would you buy "another great Firm video" as genuine feedback? please 
 Could music suck so bad? I would give it a 0 but then I couldnt write the review....   This music is all that is wrong with electronic music...  
 This book is salvagable in a 2nd edition.  Objectives and topics need to be consolidated and highlighted at the beginning of each chapter and not scattered throughout poorly reviewed tutorials.  Many tutorials need rework (significant rework) before they can pass muster.   I have five years professional experience in 3D production and three plus years with Maya.  I do not agree that this book succeeds in its mission, nor do I agree this book fails completely.  Rather, I will say the book needs professional review and until that happens it should not be defended as a worthwhile text.    I lent this book to a co-worker and he complained that he could not get through the tutorials in several chapters.  We sat down, discussed the authors' probable intent, and then went to the steps in the tutorials that my co-worker highlighted.  As we struggled with the tutorials it became clear to me that the authors were not connecting with their audience, that they had failed to preview their intentions in the tutorials, and that the tutiorals were significantly flawed.  I told him to forget it and to stick with the videos we have in-house.   Perhaps the print format is the problem, but if you are going to do a book, then do it right. Wait for the 2nd edition 
 I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague 
 First remember Hank Hanegraaf writes like his radio show, building himself up as the 'Bible Answer Man' while putting other views down. For a thin book, he spends a lot of time discounting and discrediting other well known authors in the spiritual warfare genre.    The book is based on Hank's theory that modern Christians don't proplerly use 'the full armor of God' in Ephesians 6:10-18.  When he finally gets to it, he does a good job explaining these verses in the context of basic discipleship habits that will protect us in the spiritual realm.   If you want an expensive commentary on 8 short verses as well as a lot of jabs other authors then buy this book used 
 Philip Roth is a taste I haven't acquired yet.  He is lauded by critics - including Harold Bloom, who just happens to be a friend of his - as perhaps the greatest living American writer.  Before this novel, I had only read Portnoy's Complaint, which I couldn't even finish; I found it hopelessly dated, pedantic, and repetitive.  I like Operation Shylock more than Portnoy's Complaint, I guess - although I can't say that I really ENJOYED either.  However, at least things happen in this novel.  The gimmick of the book is that it is a "confession" - a story of supposedly true events that happened to Philip Roth in 1988.  The story concerns the emergence of a "fake" Philip Roth who is traveling around Israel, promoting the cause of "Diasporism" - the relocation of Israel's Jews back to Europe.  The real Roth travels to Jerusalem to confront his impostor.    Having now read the book, it is difficult to tell whether or not the real Roth is for Diasporism.  There is a lot of anti-Zionist rhetoric in the book - much of which I found distasteful - but is that the "real" Roth or not?  Is he really anti-Zionist?  It's hard to say, because he frequently asserts how foolish Diasporism is: the European community would not welcome the Jews back with open arms.     Somewhere in one of Raymond Chandler's novels, Philip Marlowe mocks Hemmingway as a man who thinks saying the same thing over and over makes it profound.  Well, the same thing can be said of Philip Roth.  There are a lot of things about his style I don't like.  He is very pedantic: he always has an axe to grind, but instead, he grinds his readers into the ground.  He allows his characters to speak, sometimes for pages at a time, without so much as starting a new paragraph.  His most annoying trait however, is how in love with himself he is.  It's odd but true - if you keep saying how great you are, people will believe you.  Through his characters, he lavishes praise onto himself and his books.  Also, he's apparently catnip to the ladies.  Is this novel non-fiction?  Of course not.  Will I ever read another Philip Roth novel?  Probably - with so many critics telling me I'm wrong, I have to allow for that possibility.  I'm just not looking forward to the experience. 
 The book is not even statistical by scientific standarts. It is a vague collection of observations that tend to change every year. This book has lost more money than it has made for people. If you want to get serious about trading read Toby Crabel, read Linda Rashke. You don't like to pay money for their books? Don't expect a $30 book to tell you about making money. It takes thinking, hard labor and teachers like Toby Crabel 
 This poorly researched book of straight up fabrications and quotes taken out of context has one thing right, some radical 60's leftists are trying to take over America, namely David Horowitz (former left-wing radical and Black Panther) and his band of 'former' socialists turned neos.  David doesn't even write this dribble, he just puts his name on it and hits the television machine and air waves.  If you've heard David talk about his book then you've heard all the best parts.  Media Matters ripped this book apart for its butchering of quotes by the likes of George Soros to state an arguement that could not exist without pure editorial manipulation.  It's been over a month and David has promised a 'full-blown' rebuttal to Media Matters findings but so far he's been unable to stretch the truth any further.    Wake up sheeple, David and Poe are coming for your children 
 This reminds me of bleakness. Most of these songs scream out lament to me, and I can't handle too much of this despite the fact most of my reviews lately have been rather negative, and poor scathing words. However, these are also cobwebs that have clung to my head and my heart, and finally my soul. Like all songs can do to a person this reminded me of my first night in Florida where the neighbors didn't come out, and introduce themselves. It was cloudy, and overcast when we touched down in Orlando International Airport, and it was rather windy, cloudy, and began to rain as we moved into our first house down here. I feel that the beginning of this album was rather gloomy, but then "Change" was actually a good rocker, "You" was one of the first songs I heard on Florida radio stations down here, and the rest seems forgettable except for 2 others, and they were "Mother's Dream" which is almost as good a rocker as "Change", and the other was "Far Behind". This actually got airplay in the summer of 1994, and I had been down here for 10 months. I know by this time I had been through alot, and it was depressing to me as "Far Behind" is to me. I feel like it was a rude awakening for me as I had been through 3 car accidents, and a soul change as I knew I wasn't the same man I was when I moved down here. I was nervous moving down to Florida as it was a change for me, and I know that it was a stressful change as I had to become a caretaker to help my grandmother help my grandfather as he was bedridden most of the time. He would pass away 6 months later, and that took a big piece of my soul at the time, and then on Feb. 9, 1998 I heard it again, and this was almost 2 months after my grandmother passed away in Pennsylvainia....yes she moved back 2 years after my grandfather passed away, and she didn't enjoy life down here anymore. I feel as though in many ways since being exposed to both Florida, and this album I've done alot of dying inside too, and "Far Behind" is one of those songs that did it to me. I can't cope with it as it seems as though I woke up from a long sleep, and not know who I was when I woke up, and have a headache. This is just something I don't need in my life, and I want, and long so bad to get back to thinking more positive, to appreciate roses, the sunsets of Florida. Yes I have to get over that there's not going to be much of a social life for me down here, but I have to begin to live again to appreciate the small beauties in life. I feel that people may think that there's beauty in this album, but to me it's a false one. 
 While reading this book I found the details of some cases to be unbelievable.  Also, the "photographs" of the murderers and detectives all looked fuzzy and more like drawings.  I've read a lot of true crime and never heard of catching a murderer because he breathed his asthma medication on the murder victim's hair.  Or because they chemically deduced which cologne he wore. And who leaves their backdoor open when they know a violent Doberman Pinscher has been getting through their backyard fence? Sure, just let that dog on in. And whose place of employment has a record of all employee's blood "groups" (not their TYPES, just their GROUPS), when the employee doesn't even know HIMSELF what group he is?  Then I read the introduction, which I always skip, and found out this book is FICTION, not true crime as the cover announced and in which section it was in in the book store.  As FICTION, it's okay, (I prefer Agatha Christie), but I don't believe the forensic work in this book is even based on any fact. So read it for entertainment, but don't be so gullible as to believe any of it 
 Gates should have excluded the late Anatole Broyard from this book.  Broyard was certainly not a "black" man.  He looked white, identified as such, and his choice should be respected.  Broyard's memory  should not be subjected to "ethnic rape.&quot 
 ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.  I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.  but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.  take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better.  so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one 
 Admission to America's elite colleges is an increasingly trying affair. An academically strong, middle class high school senior with no particular claim on a space, "un-hooked" as it is known, is faced with increasingly long odds of acceptance. The "un-hooked" applicant is squeezed by a dynamic made from increasing applications as more high school seniors go on to college and the colleges' own efforts to expand the applicant pool through increasing financial aid as well as recruiting international students even as they hold the number of places in freshman classes unchanged.  In this environment it is hardly a challenge to find a really sharp kid who was not accepted and also to find some "hooked" applicant who seemed rather less than qualified who was accepted. Venting on this situation provides a good release.   Golden vents well, but is unfortunately short on substance. Lacking quantitative data, the scope and scale of the matter escape Golden.   More importantly, Golden does not attempt to address what seems to be the most pressing question: What do we expect of these elite institutions? Do we require that they be social engineers? If yes, to what degree? Failing  an attempt to answer this question "The Price of Admission" is reduced to a voice only of frustration and angst.  For a more thought provoking read, see Harry Lewis's "Excellence Without a Soul". Lewis is not specifically concerened with admissions, as GOlden is, but Lewis is very much interested in the question of what an education at one of these elite institutions should be. 
 Barber's trenchant jargon updates slogans for class-warfare and utopian proletarian dictatorships. The rhetoric relies on emotion to bridge logical leaps, hides a distain for cause and effect relationships and sidesteps questions about human nature.  Instead, Barber carelessly brews a mix of hip buzzwords and mass marketing clich. If you read this tome, be prepared for endless repetition of 'the capitalist is dangerous, but united the people cannot be defeated':  Repeat the following 5 or 10 times and you have the book in a nutshell: "Jihad pursues a bloody politics of identity, McWorld a bloodless economics of profit. Belonging by default to McWorld, everyone is a consumer; seeking a repository for identity everyone belongs to some tribe. But no one is a citizen. Without citizens, how can there be ..." {fill in the blank with any utopian quality: justice, happiness, equality, etc.}  The central problem for 21st century Marxists is updating the logic of class struggle.  In the first half of the 19th century Marx taught a strict evolutionary progression from noble-savage to slavery, from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalism.  Within a few years, Marx predicted, capitalism would collapse and the unavoidable socialist utopia would emerge.  Of course, the collapse didn't happen and Marxist have been rationalizing ever since.  Lenin had to add the Imperialist phase.  21st century Marxist need to show imperialism mutating into  global consumerism.   Towards this end, Barbour argues: 1. Capitalists have shed their 'nationalist' identity, finding it easier to enslave the proletariat via media manipulation. 2. Media manipulation (global consumerism) seeks to replace indigenous cultural identities with slavish loyalty to global products.   3. 'Wild Capitalism' promoting global products causes criminal damage to indigenous communities, and threatens environmental catastrophe.  4. Protecting these indigenous communities (victims) will require violence (socialist revolution).  Hidden beneath this victim-oppressor dualism lies the traditional Marxist faith in central planning or 'government by intellectuals.' Democracy can be dismissed because the 'means of communication' are held by the multinational capitalist elite.  And, Marxist don't need an elections, as intellectuals they already know what is best for everyone else. Thus, Barber spends the second half of the book describing the failures of democracy. Barber asserts that "the epoch on whose threshold we stand -- post communist, postindustrial, post national, yet sectarian, fearful, and bigoted -- is likely also to be terminally post democratic."   Time has not been kind to Barber. His 1995 predictions of post-democratic cultures has failed to materialize.  The 90s were not a decade of American decline.  Despite his attempts to be hip and techno-savvy, he entirely misses the dot com craze and  blogosphere. Further, failed to address the rise of Islamofascism.  He calls commercialism all sham, but relies entirely upon its rhetoric.  Consider the cover photo, why is the girl wearing so much makeup behind a chador?  How is she getting the Pepsi through the chador to here lips? The book has nothing to do with Islam, it is just a marketing sham about marketing shams.  In the end, it sell 'Barber, the hip international intellectual' and little else 
 This was not one of my favorite erotic reads. There are so many characters in this book and I don't think the author distinguishes them from each other as much as she should in the beginning. I kept having to flip back to figure out who was who. As far as erotica goes, it has a little bit of everything, but there are some very lengthy "dry-spots" between those juicy parts. I like books that I can't put down. It was easy to put this one down. But I did finish it! Without the surprise ending it would have been worse 
 This game has a good concept, nice graphics, and some definitely funny moments, but the gameplay is a total bore.   There are two main gameplay styles: "investigation" and "trial". Investigation is the worst; it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room, talking to everyone, and a ton of pointless reading, much like an old point-and-click adventure on PC.   The court sections are a little better, but not much. Once again, it's very linear; you don't have to use your brain much, just try all the options. And once again, there is a huge amount of reading. There is way too much dialogue packed into the game, and not near enough actual gameplay. And most of the talking is aimless, too; very little of it actually advances the plot.  Overall, this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters, and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this. I'm approaching my 40th birthday, and wanted to hear how others had dealt with this transition. In all fairness, Ms. Braun does interview many women on their transitions. However, the language is superificial, sometimes to the point of being annoyingly "cutesy". For example her term "Fertile Void" which is defined once, is used as a critical thread throughout the work, as though it's a sociological phenomena. If the book had been written about that term specifically, maybe things could have been interesting.  OK, there is a period of time where one doesn't know which path to take, but I hate labels, especially cute ones, especially when applied to grown-up women facing serious challenges. I need to lead myself into new terrain, and find my own voice, and I don't need cheerleading and labels. I found the "rah-rah" attitude really lame. Worse still, the term "F-You Fifties"...I'm sorry, but I got over that language a long, long time ago. I don't think it's amusing.  One of the "success stories" was from a woman who, when she lights up her joints (marijuana) today, has much more pleasant trips. Frankly I felt offended and patronized, and I am no prude...I grew up on Ms. magazine, I went to a Seven Sister school, and I'm from NYC.  I was truly expecting More, as in that wonderful magazine for which Ms. Braun works.. 
 The first third of the book has quite a bit of repetition.  Perhaps this was an attempt at establishing greater breadth but it just comes across as loosely structured prose.  Maybe the editor could have taken a cue from Cantor and deleted the middle third of the text in which the author gives a rather watered down version of the proof for incompleteness - thus  failing to live up to the book's subtitle. The final part deals with some of the personalities around Godel at the institute and - having finished with the more technical material - makes for an easier read 
 BLOOD MERIDIAN is a novella or long short story streched out to make a 335-page novel. There is basically little if any plot. While Cormac McCarthy can write poetically, writing poetically about nothing is still nothing. It's like a million times zero is still zero. Most of the book is just one murder, slaughter, killing, massacre, beating, stabbing, shooting, scalping after another. It is an unrelentingly dark and depressing view of a time and place in history (Mexico and the southwest in the 19th century) without any redeeming happiness or hope. You cannot read this book from end to end without becoming depressed yourself. While I admire Mr. McCarthy's writing (see my wildly favorable review of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), BLOOD MERIDIAN is not worth your time or the fourteen dollars the book costs. Don't contaminate your mind with this jumped-up short story 
 I really gave this album a chance.  There were even a couple of moments where I thought that a song had a particularly good (in a cheesy way) 80's arena rock riff.  But without fail, even the songs that start out "good", turn into generic forgettable 80's rock -- you know the type that littered the early 80's music scene and all sounded as if it was written by some studio executive and a computer.    I guess there is no accounting for taste, and everyone can have their opinions.  Unless you are REALLY into early 80's power ballads, however, don't even think about getting this album 
 I agree with the reviewer who found this macabre.  Normally I like Jan Brett's work a lot, but I don't think that death should be portrayed as cute and funny, nor do I think that young children should be given the impression that death is a temporary state 
 My cat loved to drink out of the tap. So we bought this pet fountain to keep it off the sink. it works and the cat loves it, but the thing started leaking the second or third day after we bought the product. we have changed the filters and re-assembled the product (in case we assembled it wrong) but it still leaks! It also leaks slowly and we have hardwood floors - so we did not see the leaking until the floor started to swell a little! this could be specific to the product that i bought, but i am seriously looking for an alternative. it's great and quiet if it works well! 
 I really didn't like this book to say the least.  I didn't like the way it was written.  I didn't like the story line at all.  None of it made much of any sense and much of it seemed to contradict some basic Jedi guidelines.  I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1.  I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe.  Just bad.  It does have a couple relevant story lines that you might want to know if you plan on or do read all the Star Wars books published. I would only read this if you are one of those people, otherwise I would definitely recommend skipping this one 
 An admiring though shallow and poorly written account of a unique American genius. Though salted with several good anecdotes, Gordon's book mostly relies on the research and interviews of others and ultimately does little to explain McKinley Morganfield's life and times. For a writer who presumes to account for the life of a musician, Gordon's descriptions of various Waters recordings are especially poor. Far far better is his video documentary of the same name. One suspects the book is the assembled notes of that project 
 I was not please with this book.  It's views and the things it tells you to do are too radical for the average person. The book has some good points to make about our environment and how it affects our well being. However,  if you follow everything in this book you will not be able to be a normal  person 
 This book is exactly the same as "Handbook of Technical Writing" by same authors. The only difference is in the cover picture and colors. I think it is not a cool thing to sell the same book with two names without mentioning it. So if you have that one, do not buy this one. They are exactly the same 
 I have a little trouble sometimes maintaining a conversation, and small talk really isn't my forte.  I don't ordinarily buy self-help books, but I read the reviews of this one and I thought I'd give it a try.  Well, the good news is that apparently I'm much more socially capable than I'd thought.  The bad news, for me, is that this book has little to offer to anyone capable of even the most banal responses in social situations.  Say, for example, that someone comes up to you at a party and happens to mention that they've just returned from France.  Would you (a) ask what airline they took and whether they enjoyed the flight, (b) ask what parts of France they'd visited, (c) offer observations based on your own experience in France, (d) ask the person how, as an American, he or she was received in France given the recent international tensions between the two countries, or (e) offer up any one of a thousand other innocuous responses?  According to Garner, you should ask the person "how did you manage to get hotel rooms over there?" or "in what way was the food there different from what we have here?"  Well, you can probably imagine how much further the conversation is fated to go once your interlocutor realizes that he/she is talking to a complete ditz: "Well, I called and made a reservation."  "It's, uh, French food."  I can see these suggestions being of some help if your only other alternative was to stammer out some unintelligible response, or to say, "Ooh la la," or some such thing.  Such examples are rife throughout the book, leading me to believe that it could only possibly help the most socially inept among us.  Honestly, I'm not trying to be mean-spirited, and I can see how this book _might_ help someone who simply cannot think of a single thing to say.  But even in that regard, Garner advances theories and then cuts them short without developing them.  About five times I turned the page, expecting to continue reading whatever mildly interesting thesis Garner had put forth, only to find that the chapter had ended!  The book is basically a powerpoint presentation for nerds.  You're better off just having a little confidence in your own abilities 
 I had an extremely difficult time reading DREAM STONE and almost didn't get through it.  You probably shouldn't try to read this book if you haven't already read THE CHALICE AND THE BLADE.  I had no idea what was  going on nine tenths of the time 
 Don't waste your money on this one.  It was recommended by "Rich Dad" advisors, but doesn't tell you how to get going.  And unless you live in or want to travel to one of the 29 "lien states" there's nothing in for you.  The other states are not mentioned 
 Awful. The keyboards don't release songs from their locks of excessive emphasis in obnoxious "JUMPDAFUP!!1" breakdowns and formulaic structures. Ok, it's more about attitude than anything. That would be fine, but I have a hard time relating to the emo...tional, straight-edge lyrics. Suffice to say it's an impossibility. Eh, yeah. This is a decent record within the confines of its bloated, suffocated genre, (Which still isn't even worth a listen) but far from the most important album of the year. - Thus says the Pellingto 
 Good points of the EL-300: Powerful sharp beam; LONG run per battery change; easy on-off quick-mount clamp for anti-theft; and, it's a superb FLASHLIGHT. I like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs, so I often borrow it from my bike. This light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes, if the beam hits direct from even, say 40 away. Cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people's eyes. In my estimate, it is mostly a terrific flashlight, and not a great bike-mounted headlight, at least as a stand-alone.  Trouble is, that sharp-focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials: lighting your path (you actually CAN with this focused power); or alerting others to your presence. That would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic, or a tad right or left, toward peripheral traffic, depending where you are, and how the road tracks, and where cars are coming from. It's a real attention-getter to oncoming drivers, which is great, if conditions are all just right: IF you focus the lamp near level, and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam.   However, traffic off to the side is another deal, since the headlight's peripheral light suffers by contrast. I nearly took a short trip to a long rest, as a result. Late on a quiet night, one flaky guy entering a major, broad secondary road I was traveling was coming fast up to his stop-sign, on a side street to my right, ahead of where I had just rounded a curve. He had a view accross broad lawns, on up the dark road behind me.  After slowing just a bit, he accelerated and ran his stop sign. I was right near his position on his side-street, "committed," pedaling about 15 - 17 MPH, about to cross his bow. He started his right turn, gunning it, merging with unseen ME. He was totally UNAWARE OF ME, and was clearly of this mindset:           "No double-CAR-headlights,           no CAR noise,           so no CAR,            so nuttin' coming,            so, good-to-go, so -- GUN IT!" ... all in the space of a couple seconds.  Moving fast, with the right-of-way, I had the EL-300 blazing away bright. Only, it was focused straight ahead of me, and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front. I was dependent on the EL-300, to send ahead to the likes of him, unavoidable announcing LIGHT. It's what I paid for (about $45.00 delivered). I also wore a white helmet, had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk, and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals. But I know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit, when not bathed by headlights, and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver's eyes. That's why I own a headlight. It's why now-enlightened NJ demands a bike headlight.  Of course, neither does a DRIVER have any merit, when s/he rewrites the stopsign law to read "No need to stop as long as I don't SEE ANYONE COMING." He nearly killed me, coming fast at me, broadside. He had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn, still accelerating, when he spotted me and panic-braked. We were at one point about 2 feet apart, thanks to his hard braking, and my veering left on the (luckily deserted) dark main road.   I was, for a fraction of a second, looking DOWN at his headlights and bumper almost below me. Could have reached over and touched his hood ornament. Incredible experience. It was my closest call ever, and scared the hell out of me. It must've scared the hell out of him, too. He registered his shock-and-awe with a reproaching after-fact horn blast, as he scrambled around and passed me, racing off before I could read his plate.  I guess it must've ticked him off, my scaring HIM with that close call. One little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile. Equally maddening for him, after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight, and the white helmet, and all the reflectors (THOSE alerted him, once I was his front-and-center target), he would had to then see that blazing headlight's pencil-beam in his rear-view mirror. Damn, nuttin' he could blame on this creep on the bike. :-[  The EL-300 simply failed me that time, as I see it, by focusing most of its light in a narrow, long-projecting beam. It was focused left of where he was looking, when I was very close to the side street he was traveling, ignoring his stop-sign. There should, from so much light energy, be some part diverted wider, closer to the bike, even if lower intensity.  In my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp: 1. The narrow focused beam, making you "live(??) with" the single direction in which you aim the beam. Its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light.  2. That is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on, both vertically and horizontally. The vertical part is the worse; the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight's balance-point, so it's a seesaw that's forward-heavy. Lift your bike front, tap it down lightly, and you've likely refocused the lamp lower, as you would not if the mounting were at the balance-point. Aim it temporarily right (and tight), and you are seemingly good to go ... but only as far as the first noticeable bump. It then drops a few degrees, and you keep correcting it vertically, to light EITHER your intended path, or the oncoming drivers' windshields. Your need is like being at the Oscars: you want to both see, and BE SEEN, only in this case to save your life.  I am chasing after another LED lamp now, which I understand to have a wider (along with brighter) beam. I have respect for Cateye in general. Their current website page of battery-op headlamps does not offer the EL-300. 
 I regret buying this gun. It broke within four days of buying it. We did just enough shooting to adjust the hop-up(for accuracy), and it fired great. It was really accurate. The gun was made of really cheap plastic, and the trigger stopped working. Right now, we're waiting for a RMA on it. I would recommend paying a little extra, to buy a more durable gun. I bought another gun that cost $55, and that one is made of much better plastic and feels much more durable 
 How many times can you wear out the same story line. Kahlan lost, Kahlan found, Kahlan lost again, Kahlan found again. Or Richard lost, Richard found, ohp...Richard lost again, Richard found again. Goodkind has run out of ideas. He should put the Sword of Truth series down and move on to something fresh. 
 This book is highly recommendable. It describes the state of affairs. It shows how difficult it is to test our unique human capacities and also the solution. A brilliant boo 
 This book is an inspiring read with lots of good examples. The main strengths of the book are its passion and  advocacy of integrity, values and taking people with you when you manage major change. Otherwise it is now very dated as a theory of leadership. It came out originally in the late 1980's when management was made the scapegoat for US industry's lack of success against the Japanese, hence management is never mentioned in the book. At that time, everyone was calling for leadership to replace management without asking whether management could be upgraded to be less controlling and stifling of initiative. Ever since then, management has been consigned to the bad guy role - Theory X, transactional and initiating structure while leadership got all the good guy work - being Theory Y, transformational and showing consideration for people. The result is a bloated, unfocused concept of leadership with the leader as hero who has to do everything. Their top-down conception of leadership is also old fashioned as it makes no allowance for bottom-up leadership which, because it is limited to challenging the status quo, has nothing to do with managing people. We really need a reinvented concept of management that allows it to be facilitative, supportive and inspiring too as it is in sports for example, but that's another story. The fact that this book is still so popular is revealing because it shows we have not moved on in leadership theory over the past 25 years 
 I was very disappointed with A Guide to Elegance.  The information in the book is very dated and is not applicable to the fashion trends of today.  The fact that the book had not been updated from the 1960s was not apparent from the description.  I didn't find this book helpful at all and would not recommend it 
 While the first edition was the seminal standard, I don't see how the second edition can be considered the same.  First of all just look at the back cover, that's glaring.  The numeraters and denomenaters in the differential expressions are reversed from what they should be.   Such things make me hesitant to trust any of the rest of this text.  If nothing else 40 years is too long for a single edition to be used.  McCabe & Smith is about to come out with their 7th edition in since about the same time as the 1st of this one 
 Most of the frugal tips in this book are really quite obvious to anyone with any financial sense.  There is nothing new or revolutionary about what the author is saying and most of her suggestions fall into the basic financial planning category.  She also repeats herself constantly.  The book could have been about half as long if she didn't rehash the same points over and over.  This is not a good book if you are serious about finding ways to save money.  The religious overtones throughout the book are a bit offensive, as well. 
 I'm a John Case fan and this one was a real disappointment. I liked the Genesis Code so much I read it twice, and the others were very readable too, but this one just became way too unbelievable to be enjoyed. The story was contrived and the main character a little too stupid. Sorry - this one made me think twice about running out to get the next one 
 As a dissertation this book works well: it contains high level coverage of the theories associated with computer use, and web use in particular, especially descriptions of academic research in that area.  Unfortunately it doesn't provide the grounded, current, specific information and examples that would help a commercial practitioner improve web products under developmen 
 I wonder if they'll have the guts to print this...  I ordered this book April 30th, and it is now almost June.  They keep pushing back the estimated delivery date - which is now June 18th, SIX WEEKS after I purchased the book.  And I purchased it from Amazon - not one of their vendors.  I wouldn't be so upset if they simply sent me an explanation for the delay.    Ever wonder why there is no way of contacting Amazon.com?  There's no phone number, no address, and no email.  It's because they don't want to hear from you.  Once they get your money, you're on your own.  Edit: Ok, so I thought I had found a back door way to send Amazon an email.  Under review guidelines (under FINE PRINT when you are writing a review) there is a button for "contact us."  This must be an attempt to keep people from writing reviews full of Amazon hate.  But after writing a lengthy yet respectful email to Amazon, it simply bounced back "sorry there was a problem with your order - please try again later."  Oh well, I should have known it was too good to be true.  I'm sure they'll be in a big hurry to get that one fixed.  If the BOOK ever shows up, maybe I'll get a chance to review IT.  Or maybe I should just go support my local bookstore instead of another Home Depot/McDonalds/Starbucks/Wal-Mart 
 I bought a couple of Bob vidoes through Amazon for my son, age nearly 2, who loves the series. We were crushingly disappointed by these videos, though. The wonderful voices of the UK version (Neil Morissey et. al) have been replaced by American voices. WHY do they do that? For us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ain't Bob. British shoppers and anyone familiar with the original Bob should be warned. (Can I get my money back? 
 The tracks on this album are later recordings of Bob Wills from 1965 until his death. They are, by and large, not recorded with the Playboys (though one or two show up on a few tracks). Instead of the 30's/40's West Texas  sound I love, these recordings have something of a Vegas/Sinatra 60's feel  to them, especially in the backing. I'd recommend The Essential Bob Wills  or The Anthology instead 
 I can only say, not being a classicist, but one who did study under the esteemed Prof. Edward O'Neil of Univ. of Southern California, that I find it curious that this author does not deal much with the theories of migrations (Achaeans, Dorians later) into Greece that explain origins and approximate dates of certain myths. For example the inclusion of chthonic deities/mother earth  deities being early myths of Minoan influences, the patriarchal - sky-god myths relating to Achaeans and their influence by migration on the Greek mainland. I find H.J. Rose better at this for sure, as is O'Neil's work on Library of Apollodorus. Man, Myth and Monument,is also an excellent guide for anyone who wants to follow this fascinating aspect of myth 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 I had to return this bible because the print was way too small 
 Danielewski is a little like "musician" Puff Daddy: he really does very little work on his own but is an expert at appropriating ideas from the avant-garde and then rearranging them in a comfortable, easily consumable form. "House of Leaves" has more in common with Stephen King than it does with Ballard, Burroughs, Poe, or even more radical artists who use the methods MD steals, like Samuel R. Delaney.  If having to turn a book while you read seems "cutting edge" or "daring" to you, then jump in. Otherwise, you should go buy some Jeff Vandermeer of China Mieville -- two artists less concerned with empty stylistic tricks and more focused on producing quality literature 
 I didn't watch Millenium when it was on ten years ago, so I thought I'd give it a try on DVD, as I'm a big X-files fan. I watched two shows: "The Beginning and the End" and "The Dogs". They were ridiculous AND boring. I'm done with Millenium 
 In 2001 during the (good ridance)time of your life craze they released a Cd to make every song accustic to like time of your life. 
 Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film 
 I cannot copy anything onto the PVDs. My BURNER is good, as some have suggested other peoples burners were bad because this did not work...umm yeah I think you are LUCKY if it does.. it wouldnt let me copy valid format pictures, and when it goes to "burn" the music files the time clicks on the counter with no progress whatsoever..This product is junk 
 There is no scholarship in the book, a few reference that are minimally supportive to his cause. The premise of the book is that Agriculture hijacked civilization 10,000 years ago.  Hijacked!!! How do you prove that one?  He believes ALL agriculture is detrimental, including organic.  He asks us to go back to hunting and gathering in the form of "perenial polyculture" and describes the satisfaction of a Buffalo hunt in a farmers field. He believes (no proof at all) that hunter gatherers had sensory abilities that make us moderns practically robotic. Are we victims of agriculture? - there is a real arrogance here for the reader, who apparently is too ignorant to see what has happened. This author has not got a clue what it meant to be a hunter gatherer, and there is little description of their lifestyle other than how the author feels when he goes out hunting.This is real belief in and grief for the loss of the garden of eden. It is written like a expose, a conspiracy of the elite( probably started by a female), who just wanted to keep slaves and accumulate wealth.  This is a real disservice to people trying to improve/reform and innovate in agriculture. It should have no stars at all(that option did not seem to be available) and I would not have read it, if it had not been choosen by my bookclub 
 The book sucks, 90 out of a 100 patterns are HIDEOUS, most of them really basic and boaring too. Image files aren't even in layers for editing in photoshop, as advertised. A complete waste of money. 
 This book is should be about Aztecs and Cortes. Thats a cultural war.. 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this book after following the Worthington case...I had no idea that it would be a self serving forum for Ms. Flook to write about things that "might" have happened to Christa or tale after tale of the flirtation she had with DA Michael O'Keefe. Any facts that were actually presented here could've been obtained by watching Court TV or reading a newspaper.  I truly hope that someone will write a better account of this story, possibly someone who PERSONALLY KNEW Christa and maybe gave a damn about her?  It took me quite a long time to muddle through the book...I kept hoping SOMEHOW it would get to the reality of the case, but I was bitterly let down.  Oh, and the one star? Far too generous 
 Junk.  You will get a lens cap error in about a year or so, where it will tell you lens cap is on and you will not be able to record anymore 
 I picked up this book because I'm always looking for mysteries with an antiques theme. I have been an antiques dealer for many years and also have written a newspaper column on antiques and published newsletters on children's illustrators. I say this because I don't want anyone to think I'm naive in the practices of paper dealers. This doesn't mean I approve of them. The author doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with ripping a cover off and an illustration out of a $10 magazine and then charging $40 each for them, pitching the rest. She doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with ripping apart a book, as long as it's "imperfect," so she can make a BIG profit on the illustrations. She isn't selling prints, artwork created to be framed and displayed. She's destroying publications that other collectors would love to own intact, even if imperfect. Old magazines and books are not a renewable resource for the collector or researcher, and fewer and fewer survive each year because of dealers like her. I know this criticism has nothing to do with her writing, but I will not read a book that promotes such practices and leads the reader to believe it's acceptable. 
 This book is not for those who want to either learn mathematica graphics or extend their knowledge, as in my case. It is not clear who the audience is for this book. The book starts with graphics primatives (points, lines, polygons, etc), by page 10 your building 2D plots of rotated Cantor sets that have little to do with the topic at hand. By page 49, examples of inverted Farey fractions illustrate something having to do with Graphics, but what it is has already been lost. It only gets worse, roughly each page has a dense set of mathematica code for generating esoteric graphics. And their is about one to two sentences to describe this code. You are left on your own to unravel it. As and intermediate user of Mathematica and one whose been using it since version 1.0. I find the coding hard to understand. (Remember there is no explation) Thus, this book is not for beginners and folks like me. Its target is for those who work at Wolfram Research, such as the author, and play with Mathemeatica all day. In this case, they already understand the material. This book is a disaster 
 This toy is poorly made. I got one for a 18-month-old. It lasted only one day. When the child dropped the toy on the hard wood floor, the wire broke off from the wooden base and the base was chipped.  This toy is smaller than expected. 
 This book is analagous to buying a new elliptical, anxiously opening the user manual to find out how this new piece of equipment is going to benefit you,  only to find page after page outlining the technical details of the inner workings of the machine with the last sentence or so briefly mentioning the effects the machine can have on your life. The author is obviously an expert on the subject of astronomy and how it relates to ancient historical monuments, but he is so caught up in the technical details that "the transformation of our consciousness" is brushed aside as an afterthought. Instead, the author drones on and on and on about monuments, angles, precessions, measurements etc. It's obviously necessary to briefly cover the technical aspects to build a foundation for the more exciting stuff to come, but this book never builds on that foundation. There were brief moments when I thought the book started to get really interesting, but the author would quickly revert back to the same old empirical, newtonian shallowness with more chapters that should have been titled, "who gives a [...]." John Major Jenkins is not really interested in the metaphysical side of this subject, and if you don't believe me, I quote page 239 of this book..."as a reminder, my work is not really to identify a mechanism that could empirically explain why a solstice-galaxy alignment might have transformative effects for life on Earth." My question is then why mention the transformation of consciousness in the title when it's hardly mentioned in the book? You would think that the benfits and effects of the sun aligning with the galactic center is going to have on our consciousness would be the main focus, since after all, it's what most of us should be most concerned with. If you are preparing for a test in astronomy, this book is for you. 2 stars for the misleading title. 
 According to the authors, the main idea behind achieving "full engagement" is to maximize your physical and mental recovery.  The only thing this book provides are obvious suggestions for doing so. ("get enough sleep and exercise", Duh!)  It is basically a book of case studies on how various professionals have implemented the "program".  Don't waste your time or money; skim through it at the bookstore and do some internet research and you, too, can become "fully engaged" 
 Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner's book on the art of changing minds and affecting opinions has an appealing pull. Written by a qualified professional in the field, the book is another output of the impressive Harvard Business School Press. The book advances the view that there are seven, what it calls, "layers" or "levers" that affect a change of opinion. These factors, whose titles all begin with `re' are: -Reason -Research -Resonance -Resistances -Real World Events -Resources And Rewards and -Representational Redescriptions   Gardner subsequently proceeds to elaborate on each of the factors within contexts such as an institution, among a population, up close or as relate's to one's own mind.   So far, so good, many would say; alas the reader is compelled to add `so what?' to the phrase. Changing Minds is indeed the work of a qualified professional, but the reader is neither provided evidence nor shown the techniques and history behind the author's conclusions. Furthermore, being the work of a researcher in an academic setting, readers should not expect practical instructions or employable techniques. Rather, Changing Minds concentrates on the mechanics and psychological hypothesis. In this manner, the book is very much a scholastic paper. Finally, there is scant evidence that the author employs his own teachings. Little proof, research or reason is offered here to be convincing or allay any of the readers' resistances. Similarly dismissed is the need for charts, sub-titles, illustrations, indented or highlighted points or synopses.   Furthermore, and more ominously, the author makes several practical mistakes in the way he reads or interprets the world rendering some of his data and experiences suspect. He claims that schools are agents of change and serve to instill different opinions in youngsters. Those are his opinions and not supported by any empirical data. He does not provide any supporting data either. In fact, the contrary is true. Schools are designed to breed uniformity and teach adherence, obedience and group activity. Barely a student will pass physics class were he to challenge a prevalent theory. A law student will probably find himself choosing a new major should he differ with prescribed laws. Similarly, imagine a student disagreeing with the outcome of World War II, an astrology student disputing the form of nova stars or, at an elementary level, a high school student butting heads with his classmates and instructors. Another error is the assumption that events have lead to fundamental change even in thought process of political leaders. Let me quote from the book. While Gardner cites the example of George W Bush following September 11, 2001, many scholars and historians have shown that far from changing his mind, the US president instead leveraged the event to more resolutely drive his pre-existing agenda. Much of what transpired following the events of the day were the accelerations of the American president and his officials' overt and covert ideas and strategies. Gardner terms the new Bush, a "multilateralist"! Uncomfortably, 132 sovereign countries and a lack of support from the United Nations would disagree. Moreover, despite such fierce opposition, Bush proceeded with his plans nonetheless. Further down the pages, the author condemns Stalin's pact with Hitler as "cronyism." He conveniently forgets or omits the allies' earlier pact with Hitler or the West's subsequent treaty with the "extremely paranoid" Stalin. In short, being a tenured academic Gardner himself seems most susceptible to institutional tunnel vision and in need of constructive cognitive dissonance.   Lacking the appeal of practicality, the burden of proof or applicable relevance set in actual events Changing Minds: The Art And Science Of Changing Our Own And Other People's Minds is solely of interest to researchers in need of alternate sources on the topic.  Gardner does not provide any empirical basis for his opinions, which also deviate from the title and stated scope of the book 
 I got burned when I bought this bomb, but my motives weren't entirely pure, so I have to take the heat for it.  This movie, while not the worst I have seen, is certainly among them - not even Janet Munro as the star could save it.  The effects are purely photographic, the topic is moronic and unbelievable (even if you WANT to believe it, you can't); there's just nothing good to be said about this film except, in my purchasing a copy, there is one less in circulation 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 I can't believe my sister owns this book.  No wonder her life is such a wreck.  What can you expect when you try to meet men by getting plastic surgery, never returning their calls, use sex as a weapon of control, and so forth.  Read GOD IS A WOMAN: DATING DISASTERS for real good advice and to really undestand how guys think.  Also, A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR THE BOYFRIEND is good but that's more for when you are in a relationship.  
   Well, I don't if I would trust anything written by this author. He was recently arrested after admitting to sexually molesting some of the young boys who were his patients.    Here is a quote from NBC5 television, "CHICAGO -- A psychiatrist in the north suburb of Long Grove, Ill., was arrested this week for the sexual assault of two boys. The suspect, Gary Almy, 61, touts himself as a "biblical councilor." Police said Almy admitted that he fondled two boys at a residential teen treatment center. Almy, who once headed a veteran's hospital, is being held in a Lake County jail on $600,000 bond" 
 This book was suspenseful at first, but soon became a "video game". Every corner turned was a new problem or a "monster". The book soon devolved into a trip down Christian Land. In the end, I feel like I was beat over the head with a Watch Tower 
 This book's purpose is to argue that Wal-mart is an evil empire.  Fishman throws in some positive facts to try and seem neutral, but throughout the book he shows his socialist stripes and lack of understanding of basic economic principals.  The sections of the book that I most enjoyed and found most interesting were the great in-depth anecdotes about companies that have a relationship with Wal-Mart.  I had trouble finishing this book because his diatribe against Wal-Mart becomes more intense near the end, but at the same time his arguments have so many gaping holes.  Those who understand basic economic principles will shake their head in disagreement many times as they turn the pages of this book.  Overall, I feel quite dismayed because I think he will be successful in convincing many uninformed readers that Wal-Mart's impact is more harmful than beneficial. 
 When you make claims like that you'd better be able to back them up. Ms. Green does not. I live in Portland, Oregon, a fairly cosmopolitan city but no New York, Paris or Singapore. We have little Russian specialty stores and big pan-Asian supermarkets such as Uwajimaya and Fubon. Off the top of my head I can name a couple dozen vegetables which are perennially on the shelves at these two places from shen choy and bitter melon to gingko seeds, padan and pea sprouts. These are all commonplace in East Asian cooking. None even gets a mention.  It's good as far as it goes, so it doesn't get one star. It doesn't even come close to its brag, so it gets no more than two 
 After watching the newest version on television, this one didn't measure up. The movie didn't make you want to watch more. There was no romance compared to the latest version 
 Lent to me 'cause I'm such a mystery fan.  But I couldn't get over the fact that Anne Perry is herself a convicted murderer and if I bought her books I'd be contributing to her profit off her murder.    From Time: "When mystery writer Anne Perry was 15, she committed murder. She and her friend, Pauline, killed Pauline's mother. Perry served 5 1/2 years in an adult women's prison. After her release, she left New Zealand and has never returned. Now living in Scotland, Perry has fashioned a new life and a successful career. Although family and close friends knew about Perry's past, it was never known to the general public, including her agent and her U.S. publisher. The New Zealand film, Heavenly Creatures, deals with the 1954 case. A New Zealand reporter uncovered Perry's previous identity as Juliet Hulme. Perry insists she does not remember specifics of the actual crime."  Watch the documentary "Heavenly Creatures" for the facts.  It's just gross that she got off so light for murder and is now rich because she writes about how to committ murders.  She's not wise, she's opportunistic 
 Pros: Instead of having numerous stradegy guides (as Prima has released one for each individual DAOC update)...this Epic book will allow you to have it all in one spot.  Book contains many MANY charts filled with plenty of infomation to keep number crunchers happy.  Book also contains lots of lists and explinations of Epics and Chamption Quests and Trials and what you get from them. Also mentions in detail about Artifacts.  Cons: The book is really not complete. Off the top of my head... I see nothing mentioned about kill tasks or trophy hunting. Prima got chart happy, but they forgot about a few charts that would have been incredibly useful. So I'm still stuck jumping back and forth between the game and some web sites out there that DO have such charts. Oh well.  If your a beginner, this book doesn't give you a lot of nity grity BASICS. Like....ooooh, I dunno...how to use the quick bars and how to change your chat menus and what all of the buttons do on your in-game windows. This may sound nity-picky, but if a beginner buys this book expecting it to tell them everything they need to know.... they will be soarly diappointed.  I've found errors. I'm somewhat new to DAoC, incomparion to those players that have been with the game for years.... and even I found errors in some of the character builds they put in here. They try to give you a general run down of how you should build your toon (how many points to train up into your specs), but reading some online message boards on the game would probably give you a more accurate starting point. Example at hand: i don't know anyone who would put less than 50 into the flex spec of a heretic. This book tells you to go with 25... and doesn't even give you an example build of someone who went with crush instead! (major DAoC players will be laughing right now...trust me.)  This book completely lacks a guide to crafting. It mentions what each race can choose as their craft...but thats about it.  Nothing really mentioned about housing.  Maps are kind of scattered about the book. Some are very vague and general pictures of areas.  Newspaper-type quality paper used.  No extra pages in back to write your own notes.  Slash command lists are useful.... but INCOMPLETE.  Really does not give you an overview of what each toon-types roll in the game or in a group is. Previous prima guides I have bought for RPG games have done a much better job.  QUESTION TO PRIMA: You just released 3-hole binder edition books for COH AND COV (city of heroes/villians)....this inables you to update the books easily by releasing addition pages to fit in the binder as opposed to creating entirely new books. For forever-updating online RPG games this has been your best idea yet. Absolutley great idea... BUT....why on earth wouldn't you do that for DAoC as well?!!?? DAoC is a content-heavy online RPG game, as well. Many of the above problems are things that were probably just overlooked or forgotten. They could have been fixed with re-released of pages or additional sections. But now, you cannot do that since this books is a bound edition.  Disappointed. Very disappointed 
 "War Goddess" is a good movie, but have many different versions. In the Spanish version not have nudes but something scenes not see in the Italian or American version with nudes. In this copy your quality is very bad, Your image have many lines and have cut one scene, the wrestling enter two amazons nudes.  This ending with the Sabine Sun victory and this kisses your sister and rival.  In Italian version is suggested the homosexuality enter the Greeks, in this version is cut also. The encounter enter Greeks and Amazons have more things in the Italian version. One change of couples very particular: boy with boy, girl with girl. Is very pity this version.  
 Too much time invested in a story far too long with little to say in a convoluted but simplistic plot. It was a labor to finish and very unsatisfying. Very little substance to Mr. Dahlquist's story. Skip it!  S. Russel 
 I got this as a gift for my 18 month old son. It only produces one lousy bubble with each pull of the handle, very sad. My son got very frustrated and so did I. I would not recommend this product. 
 There is simply not enough value in this book to justify using it.  I'm sorry but words like Alta Vista and Cisco just should not appear anywhere in a value investing book.  Period and discussion over.  At least not up to the present.  Maybe in the future but I doubt it.  Also there is way too much verbage to describe much of nothing.  The modern budding value investor would be better served by other book including Security Analysis by Graham.  A lot of detail is missing here and much of the analysis leaves one wondering if the authors know what value investing really is 
 You know a film is bad when you can't even finish watching it.  1. Russians don't fly F-16s or Northrop Tigersharks 2. Used airial combat scenes from Top Gun, Navy Seals and Iron Eagle. 3. Used ground explosions from Iron Eagle 4. SpecOp Forces don't manuever around like they are playing on a paintball range. 5. Editing was horrid (Airial cut scenes from films that take place in the middle eastern desert then jumps to what look like Pennsylvania woods) 6. Acting was so bad I started to chuckle at the cheesey lines and delivery. 7. Plot would be better suited for a computer game. 8. Captain of the 'USS Oakla'(no such ships exists) has a hat with SSN depicting his CARRIER's Class; well SSN means the hull classification symbol used by the United States Navy for an attack submarine that is propelled by nuclear energy, such as the Los Angeles-class of attack SUBMARINES.  This was as far as I got, about 50 minutes into the film. I'm no critic and can enjoy a film for what it is but this was the most slapped together garbage I have ever seen 
 This blender has been emitting a motor-burning smell since the day I got it. I thought it would go away, but it has only gotten worse. Definitely does not do what it says it does, all speeds perform the same. What a waste of money! 
 This book was listed on our summer reading list the summer before I started law school, so I bought it.  It is still in brand-new, perfect condition.  Why?  Because I tried to read it.  And failed.  Miserably.  I was a philosophy major in college.  I generally have a lot of patience for long, dense, boring works.  But this one?  I understood it, but I didn't find it worth my time.  This book is a key Libertarian text.  I am not a Libertarian.  I am a Liberal.  There seemed to be nothing in the book with which I could identify.  The views of the author were SO far from mine that I just felt like it was a waste of time for me to read it.  And that's not a decision I regret 
 Since you're reading about this book, I assume you're interested in a scholarly work, as opposed to "Idiot's Guide" or "___ for Dummies" style.  In this case, I recommend that you read instead "The Legacy of Jihad" by Andrew Bostom and Hugh Fitzgerald, a scholarly work that is more comprehensive, better researched, and more objective.  I purchased both books, but after reading a few hundred pages of both, I decided to keep "The Legacy of Jihad" and return "The Venture of Islam" to the bookstore 
 I thought that this was an SATA hard drive because the label is ATA/100, but is in in fact an EIDE hard drive, so when i bought it I was unable to install it. This was probably my fault, but no where in the product description does it say that it is EIDE so I am putting this review up in hopes that no one else mistakenly buys this hard drive. 
 Unlike other reviewers, I have no problem with the fact that many of the tracks feature Charlie Poole's contemporaries. Arguably, these serve to highlight his stylistic innovations.  However, the non-standard packaging is truly annoying. Unless they have very narrow musical interests, most people purchasing these CDs will have fairly large music collections. Although wonderfully written and informative, the way oversized booklet is doomed to be lost on a back shelf or perhaps in the dustbin of history. The oversized cardboard cigar box that replaces the standard jewel case is a cheesy gimmick that must either be enshrined or, more probably, thrown out. What you're left with is 3 CDs in paper sleeves that will become lost among your other CDs once they're no longer in the immediate rotation on your CD player. For these reasons, minus three stars from the five this compilation deserves 
 I have found this book to be confusing to use and therefore of little to no value. If I had seen in a bookstore and not Online I would not have purchased it. I also purchased Schaum's Outline of General Topology which is very good 
 I think this novel is best for younger readers.  I found it a little cheesy.  I stopped reading it after 60 pages because the comic strips got annoying and it could not hold my attention.  
 Poor sweet Christina!!!  I'm a HUGE Christina fan and worship the ground she walks on! In my eyes she can do no wrong, that is until I heard this album. I was in my local CD store and always check out the Aguilera section for the chance of finding imported gems from overseas (I live in Australia so not everything comes our way). Saw this album which I had never heard of and decide I HAD to have it. Went home, put it on and I couldn't cope. My ears started to bleed!!! What had happened, was it some cheap imposter? It sounded like Christina had recorded it on a tape deck, in her garage, using a yamaha keyboard and some BAD (shudder) backing music. Its scary what a no money and some vile producers can do to an amazing singer. No wonder she wanted this album banned. Initially I wanted my money back, but I can cope with the fact that I know own some dodgy bit of Christina's past. I have not yet listened to it all the way through, I couldn't!!! I probably never will. I will file it away in my collection, perhaps incase it in concrete so it can never be played out loud again.... Just as Christina would have wanted. PS I am hanging out for the follow up to Stripped!! 
 I can't believe how many people are saying how "realistic" this game is.  That can not be further from the truth.  All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80% of the time regardless of coverage.  What fun is that?  This in itself is highly unrealistic.  Don't even get me started on the other things this game does. NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game, realism is thrown out the window in this one.  EA does not know the meaning of AI.  The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does.  Don't waste your money, and don't make EA any more richer, its obvious they just throw these games together.  They just take our money and laugh all the way to the bank.  
 Some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all, but the Nikon 8400 has a "electronic viewfinder" and the reviews have been good and the price is great, so I bought the camera.  The electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash, you cannot see any expressions, just the outline of the person's head, so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder.  Outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot.   The "display" LCD monitor is small and washes out in sunlight.  The background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark.  After 3 days of use and 90 shots I mailed it back to "Ritz on Amazon" this morning, Dec 5.  They require it back "within 10 days of receipt of purchase", their "date of order" was Nov 29 and it arrived at my house on Dec 3.  It's a good thing I already had a compact flash card to use, there is not one in the box and if I had waited for the one I ordered to arrive, well, it's not here yet.  It cost me $11.65 to return it, insured, with 2 day delivery and a "delivery confirmation receipt".  The camera had some strengths as well as it's weaknesses, but with only a short time to try it out before the "10 days" ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what I was shooting I gave up on it 
 The Charlie Moon series is getting more amusing and more "spiritual", for lack of a better word, as it evolves. Certainly, Moon has become a more interesting character.  He was always more interesting than the earlier protaganist in the series Scott Parris. I enjoy the series but it is not my favorite reading. I find hiding of clues and information from the reader irritating.  
 I teach third graders who read at a 5th-9th grade level. The first problem with this book is that, on the back, in huge, yellow letters, is, "Learn more about your Christain heros!  Read what traditional  educators try to keep from you!"  Not a good thing to send home. 	  This book was much too difficult for them, not just because of the  unnecessarily thick language. It is very poorly written.  The prose is  wordy and full of characters who are only mentioned once and then  forgotten.  The children claimed to like and understand this book, but  their retention and actual understanding was nil 
 I have to say I was very disappointed with this book when it arrived.  I bore with it for the first hundred pages although I felt that there was too much emphasis on why we use this type of teaching method and not enough information on how. I wanted ideas that I felt would work with my students and I found very few of these, some of the suggestions were just plain silly and would turn a literature discussion into a type of group therapy such as 'what memory does this poem remind you of'.  I don't know, maybe American students are different to Irish ones, but I know mine have a resistance to exposing the inner workings of their hearts and minds to fellow students who would possibly find it hilarious and I know that although reader response criticism is a good counterbalance to the way literature was taught in our day when the thoughts and feelings of the student didn't matter too much, has the pendulum swung too far in the other direction? Aren't we supposed to be discussing literary texts, not the psyches of our students.  Anyway, I felt that many of these suggestions just wouldn't work with many classes and that there was very little that I could actually apply or that would improve my teaching 
 This explores the sociopolitical causes and ramifications in the development of modern infrastructure. But due to continual stating and restating of simple points, a reader loses track of what the authors are attempting to train his attention on. With all the research the authors have done on the subject matter, you might expect that; but it could take you a year of poring over this to get the full thrust of this. It certainly isn't concise.  The books real problem is the writing style. The text is a hybrid of bureaucratic and academic writing, defensively constructed to obviate charges of ambiguity or assumption. Here's a typical sentence: "Thus we could argue that the supplementation of state forms of collectivised infrastructure development that supported the modern ideal with privatised regimes that need to attract international finance capital seems very likely to support the splintering of integrated and bundled networks into a myriad of individually financed and managed infrastructure projects."  You can go a few pages before encountering a sentence that hasn't been overworked like this. Torpid.  The other big problem is it's design. What you get out of it will depend on whether you can overcome the disruptive format. Just when you've finally bit into a passage of that writing, a new heading in boldface interrupts both the text and your concentration. This occurs once or twice a page for 400 pages. It isn't helpful. Is this a book, or is it six hundred short articles? Frequent sidebars also induce reader distraction. 
 I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.  
 I cannot stress this enough, this book is very boring and longwinded.  Only if you are doing research on this time period do you need to even consider this book.  It book talks very little about the Declaration and more about famous people that you already know about 
 I thought that this book was very harsh and critical of some groups of people.  I thought that it was quite insulting to men and whites.  I thought it was well writtten, and i loved the first couple sections about  Walker's ideas of activism rooted in love, but i found that as the book  progressed it seemed to become more of a praise of certain kinds of people  rather than praising all people and loving all people like it was claimed  earlier in the book.  Overall, Walker had good ideas, I just found that  sometime they were expressed in a manner of insult 
 Mere Christianity is a book often recommended to atheists by Christians and is touted as a rational, logical case for the Christian religion. Unfortunately, well-informed atheists will find that Lewis quickly uses a god of the gaps argument to explain his concept of Moral Law. Lewis's Moral Law argument will not fool anyone with a basic understanding of social evolution. All cultures have some prohibition against stealing and murder as well as some glorification of selflessness and compassion, but this is due not to a Lawgiver but to social evolution. The reason we have these moral characteristics is because they helped us to survive. Any tribe of humans who permitted murder or glorified betrayal would fall apart and die out quickly.  A warning to all atheists who pick up this book: Don't bother reading past Book 1. The Moral Law is the keystone of Lewis's argument. Without it, everything else he says is meaningless to atheists 
 I found this more confusing than helpful. It had me looking for screens that did not exist and it jumped around a lot. I finally put the book down and figured it out myself using the XP wizard and help screens. I feel like I wasted my money on this book 
 I bought this book imagining how much easier and heathier meal planning could be.  What I discovered, after spending $120 for the first week of menus, was that this is not for me.  I spent 1.5 hours in the kitchen on the first night of cooking!  I am a very busy, working mom.  I do not have that much time to spend on preparation, nor the money to spend over $100 per week on food items that I only use a portion of then throw away!  I need a meal plan that re-uses leftovers (i.e., most of the english muffins in a bag instead of just one) and is more time/cost conscientious.  Hopefully, I will have better luck with my next purchase 
 And yes, I do believe it's a big scam.    The sad truth of being human is that everyone feels anger and stress and fear. It's part of life (though first-worlders may do better at avoiding it than some). If back pain were caused by stress,  or even just exacerbated by it, then people in refugee camps, soldiers, and people with serious illnesses like cancer would get it in higher proportion, right? But in all my reading, I've never heard that this is the case.   Doctors don't understand back pain, period. It used to be that they didn't understand stomach ulcers either and therefore also attributed them to stress. In this case also, quite a few patients felt better by adopting a less stressful life or eating bland food. Now we know that ulcers are caused by a bacteria and that this malady completely unaffected by food choice. Yet for years, doctors were convinced that their remedies were effective.  In my opinion, stress is a catch-all "cause" that is applied to many  misunderstood diseases (particularly those common in women, but that's another subject). We all know stress is unpleasant, but does it really cause sickness? Couldn't stress just be an easy answer to a tough question? In the 19th century, temperment was thought to cause TB. And in the 17th century, strange illnesses were attributed to witchcraft. The human mind has trouble saying: I don't know. Doctors have trouble saying: I don't know why you're in pain.  Furthermore, Dr. Sarno offers no justification for leaving his theories untested by scientific method. Even a small double-blind study would be illuminating. It doesn't even have to be double-blind--just a study of some kind would be nice. Someday someone will figure out how the back works, and then Dr. Sarno's going to look like a big dummy. Frankly, I hope I'm around to see that. 
 I have worked with two women who have worn this perfume, and frankly, I can't stand the smell of it. It doesn't even smell like perfume, it is like some bizarre animal musk. There are no floral notes, and no woodsy notes, either; nothing clean or fresh or pleasant. I wish this perfume didn't exist---I hate it. 
 There's "scientific" hype attached to this argument, but it's the same stuff we've been treated to since the earliest attempts by Europeans to rationalize colonialism and slavery. When you've got some moron blathering about "communist propaganda" in a short review lauding this book, you know this is just red meat for the  dogs. And Steve Sailer is a notorious far-right apologist for racialist theories who regularly hangs his hat at the neo-racist VDARE website. If you want a taste of what's behind this line of argument and where it all leads, check them out. The fact that the author invokes breeds of dogs to rationalize his discredited theories is proof enough of how far out on a limb these guys are. I, incidentally, live in a town and a neighborhood that's as mixed ethnically as any in America and have a "racially mixed" family, so I know up close and personal how this crap is just feeding some very ugly strains in our body politic and that it has all of the scientific gravitas of one of Charles Murray's synthetic  tracts or the "Hutu" vs. "Tutsi" faux-tribal inheritance of European colonial masters that was used to justify genocide in Rwanda. Europeans aren't the only guilty parties, but any notion of European genetic superiority is a grotesque legacy  of one of history's ugliest epochs. Read "Guns, Germs and Steel" if you want to dig into the basis of human "difference" in a historical as opposed to a recycled racist context 
 I was looking for a book that would give me some great recipes to use with my new food processor.  I was not happy with this one. There aren't a whole lot of recipes and a lot of the ingredients are not very common in our household.  I usually have capers, anchovy paste, greek olive etc. So I am not talking ketchup and mustard here.  I am talking about tahini, lemon grass, and indian relish (what is that, and where do you get it?)  I enjoy cooking for my family, but I am more apt to use recipes with ingredients I will use for other recipes.  In addition, a lot of the recipes are very complex, which is okay, but cooking doesn't have to be complex to be either gourmet, or tastey.  There are a couple of recipes I will try:  Mushroom caviar, Oh-my-God Cheesecake and Stuffed Artichokes.  Other recipes I will probably never do are: Sweet Potato Soup w/ coconut milk, lemongrass & cilantro, Terrine of Pork & Ham w/ Calvados & Juniper Berries, Leek & Sweet Red Pepper flan, Chicken Liver & Red Onion Jam. I also ordered The Food Processor Bible.  There are many more recipes that aren't so elaborate and more for daily use 
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 This review concerns the original 1932 edition and the revised edition published in the 1960's.  Both books follow the same plot; although, the revised edition is slightly different from the original.  While returning from a carnival, Nancy, George and Bess witness a large home suddenly burst into flames.  Thinking that there may be someone trapped inside, the girls rush to the house to help.  They are unable to enter the home because of the heat, but Nancy spots a man running away from the house and later finds a diary, written in Swedish, which contains numerous technical drawings.  Did the man start the fire?  Does the diary belong to him?  And what became of Felix Raybolt, the owner if the home, who apparently has gone missing?  Clues lead Nancy to suspect that the diary belongs to the husband of a poor woman that Nancy met at the carnival along with her little girl.  Nancy becomes determined to prove that Joe Swenson didn't start the fire, but all of the clues she uncovers seem to suggest that he is guilty.  Personally, I didn't find this book very good; there isn't much action, the mystery isn't very exciting and the book really lacks a true criminal.  Thankfully, the writing style used in the book is rather enjoyable, so it keeps the book from being a complete waste of time.  One thing to note about this book is that this is the volume where Nancy meets Ned Nickerson and oddly enough her first thought of him is that he is trying to steal her car!  This book is worth reading for the writing, but its not likely that many fans of Nancy Drew will find this book to be one of their favorites 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 Like Carpenter, Ballard suffers from poor execution of some good ideas. John Carpenter may or may not have been a good director once (depending on your point of view), but for the past 20 years he has consistently put out movies where the premise looks engaging on paper (Prince of Darkness, They Live, etc.), but quickly fall into a semi-coherent mess. Likewise Ballard, who is at best coasting on the reputation of a 30 year old book. Ballard has had some great visionary ideas, but his sad insistence on overfocusing on sexual perversion as a compelling/repelling drive for his characters got tired a long, long time ago. If Tom Robbins was a humorless German surgeon instead of an aging hippie, you'd get a close approximation of Ballard's hang-ups. In Ballard's world, all forms of sexual expression are deviant, creepily desperate, and universally abundant. Ballard no longer seems like a literary provocateur, but more like a pedophilic, self-important older uncle that your family would rather not discuss. "Super-Cannes" is Ballard's rewrite of "Fight Club", with the rich and powerful assuming the roles of the disillusioned and powerless 
 Do not bother to buy this sewing machine case.  It is crappy!  Don't be fooled by the "Universal" phrase of this product.  I have a Brother sewing machine so i bought this item. When i got it, i placed my sewing machine and i rattles around inside the case.  I don't see what is so "Universal" about this.  There is too much room inside and my machine tips over to its sides when i lift to carry the case.  It's terrible!!!  I'd give NO star but i don't have that choice on the selection.  I wanted to return it but it's not worth the shipping charge that will incure on my refund due to Amazon's policies.  By then i would probably only get at most $12.00 back in refunds 
 This was a Medieval Project in my 7th Grade Humanities class   The Summary: Catherine Called Birdy was a conflict type book. It was mostly about her pig head of a father trying to sell her to the richest man. If you like the way it sounds now you should look for a copy. It is quite interesting and has a lot of conflict in the book.  A phew funny things were when Catherine caught some objects on fire! Rating: I rated my book 2  stars because it was kind of boring. Why is because all the book was really about was Catherine's father trying to sell off to the richest man. When I did like it was when she tried to get out of each man. Who this book would be suited for:  I would recommend this book to someone who really likes conflict books in the Medieval times. Also is if you are interested in action books. 
 it's so obvious there's no chemistry at all between the guy who played the tabloid writer and the woman who played the prime minister. they were just like two actors who signed up separately and had to carry it out and play to the end. there's nothing between them. the screenplay was also quite lame. nothing to be excited about. a quite ridiculous and lame fairy tale. 
 I loved this phone, but after only a few weeks the button is stuck and the phone can't pick up.  I want it fixed but don't know how 
 These books are ok. Just not my preference. They just don't have the same feel as other Nancy Drew, they seem to have lowered the maturity level off Nancy and upped the mature relationship between Nancy and Ned. It's still fun to read but just not the Nancy Drew I know 
 I gave this book 2 stars, because it's a good reference for seed bead techniques.  If that's what you're looking for, and you are a beginning beader, you might find this book useful, although many of the same techniques can be found in the back of most beading magazines.  I found the rest of the book to be extremely disappointing, offering little more than illustrations.  I am new to this hobby, and there wasn't much there (other than the seed bead techniques) that I couldn't figure out by looking at the illustrations or going to my local bead store 
 As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows.  To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper.  It stayed very "surface level" with me, reads almost like a "young adult" novel.  Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it.  
 i bought this thinking it was going to be really cool, but it was very boring and stupid.  it contains 3 puzzles all of which a 5 yr old can do and the games are the most stupid games ever.  the one with the spinner only shows the objects on the puzzle move smaller as you look at it.  thats the whole thing.  your pupil is just going back to its smaller, regular size and it makes the picture look like it's getting smaller.  and the one with the magic cards is rediculous.  anyone can see that all you have to do is choose the cards that you can see the character you chose through.  very disapointing.  i wish i could have seen the box before i bought it.  then i would have seen just how lame this was 
 The book is basically a dialogue from the author's class on visual basic databases.  I found this writing style to be very annoying and not easy to follow.  The whole book is centered around one project and presents a narrow viewpoint rather than the more comprehensive approach to database design I was looking for 
 The characters are all over the top dysfunctional.  The main character is boring and self destructive.  When the characters are not likeable who cares what has or will happen to them??  This book reads like a 1970's Movie of the Week starring Lindsay Wagner.  
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.  On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.  I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?   90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.   Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.  At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK.  "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer)  Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.  Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra.  Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." (both in books and on video) 
 This is a wonderfully researched book and well written as you'd expect from Mr. Owen, and I enjoyed reading it. But wondered if I was the only one who thought it was ruined by the obsessive desire to defend Cliff Roberts,  even on matters that really seem pointless. So I came here to read reviews  and I couldn't help but notice that many of the glowing reviews here on  Amazon appeared to be written by the same person, but I was glad to see  some agreed with me about the format of the book. I suppose it's a must for  the pictures if you want to see the course the way it once was, but I  recommend avoiding it if you get irritated with a book that has an agenda  and seems to go out of its way to not just tell the story, but to address  issues that someone wanted addressed 
 Why someone would chose these books is beyond me, especially when there are so many other good choices. Literature has an impact on people and the only impact I can imagine Junie having on others is negative.  My daughter's first grade teacher is reading the Stupid Smelly School Bus to her class right now. Wanting to be an involved parent, I borrowed a copy from the friend and read it too. Junie is a brat. She thinks like a brat and acts like a brat.   Our family says, "Thanks, but no thanks! 
 Probably this book went way over my head.   The one insight I think I got from it was that during the tech boom, many of the new products were appearing, not because of some fundamental increase in the rate of innovation brought on by the Web, but because of all the money pouring into startups because investors believed the Web would lead to such innovations for technological reasons. A phenomena Soros calls "reflexivity", I guess. But even without knowing that it seemed clear a boom was in progress that would eventually bust. But how to know when? It doesn't seem this book or Soros could tell you.  I hear Soros became a billionaire through his investments and that seemed well beyond a chance event, but I didn't understand  anything in this book to explain how that happened. Speculations about global politics and finance, then a big dash of intuition, and then at times a gain, at times a loss. I don't follow in Soros's case why his gains exceeded his losses. There are others who don't believe in unbiased marketes, why didn't they similarly profit to such an extent. And just knowing that markets are biased, how does it tell you how to time? Perhaps Soros benefitted from adjusting his market positions quickly if his assumptions weren't confirmed by the market: would that help and to such an extent?  It's not clear to me that Soros' explanations in this book are closely related, if at all, to his successes. It may be helpful to be exposed to his mindset, if this book does that, but, after  finishing it, it isn't clear how to apply what I've read. I won't not recommend this book, because I may very well be missing a lot of what it says. Other people's books may not make you a billionaire. But I haven't figured out whether this one will make me one or even allow me to pay for a new car. "The Alchemy of Finance" seems to be about bold gambling I wouldn't want to do with any money I may someday need.      
 In high school "Stroke You Up" was the jam, so I went downtown and bought the cassette. Let me tell you something: It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring. Even "Stroke You Up" became unbearable to listen to. No funk, no groove- just lukewarm soul. That was the first *and* the last time I listened to "Changing Faces." The two chicks who made up "Changing Faces" had airy, monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all. Even the album cover looked boring. These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all. Skip this at all costs and get Zhane 
 Knowing the author by name and by reputation, I borrowed this book from a friend rather than contributing to him financially by paying for it.  It's just the kind of pseudo-scientific garbage I'd expect when someone schooled in Philosophy is allowed to write a book on a scientific topic.  The serious question of whether - and to what degree - nonhuman animals experience emotion should be entered into not only with skepticism, but with knowledge of how Science should be carried out, and how to go about evaluating the data that results.  Masson is qualified to do NONE of these, and seems utterly unaware of that handicap.  It's precisely what I'd expect from someone who romanticizes the barbaric acts of the Animal Liberation Front, however, a terrorist group that firebombs research facilities and university labs, then enters high schools and teaches those same tactics to our children.  To my mine, Masson should share a prison cell for supporting them in his idiotic writings 
 Here's what this book never explained:  if you are WILLING to cook at all, you can cook anything you want.  So why do you need this book?  You don't.  Cooking for yourself is a personal hurdle that you either accomplish or you don't.  If you can get to the point of cooking at all, then you don't need this book...the world is at your dutch oven.  The advice in the book is nothing that you haven't read in ANY magazine that you can pick up, whether it's a men's health magazine or even any ladies magazine.  The recipes may as well have been gleaned from the same pages as those same magazines.  There was NOTHING in this book new.   This was a major league disappointment 
 I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery.  I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing.  The characters were one-dimensional.  After discovering who the "bad guys" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification.  Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  "...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours."  Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted.  I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little 
 And if you're not into comics, you won't care. What was Ronin Ro on?   Aside from glaring proofreading mistakes (on the same page, we are told that Kirby was stationed at an army base in 1945 and honorably discharged in 1943), this writer decides to take one of the most interesting and argued-about subjects in popular culture and present it as one continuous, here's-what-happened narrative, without ever citing his sources. No pictures, no index, nothing's ever sourced, corroborated or contested. Not only are conflicting versions of events never explored, but neither are the various other books and magazines Ro cribbed from ever cited. Hack-work, through and through.  If I sound angry, it's because this should have been great, at least as absorbing as Gerard Jones's excellent book, Men of Tomorrow. A good version of this book can be done, and I'd gladly shell out hardcover money for it.  Instead, it's like standing in a comics store, listening to some fool blather on, thinking to yourself, "you don't know that. How can anybody know that? Who told you that? You made that up," and finally, "just ring me up and let me out of here. 
 The only good part of the movie was when the female protagonist gets a phone call that the killer is inside house which was in the beginning of the movie. The rest was really boring. Don't get me wrong, i don't mind a slow paced movie which were prominent in the 1970's and 1980's but this movie was so dreadful. This movie isn't origianl in terms of the horror subgenre of a slasher/killer calls by phone type of movie. Black Christmas 1974 was the original slasher flick/killer calls by phone type of movie. When a Stranger Calls flat out copied the scene from Black Christmas. In Black Christmas 1974, A sorority sister gets a really creepy and scary calls in the house. The police then trace the call and says that the killer is upstairs in the house. Of course Psycho was the first American modern horror and the 2nd is Black Christmas. 
 Patrick Swayze worst movie ever you hardly ever seen him in the movie pluse you had to read the whole thing, Forest Whitaker scene's was probobly the best thing about the movie maybe This movie would of been much better without the Letter box Verson and  that's a big mayb 
 Becareful, I read a review here that said that this is the book from PBS... It IS NOT. I bought the book after reading the review and just sent it back. It is not even by the same authors who wrote the PBS book. I agree with some of the other reviewers, this sounds like  a scam job at the expense of children and their parents. I may have kept the book if I wasn't so upset about being deceived. If you are looking for the PBS book it is called "The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions" by John & Danita Thomas. I have sent an email to the authors about this rip off book, I hope they take some type of action 
 I was looking forward to hearing this CD after everything I had read and heard about the production, but I found it a major disappointment. The premise of a fusty old show queen liking a show this bad just didn't work for me. The songs are more TV jingle-like than anything that recalls music from the Roaring '20s. I gave up trying to wade through the synopsis to figure out why Sutton Foster is singing that dull--and LONG!--song about the monkey. Cute is not a substitute for witty--the writers of this show must not know that. Don't waste your money on this one 
 When I read Irving's "Son of the Circus" I thought that he would never write a better book. Sadly, I was right. "Widow for One Year" was a letdown, "The Fourth Hand" even worse. I began this book with some hope, but my hopes were quickly dashed. Irving's sense of the absurd has gotten out of hand, and "Until I Find You" is like reading a bad parody of his work. For one thing, virtually every part of his plot is simply implausible. The sex scenes between the children, however, was where this book got tossed into the trashcan. Irving apparently has no real sense of how children think of sex (which of course they do!) or how boys deal with girls. He has dedicated this junkheap of a book to his own young son, but when the boy finally is old enough to read it, I'm afraid he'll be as horrified as I. Beginning with "Garp" I devoured all his books. John Irving used to be one of those authors it was absolutely necessary to read, but now I'll never read another. This book was a waste of time and money and I resent every minute I lost reading it 
 I personally don't like this book. I really couldn't get into it and found it nearly impossible to read for more than ten minutes. This book probably has all the correct techniques in it but I couldn't find the 
 Hit and Run is a typical rock bio, full of the cliches and inaccuracies that we can expect from an uncreative person trying to write about, in this case, a truly creative person.  Hopkins takes a person who is publicly known due to talent, work, and accomplishment and reduces him to a fashion plate without a real job mindlessly indulging in the trends and vices of his time.  The author predictably hops from one conspiciuous milestone to the next with little insight into the music and even less into the man.  This book shows how short-form rock journalism extended to biography is an injustice to a significant artist who deserves a better profile.  Fortunately this artist already has in such books as Black Gold, Crosstown Traffic, and others 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 Nothing wrong with this version of Powers' stories, but I prefer the original, unabridged "Prince of Darkness and Other Stories" which is available in Doubleday paperback, first published back when Powers was hailed as "a compelling young talent in American fiction, perhaps the most exciting short-story writer to emerge since Eudora Welty."  -- Philadelphia Inquirer.    The Doubleday Image Books imprint set about "making the world's finest Catholic literature avilable to all..."  True, Mr. Powers' work is formed by his Catholicism, but in subject matter, he writes about baseball and jazz, old people and boys, boxers and more.  He has, The New Yorker once observed,"few rivals at creating characters with more than superficial reality. 
 This is a poor excuse for a thriller.  It lacked suspense, was too unbelievable, and wallowed in gut-churning violence.  The psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Clevenger, is given too much time and power by the police to help solve the hostage crisis, especially considering that psychopath Trevor Lucas has already mutilated one person and is likely to endanger the lives of the other people he has hostage (including a pregnant woman).  Clevenger is a hard person to sympathize with, what with his drug addiction and penchant for call girls (I also found it unbelievable that he could function very well while on heroin, and that no one-- not even police officers-- could recognize his condition).  Not only that, Clevenger's success in tracking down Lucas' brother relied too much on luck and coincidence, and the ending was too neat and tidy, especially given the intelligence and volatile nature of Lucas, and the depth and complexity of his problems.  Very unsatisfying thriller 
 I was rather dissappointed at the content offered and barely impressed at the book's attempt at teaching new skills.  I bought the book for my 5, 7 and 9 year old children and the 9 year-old had already mastered all of the skills offered, the 7 year-old was bored very quickly and only the 5 year old's attention was held any length of time, but his age group lacks the concetration level to hang on for long.  The content was far too simple and barely progressed through the entire book...this book should be marketed to only highly introverted 4-6 year-olds in my opinion, and then it would get only 3 stars... 
 Ok, just by looking at the cover of this book, you get the idea that it isn't for anyone over the age of 10.  Once you flip through the pages, that becomes more and more apparent.  So, what is STARGYMNAST thinking?  She sounds like a walking advertisement for Lynette Jennings. Actual teenagers will have absolutely no interest in this book unless they're on Trading Spaces and want to horrify their neighbor.  Go find something sophisticated 
 Joan Grant was born into a well-off family and this book describes her childhood and young adulthood mainly in terms of nannies, holidays, parties etc.  I didn't feel particularly drawn into the narrative - we rarely get to know the characters she introduces.  The discovery of her past lives is of course interesting, so for someone who's already read about them, it's nice to find out who she was. However, as a piece of literature, I don't rate this book very highly (it's nothing like Winged Pharaoh) 
 Good basic overview - kinda bland.  Too expensive for the material within 
 Well, I had to succumb.  I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad.  My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded.  This film reaches new cinematic depths.  It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate.  Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever!  I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks.  Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful.  Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.  To get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness I'm going to have to watch an actual good movie, like "Showgirls" 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 war books are not my favorite, but even so this book sucked. i will admit when i am wrong about a book but i was not wrong about this 1. from the moment my prof. assigned it, i knew it would be like pulling teeth to finish and it was! this is notttttttttttttttttttttt a classic or anything close to 1. spend ur ten dollars on a pillow cause you are going to need it 
 Roger G.Kennedy is a man on a mission: to embellish, lie and slander Thomas Jefferson. Kennedy is the typical modern biographer,always ready to destroy another one of America's heroes. In the sad and cynical fashion of today, Kennedy does his best to paint Thomas Jefferson as a lousy President, slaveholder and racist. The book is deplorable, just as most modern American history has become. I am sure the modern left, postmodernist, deconstructionist crowd loves this piece. It has all of the nihlism, lies, and propaganda one would expect from a "profession" laden with Marxists and Leninsts who would like nothing better than to see another American icon destroyed. A real piece of garbage 
 It's important for a director to immediately establish a level of trust with his/her audience. We need to believe that we are in capable hands that will introduce us to characters and situations that make perfect sense, and that events will follow one another with unyielding logic.  At first, I felt that a decision made early in the film was a decision that was outside the "trust" I described above. Toward the end of the film, I realized that the decision was OK - even though I thought it was a bad idea on the filmmaker's part to make that particular decision. I wish that the screenwriters had worked harder to come up with a different way to get from point A to point B. The problem with the "real" decision was that I lost faith in the director/story almost immediately because it appeared - at the time - to be utterly ridiculous.  There was a scene where a cat came jumping out of a closet for shock value, and my lord, I can't count the number of times where that tired old trick has been used. Whenever that happens, I immediately think that someone's being lazy and can't come up with a better way to give the audience a quick scare. Besides - it's quite awful to leave a cat locked up in a closet because they tend to start using it as their bathroom, and you just can't get cat pee out of *anything*.  As the movie progressed, it began to move in a fairly reasonable logic flow, and I started to gain trust in the director/story again, even though there were some unnecessary characters and scenes.   Dakota Fanning (Emily), is an amazing actress whose ability to portray a wide range of emotions that many actors and actresses with years more training and experience would give their left foot for, is the perfect character for the part. We see her happy, we see her completely dead inside, and we see her unbearably terrified. Her tremors and tears are terrors ring true. She is the best actor in the film. (Which is saying quite a bit.)  The movie is about a man whose wife dies and he moves to the country to help his daughter cope. This didn't make sense to me, because as a psychologist, the father, David, (DeNiro), should have known that was just plain stupid. We don't see many emotions from DeNiro after his wife dies, and that too disturbed me. Again - I didn't feel in capable hands, so I questioned everything that looked wrong.  While in a beautiful house in the country, Emily has what everyone calls an imaginary friend - Charlie. David is frustrated by this, and has a few conversations with a former student of his that is close to Emily.  And that's where the story starts to pick up. Charlie is more and more a part of Emily's life, and David feels isolated.  In the end, it seemed that the movie was going for a "Sixth Sense" feel, and it almost achieved it, but fell short. We're shown the obligatory flashbacks, but they aren't as convincing, shocking, or as immediately understood  as those that occurred in Shyamalan's film. (I saw "The Sixth Sense" in the theater in its opening weekend. As I'm hard of hearing, I wear headsets that, thankfully, drown out idiots who like to talk through films. However, those headsets couldn't keep me from hearing the shocked gasps from the audience. It's a shame that Shyamalan has been trying to recreate that same shock in the rest of his films, because he's failed miserably.) If "Hide and Seek" wasn't incorporating the elemental template of "The Sixth Sense", it would have made for a more interesting film. Or if "The Sixth Sense" had never been made, it might have been more interesting. But I don't think it would have been much more interesting, because as I said, the flashbacks and the shocks that those flashbacks were supposed to cause fell short.  Case in point: "The Sixth Sense" has a rating of 8.2 on imdb.pro, and Hide and Seek has a rating of 5.5. I tend to trust those ratings, because members of imdb.pro are film aficionados, and thousands of people (129,000 for SS and 13,600 for HaS) cast votes. It's a good sample. 
 I can't say the word demagogue enough...an absolutely awful book that reads more like a political manifesto than a non-fiction work.  I use the term non-fiction loosly 
 Sue Jones did allow non-sufferers a descriptive glimpse into the daily struggles with this illness, but I found the overall tone in her writing laced with too much over-the-top dramatic and corny quasi poetry.   As a long time fellow sufferer I found myself cringing through her prose. I found the writing style "rough" and amateurish.  I was expecting some new insight and information, but was left feeling like she wrote this book to promote her message board full of devotees to the unsubstantiated "quai" treatment. If you like the wordy and fluffy journal-blog/message board style - go for it.  If you are looking for realistic treatment options - pass on this.  It's a quick read.  Yes, the author expresses deep empathy for fellow sufferers, gratitude for the support she receives from her family and her faith is obvious.  She doesn't offer much more than words of encouragement layered with honey dripping dramatic chapters about the woes of this syndrome.   I was left disappointed, hoping for a more fact laden presentation.  Massive amounts of mucus thinners for months on end, lining the pocket of this doctor who is tauting the treatment, promoting the message board? No thanks. These people are being given false hope while enduring the suffering. Why anyone buys into this is beyond me. I'm a medical professional and I found it absurd to say the least. 
 Where's the father in this story?  With all the unfortunate divorcing going on in this world, I plan to inundate my child with stories about happy families with both a mom and a dad.  If it doesn't work out for him when he grows up and gets married, at least I can say I tried my best.  I'm tired of forcing the feminist agenda on our kids.  They need to know that not having a GOOD husband/father at home is not a good thing. Also, I thought the book was boring and the chair was ugly. 
 The player came in excellenct condition.  Exactly what we were looking for: compact, sturdy, a pleasure to look at, easy for a 4-year-old to use. But as a previous reviewer commented, it refused to play all songs on any cd inserted.  Out of 13 songs, it only played 9.  I tried many different cds, but to no avail.  My product was returned the day after I received it 
 Miller's central theme is that Picasso, like Einstein, was inspired by the emerging ideas of time, space, and the fourth dimension. In his effort to find parallels in the roles the two men played in their respective fields, the author becomes carried away with twisted logic and hyperbole. He tells us, for example, that Picasso's ideas, such as cutting a piece of newspaper in the shape of an arm and gluing it to a picture of a guitar, were "break-throughs" on a par with Galileo's conception of the solar system.    We are told that Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon incorporated concepts of relativity and the fourth dimension that the author and his friends found in the work of Henri Poincare. They are said to have passed many hours in a cafe exploring the intricacies of advanced mathematics and physics. One wonders whether a more likely influence on Picasso's thought might have been the drugs he is said to have been taking.    In trying to contrive a parallel between the contributions of Einstein and Picasso, Miller overlooks a fundamental difference between science and art. Science is progressive; art is cumulative. Each new scientific contribution builds on what has gone before, replacing old ideas with new ones. An innovative work of art does not make earlier work outdated. It simply adds to a gallery that includes centuries of work by artists in countless different cultures. Thus when Picasso rejected the rules of perspective and painted a nude woman as a geometrical figure with eyes in the back of its head he was not discovering new principles that made all that had gone before obsolete. He was simply introducing yet another mode of artistic expression 
 I tried to keep an open-minded perspective on the arguments made in this book but they're just outrageous.  Despite the military flexing along the Taiwan Straits in 1996 (from where most of the arguments and extrapolations  in this book are drawn) and the recent verbal jousts during the  Presidential elections where the upsart and pro-independence DPP forged  ahead, China remains to be a superpower to be reckoned and does what any  other superpower would do to edge favorably.  What the writers here have  amassed is far-fetched scenarios and conclusions that makes it a good  science fiction if it weren't terrestial based 
 Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion.  Not much there.  Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection.  Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books.  I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works.  I don't own  much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place.  I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 I've read hundreds of business books over the years and this is probably in my top 3 worst books of all time.  I consider myself a fairly sophisticated real estate investor and this book gave me absolutely nothing.    Not worth anyones' time to read. Take a pass on this boo 
 While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and ""SOILER"" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way. 
 I bought this gloves so I wouldn't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime I went for a bag workout. One reviewer is clearly confused. They said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand. Turns out there is no metal bar in it, but instead it was plastic or something similar. Then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag I wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles. This has never happened to me before and I have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years. Yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years. Another thing I noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags. They get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them. Gave these gloves 2 stars since I liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work. But they need to be greatly improved upon. 
 As I read, I wondered to myself whether or not the authors that contributed to this anthology were serious. This had to be the worst thing I have ever read. If I knew how to give it less than one star,I would. A friend previewed it for me over the phone and I was turned off then. He couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't stop shaking my head. I was mostly annoyed by Zane trying her hand at this. Her erotica isn't that great and here she is branching into new territory? This book was horrible, not horror. It is an insult to the Kings and Queens of Horror to add this book to their genre. Try again folks, and add some thought this time 
 "Listen, Bunuel. What are we going to do? The witch has quit. Says: too much nudity. Who does she think she is - Mother Theresa?"  "I am a little busy, JP (Quiet, babe! Can't you see? I am talking to my producer here!). Just get another broad for the role: anybody, only with a good front."  "But, Maestro! We'd have to re-shoot half of the movie. Fernando is already talking of another engagement. In any event, with his rate if we use him again, it will be twenty years before we see any money from this flick. We might as well scrap the whole thing."  "Don't worry, JP. We'll keep shooting as if nothing happened. That's what being Great Director all about. They are morons, or why you think anyone would pay cash to see such garbage. Most won't even notice that the face is different, and those who do, will find a good explanation for it. Subliminal, surreal, existential, women are alike - all that nonsense, you know. Relax and have a drink." 
 Listening to this album had me almost convinced I was listening to 3 doors down, Papa Roach or even Dark New Day. But no, the album cover certified me that it was in deed Crossfade I was listening to...   Tony Byroads added a unique sound to the band and without him, the band has lost their novelty. Too bad.   It might still appeal to your ears if you just want an album that rocks, although you could probably get that from any other generic band. If you were looking for that particular sound produced in their first album, then you might be out of luck. 
 Absolutely unwatchable. Cliche-ridden. So silly it's very nearly offensive. It's like watching one long music video by a B-level rapper - full of dumb, beautiful women, buff, monkey-headed ghetto thugs, and jokey tricked-out cars. Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is laughable, the acting worse. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are more "Dumb and Dumber" than "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". Awful 
 Like so many others in these reviews (I should have read them first!), I can categorically say that this is one of the worst software/hardware products I've ever bought.  It does not work, tech support is useless, and you should not even try to make it work. I am a computer expert with a great computer, and there is ABSOUTELY NOTHING I can do to make this work.  Don't buy.  
 "When No One Sees" is part of a series of books produced by The Trinity Forum (Os Guinness, project director). Their stated purpose reads: "Contributing to the transformation and renewal of society through the transformation and renewal of leaders." Toward this end, "When No One Sees" aims to introduce the topic of the virtues of personal integrity, honesty, self-sacrifice and other important character traits as exemplified throughout history.   As a supplement to a fuller study in the importance of personal character and integrity, I can heartily recommend "When No One Sees." However, as a single, primary text for such a study, this book is deeply flawed. Although Guinness uses clear "gender accurate" grammar, and cites positive characters from different ages, countries, and races, he nonetheless presents only male heroes of character. Not one woman! Half the human race is utterly excluded from the author's list of examples. While, in the inset boxes, some women have been quoted briefly, nowhere does Guinness hold up a single woman of history as a positive example of character -- not even Mary the mother of Jesus.  Near the end of the book, Guinness actually states, "Many of the greatest heroes are unknown and unsung, unaware of their own significance" (p. 253), but he then continues to exclude women. This male-dominated selectivity is not a subtle problem or defect of "When No One Sees." It is a glaring and inexplicable fault which renders the book virtually useless as a primary text for church study groups or Christian college liberal arts courses. Guinness had a good idea in this project, but he needs to produce a more thorough second edition without the obvious male bias.  
 Brown wrote this one well into his 80s and you can see age taking its toll on him. The book praises Islamic mysticism and is his most religious work. It is a complete failure written by an old man who wasn't thinking straight 
 In his Preface, Feynman admits that these lectures were aimed at "the most intelligent students" coming out of high school into Caltech.  He also admits that many students had trouble with the content judging from their performance on the examinations and said that his system of lectures is "a failure".  I agree with Feynman.  These lectures are very hard to understand.  Partly the lectures, prepared in early 1960s, suffer from being rather dated.  Mostly though this material is presented in a confusing way, with lots of complicated mathematics that often hinders comprehension.  I recommend getting a basic college textbook instead (Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Wolfson and Pasachoff is a good choice) 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
  "Ben Kiernan, a leftist Ausrtalian academic and former apologist for the Khemer Rouge [...] in 1977 declared, 'There is ample evidence in Cambodia and other sources that the Khmer Rouge is not the monster that the press have recently made it out to be.' After renouncing this view, Kiernan was appointed director of the Cambodian Genocide Program, a tax-payer funded institute located at Yale University (it is as though a former Nazi sympathizer and Holocaust denier had been appointed to direct Washington's Holocaust museum.)"  "Notwithstanding the attempt of Kiernan and others to turn the Red (communist) Khmer into the Brown (fascist) Khmer, the origins of Khmer Rouge policies are easily traced to the Marcist ideology of the chinese Cultural Revolution in the mid-1960s."  These are extracted from pgs. 170-171 of Michael Lind's 'The Necessary War. Lind is a an anti-Bush democrat, by the way.  People must know what kind of people they are putting their money on when they buy. If you want to know about the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot there's no better (and more honorable) place than the books of (real intellectuals, not intellectual-prostitutes) Philip Short or Karl D. Jackson.  You are very welcome. 
 Este album es menos que basura. Las letras de las canciones no tienen sentido y la música suena horrible. Estos pseudo raperos no tienen idea de lo que es verdadero rap. Son unos pobres diablos imitadores de Cypress Hill, que no tienen nada importante que decir. No pierdas tu tiempo, ni mucho menos tu dinero, en este album que no vale ni un centavo 
 The only reason I bought this movie is because Alison Hannigan and Alexis Denisof was in it.(I'm a huge Buffy fan)  I knew it wasn't going to be the greatest films ever made but I didn't realize how bad it was going to be.  Watching the film I felt almost embarassed for the actors since they were given such crappy material.  The story line was thin and it seemed like the movie couldn't decide from whose point of view it wanted to tell the story from.  It begins and ends with a narration of the ex-boyfriend of Jennifer Episito's character but for most of the film he isn't an important character.  The direction was horrible.  It seemed they tried to make shots that were supposed to look cool but it only looked like they were covering up there low budget of a film.  There were some scenes that made me feel like I was watching an episode of Dawson Creek or Smallville because there were quite a few scenes with songs playing while showing how sad or troubled a character was.  I really wish they had cut that out because it had no point and made the movie drag out even longer than it should have.    The only good thing about the movie was the acting especially from the three female leads.  I actually thought Hannigan and Kinski had chemistry together. I would only recomend this movie to die hard Buffy fans or if you're a die hard fan of another actor in this film and then you should only rent it.  
    This book was disappointing. I had anticipated that the author would have explained what made her leave her live-in boyfriend, sell her apartment, 2 cars and shop in Switzerland to move to Kenya in pursuit of a relationship with a Masai warrior she'd barely met and with whom she did not share a common language. Her only explanation was that she was in love with "her Masai." At 27 she should have recognized the difference between animal lust and true love. (She admitted that she liked him better in only a loincloth with his hair, face and chest dyed red than she did when he was in shirt, jeans and sneakers.)    She gives few details other than an itenerary of their trips into towns to take care of business. Her most-detailed descriptions are of her episodes of vomiting and diarrhea during bouts of malaria and hepatitis. Her only mention of  the cutting rituals to inflict decorative scarring is when she's on vacation in Switzerland and the cuts become infected with scabies.    She complains of being used by others while she contantly relies on the missionary priest to fix her broken-down car.    Her complaints are those of all young women who followed a school-girl-like crush to a marriage and parenthood for which they were ill prepared. She does not adequately describe the uniqueness of her situation. I'm sure her time in Africa must have been interesting, but that's not conveyed in the book. At first I thought this was the fault of the translation, but the book only received mediocre reviews at the German Amazon site 
 This book is NOT Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates as listed.  It is Cram101 Textbook Review to accompany a textbook.  This is very false advertising and Amazon should correct the listing so that further people are not misled.  
 I don't know if I will make it through the last 50 pages of this book, it's bored me so. I was really excited to get it based on the feedback/ratings on Amazon, but it focuses so much on crime and abortion. It's far from a Rogue Economist Exploring the Hidden Side of "Everything".   I probably shouldn't rate a book that I've only read 3/4 of, but I can't see the last 1/4 being so good that it changes my mind. 
 I agree with one reviewer, in the fact that this book is just WAY too full of useless information.  80% of this book is filler.  I couldn't even weed through all of the needless information in order for this book to make an impact on me.  I was reading, and kept drifting off, because I simply didn't care about most of what he was saying.  I wanted to become a 'Great Communicator'.  Instead, I found my patience was being tested!  I don't recommend this book for anyone who doesn't want to know every little nit picking detail about certain things like the origins of language, and certain common sense things, which he explains in FULL detail.    No need for this book 
 Oh PLEASE - whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 Masterpiece Theater TV series of 'Cousin Bette' do so and make it available on DVD.   This was one of THE finest shows ever created for television.  Truly, it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now, 40+ years later, I fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to DVD.  For the sake of one of the theater (and humanity's) most glorious theatrical efforts, PLEASE make the original TV version available!  (BTW - I rate the ORIGINAL item at 5+ STARS! 
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 When Ted Dekker's on, you get a gripping yarn that'll keep you up way past your bedtime. But when he's off, you get a painful disaster like _Obsessed_.  In 1973, a young Jewish real estate proto-mogul orphaned early in life stumbles across a mysterious safe in the basement of a recently deceased Holocaust survivor, setting him on a righteous quest. Along the way he battles a sinister Nazi serial killer, unearths his mother's true identity, hangs with a group of clever flower children, pursues the mystical Stones of David (the five stones the shepherd/king used to slay Goliath), and pines for a young woman in a photograph who might be either a Holocaust victim or his future bride.  Not a bad premise for a story, but what Dekker does with the elements goes so far over-the-top it verges on camp. His increasing tendency to draw evil and good in stark black and white makes his recent villains so far-fetched as to be laughable. The villain in _Obsessed_ is not only a Nazi, he's the son of a ruthless concentration camp commandant, AND he's a serial killer, AND a Satan-worshiper. Whew! But that's not enough: Roth Braun also drinks the blood of his Jewish, female victims. It's a wonder he isn't a transvestite, too.   Nevermind that the depiction of 1970s-era Jews in _Obsessed_ is channeled from _Fiddler on the Roof_, or that the Nazi stooges resemble Rainer Wolfcastle of "The Simpsons"--every single character in this book is a stereotype, even the dog. And while all novelists go to the well of suspension of disbelief now and then, Dekker trods that path so many times in _Obsessed_ it becomes an eight lane superhighway. Simply put, the obsession that drives the story wouldn't matter to a young secular Jew bent on making a fortune in the L.A. real estate market. Factor in outlandish characters who simply drop out of the story as it progresses, laughable attempts to retrieve the object of obsession, and the oft-mined villain mistake of pontificating while the hero slips his bonds (which must happen a dozen times in this book), and readers will wonder if they're reading a parody of a Ted Dekker novel.  If it could possibly get worse, Dekker panders to the Christian audience by making the hero's mentor a Messianic Jew. What purpose this serves the story is anyone's guess since it never develops one iota. The only other nod to Christianity comes from the villain, who insists on ridiculing Jesus for no other reason than to establish that, as far as villains go, he's got an extra dollop of villainy. It's as if Dekker doesn't trust his established audience enough to forego overt references to Christianity in what is essentially a story about Jews; he's added those references to mollify the faithful rather than center the book. For a novelist as good as Ted Dekker can be, that's a sin.  Read something else by Dekker--anything. _Obsessed_ should garner only a star-and-a-half, but gets two out of the hope that it was a rush job and doesn't portend bad things for the future of Ted Dekker and those who love to read him 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation "i'm your man" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of "if it be your will" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. "If It be your will" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. "mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ." or "i am so very happy, so please hit me" or "river of sorrow, don't swallow" or the breathy way he says the word "twilight" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says "if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved "if it be your will" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort. 
 I am Persian so I know how things should taste...  In every recipe I tried one or more ingredients were missing.  This book only makes me more reliant on long distant calls to mom.  Don't waist your money.  There are many other good books 
 One-battery trimmers simply not strong enough, was glad to find a two-batteries version. It has a perfect design which will attract many more naive surfers like me. Unfortunately it's not good for nose hair trimming. Problem is it makes electric-like unpleasant sensations when touches sensitive skin inside nose. So much that it makes you scared using it ;-) It also doesn't cut well, doesn't reach inside, makes burning smell and overheated.   UPDATE On 2/7/2007:  From my recent experience, the MicroTOUCH Turbo is an excellent alternative which has no problems mentioned above. The only problem is its durability (you may find yourself buying 2 per year) but at the price below $10 this is not a real issue. Good luck 
 This books explains the very basic knowledge of available-light photography, like when and how to use a tripod. Additional information is given about how to choose and use the right (Kodak-) film for specific  situations. Thus I can recommend this book only to beginners in this field  or people with their own lab. The photographs in this book are old and not  very impressive 
 This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary 
 The skin is fine and all the extras were nice. The one thing I really needed was a good elastic band for the arm. This product does not have a good elastic band. It's too thin and not durable enough 
 Since we seem to be piling on this poor fellow, I thought this to be the most bizarre publication I have seen in years. I agree that the author is entirely too full of himself, even to the point that the purpose of the book seems to be to glorify himself, rather than to address the purported subject of the book.   Aside from that, the approach of the book seems so scatterbrained that a lot of what he says doesen't mean much unless you already know the subject matter pretty well. It's just too much of a fact here and a fact there thrown in among the author's obvious prejudices about who you will enjoy listening to and who you will not. I may not be as big a fan of the Goulding book as someone else here who has recommended it, but it is much better written, organised and filled with useful information. In fact, much of the content of the Jacobson book is so sketchy that it will make a lot more sense if you read something like Goulding first.   On the other hand, if you have already read Goulding or the like, you probably don't need this book anyway, unless you just like to hear authors talk of themselves. 
 A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.   In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?  Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books 
 There is no real reason to read this book, it is monotinous life on the old prarie. Only without the excitment of actually living it. You have to sit through and suffer page after page as he describes how flat the prarie  is. Go outside and look at your lawn! Wow that was more exciting then  hearing Mari describe dirt for five pages! For your own sake don't buy this  book. Give the money to some starving children in Rwanda instead 
 My Iraq-bound son shelled out his hard-earned cash to buy this as a book-on-CD for us to "enjoy" on the ride home when we visited him prior to his deployment.I wish there was a way to get his money back!  "R is for Ricochet", is a truly abysmal addition to the alphabet series. I realize that some of my criticism might have more to do with the delivery by Judy Kaye ... but after reading many of the other reviews, I doubt it.   If you think that endless filler (think high school student with a 3,000 word essay to write) is tedious while reading it ... try having it read aloud to you. *groan* I can't tell you how many times we made the hands rolling "GET ON WITH IT!" motion.  What on earth happened to the feisty, risk-taking, down-to-earth, no-frills, take-it-on-the-chin heroine we know and grew to love? Kinsey Millhone is utterly unrecognizable in this story. Here, she is wimpy, gullible, tentative, and full of teenage angst, a regular worrywart. In fact, she is downright stupid in many scenes.  Her alleged "friendship" with the ex-con Reba, was laughably contrived. They have zero in common and Kinsey is ten years her senior. Reba was a totally unbelievable character ... one minute a train wreck, the next ... brilliant star detective.   As for Kinsey's new romance ... oh puh-leeze! Sue Grafton was so obviously trying to imitate Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli. Why on earth would clothing-challenged Kinsey fall for a snappy Italian dresser in expensive designer clothes? So NOT her type. How would she even recognize these designer clothes for what they are? The Kinsey I know would have commented that the guy looked "good", period! And don't even get me started on the girlie clothes shopping scene. Kinsey ... you used to have a backbone, what happened?  Finally, I totally concur with those who wondered where on earth the title "R is for Ricochet" fitted in!? A cut-and-paste "mystery" that Sue Grafton should have been ashamed to put her name on.  Skip this one for sure ... I was so disappointed with "R is for Ricochet" I doubt I will ever pick up another Grafton 
 Crap.  I thought their first three records were amazing and totally different from anything I've ever heard.  V was kind of weak. VI is one my favorites. VII is a pretty good record. VIII is okay. IX - their 1st greatest hits album is a okay if you just want the hits.  X is the beginning of a string 13 crapy records in a row. 
 Enough, enough, ENOUGH already with the Ray Ray. I'm not really sure why this book exists other than to milk the RR cash cow. Her 30 Minute Meal books are getting repetitive, and this looks like it was dashed off in a couple of weeks.   I feel bad for the businesses where RR says what she ordered was "not her favorite" or something similar. What a snot. I'd be PISSED if I owned the Crack'd Conch. I think she's forgetting how lucky she is to be doing what she's doing.   Bottom line, if you're as agog with RR's cuteness as she is, pick the book up. Lots of pics! 
 I had read the author's second book, Pink Slip, first and loved it, so I eagerly anticipated this novel.  I thought it was terrible.  In my opinion, none of the characters had any good qualities. paticularly Rosa and Gary.   By the time I got through the book I didn't care what happened to them.   Ms. Ciresi has a knack for writing about the most gross of bodily functions  ad nauseum.  Thank goodness Pink Slip was an improvement over this book,  and that I read this one after it.  I would not recommend this book 
 Sean Hannity's rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country, especially when their audience consists of like-minded organ banks.  Hannity is stupid, hypocritical and loud.  His sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon-oxygen exchange.  Hannity is well-coiffed, well dressed  and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the Hannity and Combs report.  This bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt 2 sizes too small.  Get a real job, you poser 
 When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey. 
 I'm taking a precalc class that uses this text as a refresher before beginning an undergraduate degree in Physics. In the early 90' I'd taken Algebra, Statistics, Precalc, and even a few Calculus classes (over 10 math classes in all). Out of all the math texts I've used, this is by far the worst. The examples are so poorly explained, I ALWAYS end up having to refer to one of my old texts. The book was written to be used with TI calculators, only problem is, no key stokes on how to perform a particular operation are included. Normally this should be the realm of your trusty owners manual, but if a math text is geared for a particular brand of calculator and the faculty at your college are forcing that brand of calculator down the students throats, then the book should offer some instruction on the calculator. I'm actually thinking about finishing my math at another college that does NOT use this text. If you're just looking for a reference book for precalc, look elsewhere 
 I just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece's meeting with Sean. But first, the review.  In order not to diminish the previous reviews, I will just focus on the whole war talk. On page 4--no messing around here--Sean states, "[w]e must take the war to them, rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood." Wow, bring it on dude. Oh, you mean let's send somebody else's kid to fight, right? On page 247 he drills that point in with, "[i]'d like to see the good governor [Dean] present a case that there's any higher moral cause than defending one's innocent countrymen against terrorist attack." If it's such a great "moral cause," Sean, why oh why ain't you out there with the rest of my family? Does this, by the way, mean you are immoral since you punked out? I never thought of myself as "moral" just because I volunteered and served as a paratrooper in Vietnam. Is military service only for Democrats and brown people? Should we have a new draft catagory such as "1R" for "Republican," which means you don't have to serve?  To paraphrase Frank Purdue, it takes a tender man to spout tough talk. Page 108 puts down Democrats (I'm a Democrat who served in Vietnam, or am I repeating myself?) with, "[w]hen it comes to the Hitlers, the Brezhnevs, the Saddams, pussyfooting is the order of the day." Yeah, Sean, tell me what you really think. Well, Sean, some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you...do....what? And wasn't the Bush family in business with Hitler during WWII?  Here is really why this guy is full of himself. My niece, visiting me before heading to the Gulf and her first combat tour, spotted him in DC. She introduced herself and told him she was a fan. When she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book, saying he would ship it to her. She is very polite, and told him he didn't have to. Sean insisted. She wrote her address down. Before heading overseas, I asked her if Sean had sent the book as promised. No (and no surprise for me). So, me being me, I contacted Sean by email twice but got not reply. Too busy impressing all those other servicewomen, I guess.  Sean Hannity, not just by this book but by his actions, is a coward, blowhard, and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen. His book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book. You should be ashamed of yourself, Sean, but that would mean taking a "moral" position, wouldn't it?  
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 I picked up this O'Conner book because every once in awhile I hear about her being "the definitive voice of the South" or "very disturbing" - I like disturbing and since I'm not overly familiar with the South, the definitive voice of it seems a good place to start.  But I just couldn't do it.  I read maybe 4 stories before I had to put it down for good.  I found the characterizations sophomoric and, well -- I suspect the overt, unsubtle, judgemental observations constantly being offered were snide parody, read in this day of self-consciousness they read like pandering to the lowest common denominator.  Timely, maybe.  Timeless, it's not 
 This is the worst season ever!  Nick, Natalie and the entire original cast have seen much better days in seasons 1 & 2.   SPOILERS.... . . . . . . . . First, Schanke gets killed off in the first episode.  Then, Janette is absent for the entire season, except for one episode and when she does return, she's not the Janette we know and love!  Thirdly, Vachon---what a sorry excuse for a vampire.  Fourth, the new captain is a JOKE.  Fifth they didn't know what they wanted to do with Lacroix and lastly Tracy Vetter...yuk!!  Trust me---don't waste your money on this one 
 It is true, the pages fall out faster than you can use them. And the puzzles are not jumble like in a real game. For example, in a real game no one stops to tell you, "ok look for an X-ray Attack"... and so the book is not helpful. Instead, I recommend- "Sharpen Your Tactics 
 A major shortcoming of Bazerman and Watkins' book is the failure to provide adequate evidence to support their arguments about what they call "predictable surprises", which they define as "an event or series of events that take an individual or group by surprise, despite prior awareness of all of the information necessary to anticipate the events and their consequences." Bazerman and Watkins build their case substantially on just two examples: aviation security failures leading to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and auditor independence concerns leading to the collapse of Enron and Arthur Anderson. Several other examples are discussed in less depth throughout the text, however many of these are not actually predictable surprises under the definition provided. For example, global warming is discussed a number of times; however global warming has been in public discussion since the 1930s, and today a substantial majority of people believe not only the concept of global warming but that current warming is man-made. By 2050, this subject will have been under study for 120 years and popular consensus will have been achieved for 50-60 years. This is certainly predictable, but hardly a surprise. The United States' looming crisis in entitlement spending also falls in this category.  Flaws exist in other anecdotal support as well. For example, Bazerman and Watkins cite aviation security failures as an occasion when overly discounting the future lead to a predictable surprise. Quick calculation based on figures provided in the book show that, using equal discount rates for the expected future cost of security and the future cost of disaster, even with a disaster probability as high as 10% for any given year, the airlines would be ahead on a cost basis. The total destruction of both World Trade Center towers and the massive ensuing death toll was not reasonably foreseeable by the airline industry; based on the typical passenger plan carrying 78 people, this was the equivalent of an absurd 41 simultaneous aircraft disasters! Given the cost of implementation and the low probability of such a large disaster, even at a full cost of nearly $50 billion, the airlines' decision to oppose security measures on a cost basis was reasonable. The full scope of this surprise was unlikely enough that it should not be termed "predictable."  Despite some good analysis of reasons predictable surprises occur and ways to avoid them, this book is critically weakened by its lack of evidence. Bazerman and Watkins try to make it stand largely on just the aviation security and auditor independence failures; however these are insufficient evidence for their broad analysis and conclusions, particularly given the weakness of those arguments provided. This book would be substantially more persuasive with more anecdotal support 
 This is a valiant effort but the author concentrates way too much on contemporary music and "trendy" scene bands; it's as though she never listened to anything that came out before 1980.  A far better bet is "Music Lust" by Nic Harcourt, which is basically the same concept but written by a professional music journalist and KCRW radio DJ, which gives much better lists of songs and artists 
 I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large "snags" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr 
 There are many mistakes in this book in many of the mechanisms. Many of the mechanisms are not completely drawn out and are missing many arrows and non-bonded/lone pair electrons. Compared to other O.Chem. textbooks that I have read, this one does not flow in a manner that is very easy to follow and the frequent mistakes make it even more difficult. I would not recommend this book to any professor or student taking O.Chem. 
 After doing a bunch of research, I bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective Sony CCD that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had.  The first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations.  After a few days of that, the camera dies completely.  The second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease.  One camera . . . a fluke maybe.  But two?  That suggests a real problem so beware. 
 I never got this book and I have tried numerous time to get my money back and I have only gotten the runaround. Why wont you respond to the fact that I never got this book and is anything going to be done about it. 
 I just listened to "The Bogus Man" twice. What a piece of garbage -- and nearly 10 minutes long. If this is any indication of the rest of the album, then stay away 
 Geeze this DVD sucks, maybe if you smoke your socks before you watch it your mind will wander to a more interesting place 
 Whilst I do like Jessica and Nick, (I was a fan of Jessica since "I'm gonna love you forever" and I always liked 98degrees), this is embarrasing.    On Newlyweds, I think she's actually funny.  I love the show and I don't see the negatives that people talk about.  This however was different.  I can't beleive they need the money, so Jessica and Nick - DON"T DO THIS AGAIN.  I couldn't believe they did such stupid rubbish and kept a straight face.  It's fine to do songs along with other famous singers, but don't sing with a car, and don't do pole-vaulting across the stage and then act high at other times.    Yes there are some good moments in this, but overall,?  I was cringing considerably 
 If you can use the internet,and more specifically a search engine,theres nothing in this book helpful.Find a few good resellers online,ones with reveiws and product links,and you not only get quick knowledge but save alot of time and money 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 A normal Tour of Duty lasts 1 year. For Kerry, it only lasted 4 months. And in those four months, Kerry collected a record three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars and a Bronz Star? C'mon! If this were legitimate, Kerry would be a bigger hero than Audie Murphy!  I know it's old news now. This book was intended to be and was a political tool to help Kerry become president in 2004. Kerry lost decisively. It's over. But for Kerry to say that he did all of these things is absolute nonsense. For Douglas Brinkley to claim this as  history as like a movie producer claiming a fiction movie of a action hero (perhaps played by Chuck Norris) is history and reality too! C'mon! And there are still people giving this book five stars?   PT Barnum would be proud of the efforts of Kerry and Douglas Brinkley.   HURRY, HURRY, HURRY. COME SEE THE COMMUNIST TRAITOR JOHN KERRY WHO FINKED ONHIS COUNTRY AND HIS COMRADES. HURRY, HURRY, HURRY. COME READ ABOUT THE MYTH OF KERRY'S HEROISM ALL FABRICATED BY KERRY AND ENDORSED BY DOUGLAS BRINKLEY 
 Its an interesting read, but far from scholarly, and I certainly would never use it as a reference in a scholarly discussion. However, the humor makes it worth the price. But back to criticism...  One of the frequent quotes cited from Harwood is on the physical appearance of a historical Jesus. He paraphrases an impossible to verify 'work' of Josephus. But even the Testimonium Flavianum, which is another Josephus passage of far more credibility has proven itself an unlikely source of extra-biblical Christian evidence, and probably a pious interpolation. Yet in Harwood's mind this and far less compelling conjecture is good as gold. I'd recommend the interested reader find a decent translation of the meagre texts drawn upon by scholars and would-be scholars and make their own judgement. Still, unless some great archaeological discovery is made in the future, there's very little to be added to Abrahamic scholarship that isn't composed as simple polemic. 
 I though the blu-ray was very good but I found the movie predictable and very boring. I bought it because of the raves of the HD quality and it is very good in that respect. I hate the movie itself though. 
 A great story, but not very well told 
 Sony Disc player does not work. It won't recognize disc in player.  Currently trying to get it serviced under warranty 
 "Classic" implies a degree of excellence.  Instead, this book is merely a compilation of movies from the silents through the 50's without regard to merit---from bomb to 4 star.  I bought this thinking it was devoted to truly good movies from silents to the present with the turkeys weeded out.  It isn't and you would probably be better served to just buy the regular annual guide 
 What a disappointment.  The spinner just can't gain enough speed to do anything lilke what it is supposed to do.  Overall, it's  a cheap item with limited supplies for the $ 
 I had to go through five disks in order to write two recovery disks for my PC.  At this rate, I might get 20 good disks out of the 50 
 Another greatest hits debacle.  For the most part, this is their best stuff but where's Mistral Wind?  It was a favorite of the band, fans and radio.  
 Even though I own most of the "Poirot Offerings" starring David Suchet owing to my affinity for Agatha Christie's work,I still maintain that "Peter Ustinov" is by far more at home in "Poirot's" shoes as evident by his inimitable performences as the belgian eccentric/sleuth over the years.particularly in the "Death on the Nile"(1978).And having said that, the latest addition to A&E's Poirot caper of the same name featuring Suchet is unfortunately "Toothles and Meandering" at best.In short,If you already own the Original ( Ustinov )version,then don't even bother spending your hard-earned on this trite 
 This peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy Skippy.  A lack of flavor and dry texture makes me wonder if by "palm oil" they meant to write "socks".  Thoroughly disappointing, I only finished the one jar I bought because peanut butter is a staple in my diet and I wasn't about to waste it.  Buy the real all natural peanut butters or even the cheap store brand which contains Fully Hydrogenated oils which are fine for you unlike Partially Hydrogenated ones 
 This is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to read: academic writing style, feeble plot, very forced. There is no humour or humanity in this book. A complete waste of a good tree 
 i'm a nora roberts fan, so picking up a book of hers to read is something i look forward to. after reading "born in fire", i was eager to find out what kind of romance the cool and collected brianna would find in "born in ice".  brianna is a young woman who is uncomfortable with conflict, and because she grew up in a household where her fiery sister maggie and embittered mom maeve were always battling, she developed the ability to keep a calm facade in the face of a storm. she has done a good job of disciplining her emotions to the point where they can't create further conflict, even if she burns with anger inside. she's very family oriented and longs for a husband and family of her own. after being jilted weeks before her wedding a decade before the timing of the story, she thinks she'll never have what she dreams of.  she owns a bed and breakfast in a small town in ireland where she is the perfect hostess. she's always hospitable to her guests. she's a gifted artist in both the kitchen and garden, two places she loves to be. although she's surrounded by folks who love her, she's still lonely.  and then comes grayson, the american writer who pops in for a couple of months to write a novel as inspired by the scenery and ambience of ireland. he's one who lives in the moment, ignoring his past and unwilling to plan the future because of the commitment and responsibilities such an action would create.  the characters compliment each other well. they're both generous and both suffering from childhoods where they didn't feel loved. she's comfortable with the idea of laying down roots but he's not. that's where the conflict comes to play.   and that's kinda where i've got a problem with the book. this is supposed to be a guy who doesn't want emotional ties, yet early in the book he's already willingly becoming emotionally attached to her. there simply wasn't enough resistance from him for me to believe he was really afraid of settling down. there was very little if any sexual tension here, and not enough situations to warrant sexual tension. a couple of encounters of kissing and then they were in bed. and even then, it seemed like he wasn't really fighting himself for being there. there simply wasn't enough of an inner conflict within him. it all seemed like lukewarm resistance.  and brianna was simply a saint. i would have liked to see her emote a little more. i understand that she was written to be an ice princess of sorts, but i don't think roberts did a good job of depicting her as a character who was a carefully contained boiler. at times i found it difficult to believe brianna could exhibit any kind of real passion with grayson.   there were alot of slow moments in the book that made me wishing i was already near the end. i will say that the ending was sweet. also, it was great seeing how the relationship of maggie and rogan progressed from "born in fire".  i'd recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the vividness of a writer's imagination, as roberts did a great job with grayson in that respect. however, if you're looking for a "can't put down" romance novel, this ain't it 
 I was forced to endure this film when it first appeared in theatres ("Dude, you've gotta see it, it's great!", and "Man, we laughed our axxes off!"  were some of the comments I heard from friends.)  So I went, and in spite of being "tuned up" with some pretty ace left-handed tobaccy, I failed to laugh even once. Mindless, infantile, plotless, talentless, stupid, the list goes on and on.  Hell, there isn't even any good nudity in it.  Colossal waste of time 
 Have read several Leonard books and this may be the worst one I have read. The two so called "bad men" remind me of my self if I tried to do what they did. NOTHING goes right. Ordell Robbie and Louis Gara grab Mickey Dawson, wife of Frank Dawson, to hold for ransom. Frank could care less. He has a mistress and does not want his wife back. This makes Mickey very upset and she decides she wants part of the action with Ordell and Louis. Meanwhile, the mistress decides she wants to be part of their plan too. You will meet crazy Richard, who likes to shoot people. There was page after page of just talk. Nothing happening. I kept thinking it would get better but no such luck. If you are having trouble sleeping try this book 
 I like some of her other books, but this one turned me off. In our house, Mommy and Daddy both know how to use tools. Is tools, sports, and beer (when they're older :) the only way for males to bond? I don't think so 
 I highly recommend this item as a study in rhetoric and denial of science.  Mr. Bethell was recently on Book TV discussing his book and was truly entertaining 
 Though "I Swear" is a great song, this group will go down in history as All-4-One hit wonder 
 I did not like this book what-so-ever.  I didn't care for any of receipes because has it has already been stated, they are not user, family friendly for those with a lifestyle that includes cub scout meetings and baseball games.  The entries regarding her financial lifestyle certainly didn't help either. If you want to read this book either pre or post op I would suggest borrowing a copy, not purchasing.  However I will give the author a point for stressing the importance of protein.  
 My daughter was thrilled to get this for christmas with the rest of the set for the Little mommy doll.It came out of the box with easy basic instructions to put it together.BUT once it was put together my daughter went to put her doll in and it fell apart.Not the whole thing but the arm that holds the swing onto the base keeps falling off.My friends does the same nthing. Very cheaply made.Was not impressed at all. 
 I read this book as part of a Contemporary World Literature course I took in college, and I thought it was the worst book I have ever read.  The book is supposed to be about a white woman in South Africa whose father is in prison because of his anti-apartheid views.  The strange thing is I learned NOTHING about South Africa, living conditions for whites and blacks in South Africa, and the effect that apartheid had on people in living in South Africa.  This book was written in a hoity-toity, avant garde, stream of conciousness fashion that it was impossible to know what was going on.  I found myself counting the number of pages until I finished the book.  The author of this book should seriously consider writing a book that is coherent, informs people, and broadens their horizon of knowledge, which this book certainly does NOT do 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 BBC Oct 2005: Reggae star faces assault trial Reggae star Buju Banton is to go on trial next month in Jamaica for his alleged role in an attack on a group of six gay men, a judge said on Friday. Banton, 31, and another man, Horace Hill, are accused of beating the men at a house in Jamaica, in June 2004. Both men have pleaded not guilty. The trial is due to begin on 19 October. Last year Banton and other dancehall acts had to cancel concerts in Europe and the US after protests by gay groups over their allegedly homophobic lyrics. Banton was banned from playing in Manchester last September after complaints about the contents of his lyrics. In June 2004, a concert in Hackney by fellow dancehall star Beenie Man was cancelled after similar complaints were made.  Cool beats if he and Beenie Man weren't so insecure ; ) Jah knows LOL, people hate about others what they dislike about themselves.. 
 So many people have written glowing things about this book, but I don't know why.  I think that I am becoming too practical and logical as I mature, so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness.  I think that the writing was well-done, but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value.   Either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel.  I didn't see why I should ever want to read it again, or have read it at all.  It is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers, so they looked all pretty and still alive, but still, the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer.    About the only thing I got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence.  I assume that I am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer, but still thought it was rather a waste of my time.  
 Rants from a socialist in denial.  Only thinly veiled lies, half-truths and distortions, packaged as documentary.  I'd only pick this up if I ran out of toilet paper.  After I rented Bowling for Columbine I returned it to the store.  They gave me my money back for the rental but if they had given me twice the rent price back I'd still feel ripped off 
 If you are thinking of leaving an abusive spouse, this book may help you. The latter section, "Dealing With," is a short 'book report' based on a few sources. It doesn't read well, and it doesn't present much information. The first section, 'Identify,' wastes a lot of paper, presenting one idea on each page. It is reminiscent of "you know you're a redneck if...". Many are redundant; the last several are lame. There is a solid use for this information, but I believe it was presented poorly. The title is also misleading. "Toxic People" is too broad a category. These are ways to identify Abusers: those who are either (or both) physically and mentally abusive of others. I'm sure it will help some people, but it wasn't what I was looking for at all 
 I enjoyed ric's other book "The truth about money", and decided to purchase this book as well.  Firstly, for someone who is looking for a tactical plan and something i can excute upon, this books provides very little help.  Only the last few chapter provided some relevant information, the rest of the book was focusing on the inspire readers to invest, not exactly what i looking for.  Secondly, a lot of the information is a rehash of the truth about money.  I do like ric like a financial advisor, but wouldn't recommend this boo 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 I deleted my first review for this album because I realized later it was unfair. I'm trying to turn a new leaf. I want to express my opinions, but to express them with a little less venom and a little more respect.  I think Nas is a great rapper, and contrary to what Jay-Z says, Nas is probably the greatest rapper alive. However, I do take issue with some things he harps on in his music. I applaud the love Nas seems to have for black women (that is when he's not calling us bitches, but I guess it depends on how you want to take it); but he seems to have a problem with blacks who don't fit his design on what blackness should be. And this is what I have a problem with; especially with his lyrics on the Street's Disciple cd. What does he mean by the "cooning" and "UPN and WB" thing? Is he insulting the black actors on those networks because of their comedy? My definition of "cooning" is degrading or embarrassing yourself for the sole purpose of appealing to a particular group. You could look at anything blacks do today as "cooning": especially blacks who are falsely acting like thugs or tramps to appeal to the buying public which is predominately white.  What about his comments about Condi Rice? Is she not a real black woman just because she's a Republican? Is she an Uncle Tom? Well, my definition of an Uncle Tom is a black person who sells out their own for the advantage of another. Can't black men and women selling drugs to their own and subsequently having a role in the destruction of their neighborhoods be an example of Uncle Tom behavior? Doesn't that mean 90% of today's rappers, including Nas, apply?   Our skin color makes us black, not our attitudes, behavior, or even political views. He doesn't seem to understand that. He tries to define blackness. Now what if white people tried to define blackness for us? Would we tolerate that? So why do we have a right to define it for others?   I'm not against interracial dating, but as a black woman I certainly understand the frustration with the "trend" of black men disproportionately choosing other races for companionship than other men of other races. But there is a difference between solely dating a certain race because you find disfavor with your own, and just happening to find a person of another race attractive. Does Nas discern the difference or is he against dating whites altogether? Well you see, I don't know what he feels, only what he says in his music. That's the only source I have to judge his mentality. And his mentality seems to need a little work with its open-mindedness, or lack thereof. 
 Cynical AND boring - quite a combination!  Quick question:  you are interested in power, male-female relationships and female friendships in the Big Apple.  Yet somehow, work gets screwed up, relationships go badly and you end up lamenting the sad state of affairs loudly and often in print to your female friends.  Do you:  a) realize that "insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results" and get therapy or find comfort in family or religion?  or   b) write a tedious, boring book about how hard successful women have it, in which the same few complaints are recycled over and over and over and over.......    this author is too cynical for me, and her penchant for irritating characters who repeat themselves endlessly is bothersome.  I don't recommend this except to those not bothered by a quite cynical POV 
 I've used Omnipage 12 and 14 and got the latest version to convert an out of print book to a text pdf.  Nothing really fancy, two column text mostly w pictures and captions plus 3 tables. Using this software was a nightmare.  The OCR worked better than the previous version BUT it showed mixed fonts on the page (two column text w a title about 1/3 down and above the text).  No problem I thought, I'll just use the wysiwyg (what you see if what you get) text editor to fix this..it looks very nice w some good features.  Well, wysiyg is more like wysiwyDON'Tget.  I'd fix the fonts, save the file, open it in adobe reader and find that Omnipage had made some startling changes in the fonts/size and the titles.  I tried for 3 hrs to get a simple table of contents page w just a title and 8 lines (each w text followed by a page number)...no go.  Plus the wysiwyg editor would sometimes inexplicably throw me into 'replace text' mode while I was trying to insert text and I couldn't get out.  In frustration I used a friends machine w Abby Finereader 7.0 Pro...what a welcome change.  OCR was at least as fast and accurate and the editor, while not as feature laden as Omnipages, actually worked!  I did in 6 hrs what I'd been trying for well over 12 to do in Omnipage..and that was w/o going thru any of the tutorial info..just loaded it and started.  I'm buying Abby for my next project, they've upgraded to 8.0 and I'll bet it's editor delivers what Omnipage only promises.  I wouldn't recommend Omnipage 15 Pro to anyone 
 Most of the songs chosen were not major house records in terms of popularity or sales and did not gather any underground following 
 Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award.  Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.  Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums 
 This is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author.  The book is poorly researched, poorly written and, well, words just fail me.  While I am not a great Herriot fan, I do have to give him his due - the man could write well and could tell a good story (isn't that what authors are suppose to do?) but this guy Graham Lord, I suspect, has problems feeding paper into his typewriter!  The intire book is such an obvious ploy to make some money on the shirttail of a "dead" and popular author, it is rather nauseating.  Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work!  I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could not stop, thinking with each turn of the page "well it just cannot be any worse than that last page/chapter."  How wrong I was!  If you must read the thing, borrow it or check it out of a library.  I would hate to see a person waste their money, and I certainly would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this.  Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating subject.  I do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually.  We certainly did not get it here 
 This book is appalling. It is disempowering to women, providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births (with no reference to back it up), and generally gives a "don't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you" attitude--even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby.   In spite of what this book says, there are things you can do to minimize tearing (and episiotomies don't heal better than tears, in spite of what the book says), things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions, and so on. Of course there are times these things are needed, but not nearly so often as the book suggests, and it's not nearly so random. It continually cites opinions as facts, without any evidence base.  There are much, much better books out there than this one. Don't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book 
 The fact that the author used electric shocks to torment dogs in order to do his research turns me off to his work completely. Perhaps he should study about "learned compassion" before telling us about "learned helplessness." How could one be happy - authentically or otherwise - when such cruel research was conducted to get to his opinions. Surely, in this day and age, and among civilized people, there was another way to form his conclusions... a way that did not include torturing dogs to get test results. Shame on you Dr 
 Given his eye for detail, obviously thorough research, ability to write reasonably well, and obvious commitment as a devout Catholic, this book should be a good read. It isn't. Instead, it is an unfocused mess. It even has digressions that repeat themselves without any intervening material. Did this writer never pass his work beneath the eyes of an editor? If he did, was that editor someone for whom English was a second language? Given the great problems with this book, how does it rise so far in the book distribution world? It's as if a gifted High School student, mentored by a teacher so bemused by the fact that his student knows the difference between a sentence and a paragraph that he fails to notice his student's lack of compositional organization, has suddenly had his second-semester term paper marketed by a bunch of grownups who should know better. It seems to be a trend in the publishing world, but it doesn't change anything: this book does not even rise to the designation of second rate. I am sorry about that, too, because I want to like this book and this author and to buy the other members of the Trilogy. But I cannot. This book is just not worth the money

 WHAT A LOUSY MOVIE! AND I READ NOTHING BUT GLOWING REVIEWS ABOUT THIS CONVOLUTED PIECE OF BAD ACTING, BAD STORIED MOVIE. PLEASSSEEE, SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A BAD MOVIE, BORING AND ALL-AND-ALL A LOUSY STORY. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT 
 I loved this when it came out, but I also loved lots of things then that weren't good for me. Not that this is harmful in any way... it's just that it is really, really awful.  Lemmy is the only one in the band that could play with any facility or sense of melody, and even he wasn't exactly at his best then. The drummer is an unsteady, two-lick metronome, and Dave Brock continuously uses a wah pedal on his guitar solos to try to cover up for the fact that he sounds like he's playing with his toes. Overlay it all with undifferentiated sonic sludge, add a flute/reed player who seems to have never learned half the notes on either instrument, and sprinkle with "cosmic" lyrics that weren't so much goofy as stupid - that was Hawkwind.   Don't buy the hype. Hawkwind was always terrible, if terribly sincere. They were a joke then, and if you pay what they're asking for this idiocy, the joke's on you. Want space rock? Buy Gong, or even Planet Gong, not this mud 
 I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed. 
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
  If you want to know the truth about the time and people portrayed in this book try reading Lost Astronaut or one of dozens of other books written by the astronauts and the people closest to them at the time. There are many many excellent books. I have had the pleasure to read most of them. THIS IS A MOVIE at best and a LIE at worst. I hope Tom made lots of money.   
 When my doctor diagnosed my hypothyroidism, my wife bought me this and another book on thyroid disease to help me understand what was happening to me. The authors write with an annoying lack of humility -- the text seemed to be as much about these doctors' superior knowledge as about thyroid disease itself. I was put off by this arrogant tone and did not finish the book. The other book, _The Thyroid Solution_ by Ridha Arem, is a much better choice 
 In reading Six Black Presidents: Black Blood : White Masks USA I was struck by the need of the author to acquire the men that are reviewed in the book. These men are people, they are not posessions, however I felt distinctly that I was being asked to give someone away for the purposes of supporting the theories put forth in this work.    While the content is compelling, if true, the lack of primary evidence and fact overshadows this work.    As another reviewer has pointed out, there is a heavy reliance on phrases such as "It is thought..." and "It is believed..."  Qualifying key sentences with these pharses detracts from the reliability of the material as fact.  There also seems to be a reliance on "Post Hoc Ergo Promptor Hoc" (Therefore, because of this) reasoning, which while persuasive, is faulty.  Structurally, the writing style of the author develops a cadance, seldom stumbling, but often bringing this reader to reread portion of the book to see if the mind was carried past a detail that would add clarity to the argument.  While not a bad example of theory, however, the author fails to sell the reader on the premise that these men have enough identifiers to clearly identify them as being Afro-Centric in the ancestry, or in their thoughts. 
 The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.  Drop ya boots, dawg!!! I 
 The record shows Archie Manning, the  Elder of his unfortunate football family was the worst QB in Pro Football  history! His 28-72-1 record and losing (not winning) % is the worst in NFL hi- story. Not that this family is disfunction- al or anything. Peyton Manning is one of the better push-button NFL QBs today, if only he calls his plays once in a while. But he still is horrid in the playoffs. True, no QB got to 33,000+ yds., faster in Pro Football history (that includes the better CFL). Good 'ole Archie Mann- ing was one of the most loved by the  Football Establishment who made all  sorts of excuses why the Saints couldn't  win and Manning is the main reason! Back- up Bobby Scott, who later fizzles in Pro season number 12 in the USFL, was better, as evidenced by his 10-9-1 record. In  fact when he left (then Coach) O.A. 'Bum' Phillips Saints (Dec. 1982) he was the winningest QB in Saints history (%wise)! Don't give me any of that bull about the Saints not having the talent to win! They had superb RBs like Chuck Muncie, Tony Gal- braith, DBs like Tommy Myers, Terry Schmidt, Johnny Fuller, OLm Emanual Z-Man Zanders (not the lead singer for Cheap Trick!). Manning was so horrid one of the first thing Phillips did upon coming aboard with (then) John Mecom's Saints was to get rid of Archie and Viola! The Saints started winning! Ditto for Eli of the New York Football Giants, the worst Pro starting QB since, well...Archie! And how about the piece of work Olivia his mom? She tells him to not play in San Diego! Oh, great food, good weather, but don't go there! Good instead to a nuclear swamp waste like the New Jersey Meadowlands where poor Bobby Scott had to go to! Archie and Eli are made for each other. And will Peyton ever win an AFC Championship let alone a Super Bowl? As they say in 'Joisee' - Fahgedaboutdit!!!!!! 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 Okay, the first SLEEPAWAY CAMP was a nice little Horror flick.  It came out during a time when Slasher movies were becoming popular (FRIDAY THE 13th), so SLEEPAWAY CAMP didn't try to hide the fact it was pretty much a "copy cat."  The plot is much different compared to FRIDAY THE 13th but it still has the whole Summer camp theme.  Anyways, it spawned a pretty good sequel, which went the "Horror Comedy" rout that was popular in the mid 1980's Horror scene.  The sequel wasn't nearly as enjoyable as the first but at least it felt like an honest movie, unlike this tired mess TEENAGE WASTELAND.  When I was younger, I watched this movie and couldn't help but feel like the movie cheated me.  Most of the gory scenes seemed lacking and alot of the deaths were done off camera.  Needless to say, I was pretty dissapointed because I enjoyed the other two films so much.  Later on down the road (when I was much older) I decided to watch the movie again and then learn about it's production afterwords.  As it turns out, TEENAGE WASTELAND came out during a time when the MPAA was coming down on the Horror movie business with an iron fist!  Most Horror movies that came out during the late 80's were seriously edited and most of the footage was either scrapped or lost over the years.  Now, if you buy the SLEEPAWAY CAMP box set you can see all the scrapped scenes the MPAA thought was too "over the top" for (shockingly enough) a Horror movie!  After watching all the bloody and gory scenes they cut out (believe me, they're really nasty!), I am at the conclusion that TEENAGE WASTELAND would have been a much better movie with them left in it.  Sadly, you can't watch these scenes in the actual movie.  Only through the deleted scenes on the "extras" part of the DVD.  Thank goodness Horror movies today (when out on DVD) come with the option to buy the rated or unrated versions.  That way, the footage isn't lost and the movie is seen the way it was ment to be viewed.  The actual movie SLEEPAWAY CAMP 3 - TEENAGE WASTELAND isn't anything amazing.  Basically it's about the psychotic chick/dude from the first two movies coming back to Sleepaway Camp.  It would seem that she can't get enough of killing people just because they sin or whatever.  Anyways, the series isn't anywhere near the wonders of NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or HELLRAISER.  It's basically just a cheap excuse to put a bunch of hot teenagers in the same camp, kill them off in horrible ways (there is a funny scene where this one guy gets a fire cracker shoved up his nose) and then roll the credits.  I don't personally have anything against Slasher movies such as that but when the MPAA sticks it's big ugly nose in and edits things for the sake of "America's youth" or whatever, things start to go down hill.  So on an end note, TEENAGE WASTELAND could have been enjoyable but ends up being a dud, thanks mainly to the MPAA.  Gore houngs might want to pick up a DVD copy just to see the edited scenes.  Everyone else won't know whats going on, won't really care whats going on and won't remember what the movie was about.  If you think your one of those type of people, ignore this movie and move on to something else.  Come to think of it, what are you doing reading my review!?!        
 Note that this product includes only the AC adapter but no additonal cabling to attach to the Zune.  So if you were thinking about having one cable to hook to your PC and another to charge if you are away from you PC, remember to take the Zune cable with you. For $29.95 I expected them to include the 25 cent cable 
 The third book of the Bourne trilogy just does not stand up to "The Bourne Identity." He lost his character!  He never comes close to bringing Jason to life, and making him real,and yet,larger than life, like he was in "The Bourne Identity."   This book calls to my mind the question of who really wrote it.  I get the same feeling from Tom Clancy's later works; they do not ring of the author's metal  There are so many mistakes in this work,and it is so cluttered-up with half explanations, and under developed situations and characters,that it would hardly rate a C- in any college creative writing class.    I was very hard-pressed to complete the read,very sorry to say. It is about twice the length it should be,given all the flaws,requiring the reader to really work hard to finish. 
 This book started well, but fell flat in the middle. What little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through. Even the shooting incident couldn't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly.  Well, I didn't bother to finish it--I have limited time for reading, and I don't like to waste it.  
 I have been studying Abraham Lincoln for nearly 40 years.  Burlingame is inaccurate in many of his statements about Lincoln and Mary Lincoln in particular and does not present all of the information about both of them.  Possibly his most faulty act is using William Herndon's information about Lincoln and Mary Lincoln.  Herndon and Mary Lincoln hated each other.  After Lincoln passed away, Herndon may have very well said things about Lincoln and her to hurt, degrade and disgrace Mary Lincoln.  Herndon is NOT to be trusted to be accurate much of the time.  Other very poor Lincoln authors are Weik, Sandburg, Gore Vidal, Lerone Bennett, Jr., Thomas DiLorenzo, Vincent Harding and Barbara Fields.  Their accuracy, interpretations and images are usually wrong and at times even bizarre.  If you want to read professionally researched, much more accurate material about Lincoln, read books by David Herbert Donald, Stephen Oates, Frank Williams, Mark Neely, Jr., Edward Steers, Jr. and Allen Guelzo 
 After struggling throught the first 6 chapters of this book I put it down, went to the library and checks out other books. While this book may be great in a classroom situation, its difficult for the independent learner to use. I found it particularly frustrating that grammatical rules would be given and then the examples to illustrate the rule didn't follow the rule, and the reader was left on their own to figure out why. The vocabulary was purposely kept to minimum; however, the terms were not of much use to the non-business traveler. Perhaps as a review manual this book is useful. To the beginner, not much use 
 This book is remarkable in one way--it accurately represents the fantasies of many a teenage girl.  Yes, Jim really sang to YOU, even encoding special messages in his songs. ("If I WERE to say to you..." in the Ed Sullivan Show is actually a response to Ashcroft's grammar critique, who knew?) Yes, this 20-something man was entralled both intellectually and physically by a nerdy (by her own account) teenager and what he really wanted to do was trade not particularly high brow literary analogies for hours on end.  Yes, you were the only one who truly grasped the meaning of the Doors.  And this goes on for hundreds of pages.  Towards the end, I began to worry seriously about Ashcroft's mental state.   This book adequately represents the fantasy life of the pubescent, but, alas, is no more true than my high school fantasies.  And not only does it have teenager appropriate content, it also has a writing style that could have been lifted verbatim from my overwrought high school diaries.  
 This book is the worst of postmodern popular criticism--well, not the worst. The author is fairly comprehensible, unlike many of his colleagues. However, he is so full of his own cleverness and so enmeshed in a really  tired critical pomo framework that this book becomes incredibly annoying to  read. What a lost opportunity. This could have been a useful analysis of a  cultural phenomenon--buy it for the nice design and photos if you must have  every dinosaur book in print, but don't bother reading it 
 Ray S. Anderson's book, The Shape of Practical Theology: Empowering Ministry with Theological Praxis, was a heart breaking disappointment.  Having high hopes when I first found the title, I was anxious to read the book.  By the end, I was sick at heart at the state of modern theology it portrayed.  Behind the book is a stated premise that there is no such concept as absolute truth.  No passage of Scripture is held to be an absolute commandment, applicable to all peoples in all generations or all cultures.  Everything is relative and subject to redefinition based on the standards of the society in which one lives.  Since Scripture lacks absolute truth, and has no absolute commandments, every passage is subjective in nature, based on how the individual pastor or parishioner feels the Spirit may be leading.  God, being sovereign, may redefine His laws, His words, and His truths in each generation and culture.  Pastors must use culture to determine what action to take based on the suggestive and subjective guidelines of Scripture.  Exegesis is replaced with Praxis as a hermeneutic criterion, and the loose concept of "finding antecedents" becomes the preferred means of interpreting the Word.  In short, this book is a blueprint for the subjective use of God's Word, as is more often seen in the Emerging Church.  This book is simply not about practical theology so much as it is about following one's gut in lieu of not having definitive Scripture on which to rely. 
 he gives plenty of stats and fine details    but forgets that he's talking about people.    it becomes very boring and lifeless, too     much emphasis on details and not enough on    the players behind the numbers. i recommend     " baseball in 41' " by robert creamer, a fine    book  something that "more than merkle..."    should've had more of 
 I bought this book with the hope that it would give inspiration and instructions to create new pieces that include images as well as instructions to embellish existing pieces.  Unfortunately, this book is more focused on how to take Indygo Junction's transfer paper and use it to  embellish pieces.  The patterns to make some of the pieces are conveniently sold by Indygo Junction.  But this is not my major issue with this book.  Given that most of the pieces are created using the same image printing and transfer techniques, there is little reason to have detailed instructions on most of the projects; they use the same transfer techniques for each project, so essentially, you have a book of the same technique being applied to different pieces of clothing! In fact, out of the 40 projects in the book, over half of the projects have you either transfer or print the image onto printable fabric and adhere the image onto the garment.  There are 5 t-shirts that you just adhere images to with only slight embellishment.  I found the projects to be uninspired, even with some very beautiful images involved.  It was a "slap on an image, add a contrasting piece of fabric and some stitching, and you've got art" approach that I found, on a whole, uninspiring.  The projects themselves are a matter of taste--some were nice, others were repetitive (how many t-shirts with appliqued images do you really need to provide detailed instructions for???  One detailed piece, plus a gallery of inspiration would have been better--it would have left room for more project ideas).   To make mattes worse, the instructions are lacking in some of the projects.  For instance, one of the more advanced projects--soldered charms--where the instructions will NOT help a crafter select materials and complete the project.  There is no information on soldering, supplies, techniques, etc.  The assumption is that you'll just figure it out from the soldering iron manufacturer's instructions.  Other projects incorporate unique products, like the Z Becky Brown purses, but the instructions are so simple and provide little inspiration that I wonder why they were included in the first place (the purse instructions simply tell you the sizes are for the panels and instruct you to print out the images from the CD and cut them to fit).    When I first looked at the book, I thought there would be more detail in creating the piece from start to finish; this book is really just a clip art and idea book on how to use the clip art.  For a $30 price tag, I expected much more, and was sorely disappointed.    While the vintage artwork is nice and they make it easy to use (they provide both print versions and images on CD for people with different levels of computer skills--this takes up about 1/2 of the printed pages in the book), the images they supply are for personal use only--you cannot use the images for items you wish to sell commercially (even  for handmade items) unless you're selling the images for a non-profit (e.g. church fund raiser); others will have to license the images from them; that process is unknown, and I'm not sure of the legality of them licensing images they've collected since the images SHOULD be in the public domain for them to collect and publish them.    Overall, I would not recommend this book unless you can get it for a bargain price.  You can look at the cover page and pretty much make up your own piece based upon the cover rather than spending $20 or $30 looking at more of the same inside.  As an alternative, I'd recommend Rice Freeman-Zachery's book, "New Techniques for Wearable Art"--a much more forward thinking, inspirational and creative book 
 You have two choices to believe in.  Two choices, simple, easy.  The choices depend on one variable, though, was there not or was there a resurrection of Jesus Christ.  If there was no resurrection, then there is no eternal hope.  There is no eternal hope for the son who's father is dying of Alzheimer's disease.  There is no eternal hope for the mother who's son died in a war in a far off land.  There is no eternal hope for the woman who has just found out that she has breast cancer.  If there is no resurrection of Christ, then all that we have hoped for, all that we have tried to life for, all the good deeds, all the helping hands, all the care, the love, all of that matters not.  If there is no resurrection of Jesus Christ, then you might as well accept here and now, eat, drink, be merry, because tomorrow you will be dead, and the day after, you will be forgotten.  If you see that the tomb is not empty, and that Easter was not a physical AND spiritual event, then nothing matters.  All there is, in the end, is a cement tomb over your body...if you are that lucky.  If there is a resurrection of Jesus Christ, then there is eternal hope.  That hope means that all our fears, all our worries, and all our concerns will be meet.  No matter what happens around us, there is an eternal perspective that we may...in this life...not understand...but because we can only see with finite eyes (that is, if you believe in the physical resurrection)...then hope DOES spring eternal.  What we see now is only a small, acute, point...that when we are given the eternal eyes... the eyes that we could only have IF and only IF there is a resurrection...will be dealt with.  All questions, all fears, all depression, all tears will be wiped away.    You cannot, and I say this emphatically, you cannot be a Christian if you do not believe in the literal Resurrection of Jesus Christ.  You are only fooling yourself.  A Christian is only a Christian if they accept that the Bible speaks true to you and I when it says that Jesus Christ is the Son of God-born of virgin mother, worked through parables and miracles, died on the cross, and on the third day, rose again through the very power of God Himself.  You are only putting the wool over your eyes by having disbelief.  Even more so, you are mocking and taunting God by saying to God, in effect, like Spong does, that God cannot resurrect the dead...especially if that dead One is His only Begotten Son.  You dare, you completely dare, to say that the Lord God might create the universe...if there is a God, and you seem to think that as there is no Jesus and Resurrection, then there is probably only a "minutely" possibility of there being a God...(there by proving you are not a Christian, you are an Atheist, a Fool, or just plain Blind by your own ego, your own pride, and the powers of darkness)..but this God who might create Galaxies, Black Holes, Tachyon particles, flowers, rainbows, the smiles on children's faces...still cannot resurrect His own Son?    All of human history depends on whether the tomb is empty or not.  All those who have died for the faith...from Stephen and Paul to those who die in foreign lands trying to spread the good news...are meaningless and pointless and should only be laughed at.  I believe, though, that the tomb is empty.  I believe there is hope.  I believe there is reason, and that there is an eternal goodness that I will one day see when I fall asleep.  By knowing full well that there is a resurrection, by knowing that what the Bible says is true, I know that when I go into that good night, I wont be going into night, but a new day.  So what is your choice?  To Believe? or Not to Believe?  That is the question 
 I can't believe how wild, petty, and such a brood Marcus is.  The new earl is such a child in character that I got bored after a hundred pages and threw the book away.  This obviously was not thought out by the author.  This is not a romance,  but a calamity. Boo! Boo! on the author.  This is terrible writing.  I do not recommend this book 
 If you wish to read something for entertainment's sake, then this book will suffice. Written by an English Professor, this book lacks the sort of critical thought those of us in the science deptartments want for. Purportedly an 'Abbreviated History Of Western Manhood,' it is rather an exercise in academic arcana - an attempt to think of something through its opposite or, in this case, its abuse. One is hardly compelled to reconsider ideas about what manhood means. There is nothing in Taylor's "treatise" to support such nonsense as, "This is a specter that has haunted men for centuries: the fear that manhood will become, or has already become, obsolete, superfluous, ridiculous, at best quaint, at worst disgusting." Really? In whose misandrist manifesto? The concept "Western Man" is, after all, just that - a concept. There is no such unified and homogeneous group and no such "specter" has haunted it for so long. That men should cringe at the word castration is less a mystery than than why women should fear rape. In short, Taylor's analysis of the history and purposes of castration sheds less light on the "cultural construct of masculinity" than on the sadistic sexual abuse and humiliation with which males can be threatened and subjugated. That some of his readers find him witty or funny at times is only because Taylor's treatment of his subject is often sophmoric.    In my view, today's attitudes toward manhood and males are best understood in terms of our lacking moral sympathies toward them. Taylor's book is no exception. We are not a generation influenced by Freud so much as by feminism. Thus, the historical abuse and mutilation of women is a subject deadly serious and pertinent to us while the sexual abuse and humiliation of men is treated like something that never happened - that is, something we've misconstured, or, in Tayor's case, given a fictional reinterpretation, mocked and trivalized. Taylor's ignorant belief (not first person, of course) about the sexual prowess of eunuchs is one case in point. Another case in point is Tayor's view that for most of western history castration was a mark of power and divinity and, as the ultimate abrogation of sexual desire, had wide spread currency among Christian metaphysicians. This is nonsense. Taylor is arguing anecdotally to his own foregone conclusions. He wasn't there to take any polls. No doubt, some Christian cults managed to appropriate practices of sexual mutilation already in place - just as Christian nihilism helped to make slavery seem worthy. This did not, however, make such practices any more agreeable as hardly anyone wanted to suffer either condition  themselves. In any case, the spiritualized feelings attained by some Christian monks through self mutilation would have appalled the Greeks - the paragons of western civilization - as it has most men throughout all of human history.   Taylor's book about castration will score a few points for the concept of cultural relativism on a subject that now seems, at best,  uncontroversial or, at worst, comic to the immature. Should he chose to write volumes exploring the gamut of humanity's attitudes regarding every other form of sexual nastiness, he will no doubt find endless tolerance to be feted as well. Would he dare? 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 As a consequence of the proliferation of chick lit, SF authors such as Wilson have caved in and added all the chick lit cliches to the skeleton of a good premise. Delete all the emotional turmoil that the numerous hormonal chicks experience in this otherwise clever book and you're left with a great short story. They should provide a pair of pantyhose created by the "Hypotheticals" with each copy of the book. Maybe they should start calling the award the Huguette Award. Or the "Hug-Me" Award 
 I was rather dissappointed at the content offered and barely impressed at the book's attempt at teaching new skills.  I bought the book for my 5, 7 and 9 year old children and the 9 year-old had already mastered all of the skills offered, the 7 year-old was bored very quickly and only the 5 year old's attention was held any length of time, but his age group lacks the concetration level to hang on for long.  The content was far too simple and barely progressed through the entire book...this book should be marketed to only highly introverted 4-6 year-olds in my opinion, and then it would get only 3 stars... 
 "The Zahir" started out well, but about 100 pages into the book my interest level dropped.  It, in no way, mentally stimulated me.  I could not read one more page of the main character's self-indulgent and arrogant thoughts and actions.  I guess, if you are the type of person that needs to love the main character in order to read a novel, then this is not your book.  I couldn't stand him and I really hope that the main character isn't a reflection Paul Coelho.  I almost threw this book away, but I instead donated it.  I loved "The Alchemist." 
     I picked this book up because I enjoyed Remains of the Day.  The book is, however, arguably the worst book I have ever read.      A slow to non-existent plot drags interminably with page after page of tediously detailed description and converstations that do not advance the story one bit.      I kept wondering if this was a first novel, brought back to life in order to cash in on the author's current celebrity.  It reads like a teenage first try.      Simply dreadful.  Now, I wouldn't touch any other product by this author with a barge pole 
 I wish there was a rating under one star.  I'm supposed to read this for a class, but, in rare fashion, I doubt that I will finish the novel.  I realize this is supposed to be surreal, but must I sacrifice plot and character to immerse myself in "literature"? Maybe I'm a product of the times, but a plot which is at least interesting would be nice, even if I don't care about the characters.  Please: Barth, Barthleme, and Pynchon write complex, surrealistic fiction, but also give us characters we can care about and plots which fascinate 
 I'd like to thank the reader from Los Angeles who completely spoiled this book for me and anyone else who hasn't read it. I was checking to see if this book was good or not, and right away there's some butthead giving away the book's major surprise. Here's a tip, "reader", try giving a spoiler warning before you do something like that again. To do this you can type SPOILERS in capital letters, just like that. It's the courteous thing to do. Also, you probably don't know this, but it's not very nice to tell your friends the ending of a movie that you saw before they did. Kinda spoils the experience 
 This book came highly recommended to me.  With all the hype surrounding its apparent genius I expected to be blown away.  Sadly though, this book comes across as someone who has just played a video game for the first time (MYST) and decided that the kids might be on to something.  Murray proclaims that one day in the distant future, they'll make a 'holodeck' and we'll finally have true immersion.  In the mean time, we can gloss over all the interactive components that make such an experience compelling in the first place.  The future of gaming/narratology/ludology whatever-you-want-to-call-it is already here.  You don't need a "VR Suit" or some imaginary technology to have a truly immersive experience.  Her woefully uninformed look at the games of her day are completely inexcusable:  "...interactors will be lured into worlds where they float, tumble, and arc through thrillingly coloured spaces, fly through imaginary clouds and swim lazily across welcoming mountain ponds.  The nightmare landscape of the fighting maze, in which we feel imperiled may give way to enchanting worlds of increasingly refined visual dealight that are populated by evocative fairy-tale creatures."  At the time of this book's publishing (1997) games such as Jumping Flash, Mario 64, and Tomb Raider had already taken the world by storm. By reducing contemporary gaming to mindless, juvenile violence (while championing those themes in 'War & Peace', 'Hamlet' and 'Star Trek') Murray shows a complete lack of interest and imagination.    The heavy hand of narrative is not the only way to tell a story.  We don't need a "cyberdramatist" the likes of a Dickens or a Shakespeare to show us the way.  She could have explored the work of Miyamoto, Wright or Kojima and the stories that arise out those gaming experiences.  Instead she focuses on the Miller Brothers because they offered up the most conventional form of storytelling.  Eight years on, their impact is almost forgotten.  Above all, people want to act - not in the theatrical sense, but in the name of imaginative 'play'.  Maybe someday she'll prove us all wrong and the "Dr. Quinn Holodeck" will sweep us up in the rapturous joy of existing in a town populated by:   "...blacksmiths, barbers, general store owners, saloon keepers, scouts, and, of course, female doctors and who could be given their own homesteads or boardinghouse rooms in particular physical locations within the fictional world."    Sounds like fun.  Criticism aside, I did enjoy the chapter "Eliza's Daughters".  Murray's look at procedural characters and believable agents proved informative and intriguing.  If only the rest of the book were as objective and plausible then I might actually believe the hype surrounding, "Hamlet on the Holodeck".  
 The can opener... doesn't.  It just turns and turns and hardly goes around the can at all.  I had paid 19.99 for the set and it wasn't worth that 
 I'm a firm believer in freedom of speech, but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities. The product description listed above is completely misleading. It's basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims, and then at the end they slowly torture them to death. Pretty much the worst movie I have ever seen 
 its really too bad the warning about thorsson being a satanist was removed from here. this is information that concerns the material of the book and the tone of the whole thing. i have it confirmed by the group of asatru that asked him to leave, that this is true, and he is also a priest of set. this colors all the books knowlege and is just a relavent to readers as any other information in these reviews 
 This is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature. It is timely but it is not timeless.    Not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly. Not one scene is memorable. The true nature of the book -- soap opera-- is cloaked under its many pages.   Messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story, and she seems to have believed her publicity machine.  I can't believe that her husband, who a great literary critic, would not talk her out of publishing this.  Oh.  I forgot.  Money and fame trumps quality every time. 
 The main virtue of this book is that it presents all of the arguments in favor of an atheist worldview in one place.  The two-star rating reflects the author's clearly disingenuous representation of his knowledge about Christianity. For example: (page 18) "Christianity, therefore, defines ethics in terms of an individual's religious beliefs (which affect no one else) rather than in terms of unselfish conduct toward others." As the author perfectly well knows, this is an absurd and unworthy representation of the Christian view of ethics: Christians take their lead on ethics from Jesus, who could not have described more clearly how we are to behave toward others.  A technique deployed extensively in the book is the use of terms such as "many Christian fundamentalists" and "politically active TV evangelists" not in the restricted sense in which they are relevant, but with the clear inference that the attitudes and behaviors of such minorities are representative of Christians as a whole. The most widely used such expression in the book, however, is "creationists" - a term I have never heard anyone claiming to represent their worldview, but which the author sets up as if it were the mainstream Christian position. Now I don't mean to deny that most Christians believe that God created the universe, but the author extrapolates this in exotic ways: (page 86) "God is now portrayed as more passive in His supervision of Nature - often watching from the sidelines as Nature operates on Her own." (This describes the entirely non-Christian Deist position) (page 70) "Creationists often claim that the laws of physics govern the behavior of the universe" - this is the exact opposite of Christians' belief that God governs the universe and that the "laws of physics" are just a human construct useful for describing natural phenomena. (page 122) "Creationists, however, view scientific debate and disagreement as signs of weakness. Creationism therefore ridicules open-mindedness and scoffs at the free exchange of ideas so essential to a democratic society and to the scientific method itself." - Tell that to the likes of John Polkinghorne, Bill Craig and Roy Varghese, whose books honestly represent opposing views, using science correctly and in its proper context.   The most prevalent approach deployed by atheists (and Mills is no exception) is to use their perception of what God would or would not do in any given situation to argue that no such God exists. (Actually Mills goes one further and suggests how Jesus might better have used the special powers that Mills denies he had!) The problem of pain is perhaps the lowest-hanging fruit for such an approach, and Mills uses it fully in support of his atheist stance. Truly, I understand the problem of reconciling the amount of evil on the world with the idea that there is an entirely good God presiding over us, but the mere fact that it is difficult to do so proves nothing. Mills seems to think that God should somehow intervene to prevent anything that could cause pain or suffering - perhaps even to render people incapable of acting in such a way. Isn't it remarkable that the genre of people (atheists) who more than any other feel that we should be responsible for our own actions are ready to invoke the argument that a good God would intervene at every possible opportunity to deny our free will. I do not pretend to be wise enough to discern God's purposes, but the solutions proposed by Mills (and others) for how God should really act (apart from being utterly arrogant) are self-evidently nonsense.  One of the most popular targets for atheists is what Mills devotes a chapter to under the title "The Myth of Hell". Apparently, Mills can see no possibility of Hell, though he does consider several ideas about why God might create Hell: Deterrence, Separation, and Rehabilitation. Now again, I intend no inference that I suppose to know what God's purpose might be, but it seems that Mills has missed the obvious possibility - which is that Hell is what those who reject God freely choose. After all, wouldn't the Christian idea of heaven, with everyone worshipping God, be "hell" for atheists - so wouldn't they naturally choose a place where materialism is all there is?  I would love to say that I respect the atheist worldview, but I simply do not. If there is no God, there is absolutely no basis on which we can differentiate between good and evil; no moral absolutes; none in fact of the things that atheists rely on to argue their position.    
 ITEM NEVER RECEIVED. IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT BY EMAIL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. MY LAST PURCHASE ON AMAZON  
 Absent of any quality.  Throughly disappointing.  All the Naxos Sherlock series is without ANY redeeming valu 
 This load of tripe reflects 20th century Socialist Marxist doctrine  with such banal comments as "...suburbs have an elitist origin, which exclude the poor..." and "...expensive roads, cars, and the consumption of enormous quantities of gasoline have made possible America's sprawling settlement..."  Clearly, the author fears the present and a future that exposes meddling, bureaucratic central-planning planners as emblematic failures of Progressive Era naive idealism.  Seemingly, the author worships cities, the cesspools of humanity. His work is mere propaganda against what he hates most, persons living closer within Freedom and farther away from Officialdom 
 When yours truly was eleven and in Reading class, "Incident" was required reading.  This had to be the most ridiculous book that I ever had the displeasure of reading. I mean, the boy is cared for by a badger!  Badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind.  I did not believe it at eleven, nor do I now. Also, Eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions.  Was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?  What eleven-year-old wants to read about that? So, for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really didn't want to know about in the first place: this book's for you 
 For a debut album I can say not that bad but still not good. The only song on their that I like is Happy, and that's not even all that great. I think she was blown way out of proportion than how her talent really is.

 A decent record marred by bizarre production choices, "Elevation" is primarily a live album, recorded in September of 1973, with one brief piece from a studio date shortly thereafter.  Pharoah Sanders, heard here on tenor and soprano saxes as well as an array of percussion and vocal is joined on the live tracks by pianist Joe Bonner, bassist Calvin Hill (who doubles on tamboura on a few tracks), percussionists Lawrence Killian, John Blue, Jimmy Hopps and drummer Michael Carvin.  The studio piece ("Greeting to Saud") adds violinist Michael White, inaudible vocalist Sedatrius Brown and percussionist Kenneth Nash with Carvin sitting out.  The four live tracks show remarkable diversity-- opener "Elevation" feels closely related to "A Love Supreme" and "The Creator Has a Masterplan" with Sanders stating a four note theme and providing lovely solos before catching fire and exploding.  The piece begins to cool off a bit when Hill takes a stunning bass solo leading into a staggered theme statement.  But just as the piece starts to cook again, it fades out!  This is a theme that repeats throughout the remainder of the tracks, be it the West-Indian tinged "Ore-Se-Rere" (which truthfully doesn't sit well with me at all-- I find it to a be quite frankly a bit irritating) and lovely soprano-over-drone piece "Spiritual Blessing" (one of the real highlights of the record).  Thankfully spared this editing is the South African-influenced Sander screech-fest "The Gathering" (where again after Sanders brings the piece to a boil simmers with a superb solo from Hill), but the damage is pretty much done-- the editing really ruined the experience for me.  The studio track is interesting enough-- with lovely piano statements over a tamboura drone and a literal wall of percussion before a moody violin enters.  But as one would expect, just as the piece starts to develop, it fades out.  One piece of good news-- sonically it lives up to the usual Impulse! reissues, but I miss the days before GRP/Impulse! was bought by Verve and they used to actually put some effort into reissues-- this is the sort of piece that could have really benefitted from having tracks restored.  Newcomers to Sanders should start with "Karma", it's his best known for a reason, this one is probably for fans only 
 Whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people.  But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day.  The main character (Sid) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in Critical Theory in college (ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining Western Culture to pave the pathway for Marxism).  The film appeals to naive youth 
 Author spends too much time in theory and less time showing real examples.  Author wants you to down load code and spends time discussing bits and pieces of each section.  Very, very, very steep learning curve.  Not a good investment - wish I could find a CSLA book that teaches you step by step... 
 I am very surprised with the rave reviews of this book here. I decided to purchase it for two reasons. First, I trusted the reviews here and decided it would be important to own this book. Second, I am familiar with Douglas Holt's academic work, and have read his articles in academic journals. I thought this book will be very interesting to read.  I am dissapointed mainly because I find that the book does not tell me something original. Instead what Douglas Holt keeps saying in this book is that building an iconic brand is possible by focusing on culture not products. His argument is not convincing, especially when he tries to disprove other forms of brand building: tradition, cultural and emotional. If I have a brand new product, can I still build an icon? Is it advantageous to have an iconic brand? What are the downside of it? These are not talked about in the book.   Another problem is that he keeps repeating the same argument again and again. It gets very boring after a few pages only.   What a disappointment! 
 As many reviewers have commented, Prof. Lopez does an excellent job deconstructing the many fantasies Westerners entertain about Tibet. I was very dismayed, however, by his sneering dismissal of the work of Trungpa Rinpoche and Sogyal Rinpoche, who he declares are not "real Tibetans" because they dared to try to present a difficult terma text in a manner that they believed would resonate with Westerners. While Trunpa Rinpoche did often present the dharma in psychological terms, he consistently affirmed the conventional Tibetan understanding of the six realms and other teachings. Surely Prof. Lopez is aware of the years of vigorous traditional monastic training Rinpoche underwent as a tulku in pre-invasion Tibet, as a result of which he received both the Khenpo degree in religious and mundane studies and the Kyorpon degree in astrology. For Prof. Lopez to think that he is in a position to weigh in on the validity of the teaching choices made by these two lamas strikes me as quite arrogant and presumptuous 
 Public Budgeting Systems by Robert D. Lee, Philip G. Joyce, and Ronald Wayne Johnson is written more clearly... if you have a choice, buy this book.  The problem with Mikesell is that he has to write 200 pages (six chapters) to explain the concept of revenues in the budget process.  Too many trees were wasted in the development of this book.  Lee, Joyce, and Johnson can do this in 40 pages.  The greater majority of my Public Budgeting Systems class at George Mason University feels that the Mikesell book is written in a manner to lull oneself to sleep... the benefit is that one could read the book rather than using drugs to induce sleep.  However, if you are required to purchase the Mikesell book, you should go to the Amazon UK web site and complete your transaction there... you can save yourself about 70 to 80 dollars.    
 "A skepticism towards all meta-narratives" according to... Jacques Derrida, I think...  This is about all the elaboration that is done on the subject of what post-modernism IS.  With regards to what a meta-narrative is, it apparently refers to a fully general philosophical theory, concerning (e.g.) all knowledge-claims; all justificatory strategies; all moral values, rights, and obligations; all instances of injustice;      Apparently this 'theory' differs from nihilism, but if that is what defines it, I don't see how.             If you actually want to learn about post-modernism, this is not a book I could recommend; internet resources have been much more useful.  The section on modern art history and the crisis of expression was interesting, as well as some other random factoids that apparently relate to post-modernism.  On the whole though, I'd say this is a work totally devoid of substance, and and as I learn more I'm inclined to assign the same description to post-modernism itself.  For a similar, comical, and much more scathing review, see the one below entitled "Trash" by 'a reader' 
 I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?  
 Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.    As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.    The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.    
 The language in this "novel" is so pretentious and convoluted as to be largely unreadable by the average reader. It seems that James never met a comma he didn't like, and uses them to imbed all sorts or modifiers and asides. Although the graduate students may attach some deeper meaning to this, I suspect he really didn't have a clear idea of anything he wanted to say so he simply rambled on. At least with Faulkner there is a payoff. With James, all the language covolutions lead to nothing in the way of action. Random House must have had a large,unsold inventory of this book ( not surprising) so they included it in their top 100 list. James has single-handedly ruined my project of reading the all of the top 100. I will not, cannot, albeit I would like to, read,with any pleasure, the other two James books, novels perhaps, on the list, the Random House list that is 
 there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was "well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future" it was too focused on that ...I liked "Stranger In a Strange Land" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page. 
 The picture of this curtain makes it look thicker than it really is (by a long shot).  It does not "screen out unwanted pests, birds and harsh sunlight". Well, maybe birds, but certainly not bugs or light. There are large gaps between each strand of beads and it's completely see through.  This is not what you are looking for if you want a little privacy.  On a positive note, Amazon made the return very easy 
 I started this novel with high hopes....expecting something better  than some self proclaimed thrillers I had recently inflicted myself with, but it was not to be.The plot is simplistic and the protagonist blunders from one accident to another.He only manages to succeed in the end due to an unbeliveable set of good luck and stupidity on part of the villians.  While reading the novel there was a strong sense of deja vu .... of having been there and done that, especially with respect to the character of Dr Hemlock.There is very little that is original or likable about him.  In my opinion Ian Fleming wrote infinitely better novels of this genre, viz. spy thrillers, I have yet to come across any author with a better command over language and creator of more interesting characters than him.  My search continues..... 
 Can't add much to the discussion about the movie, but wanted to say that this DVD listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of School Daze. It says it has both full screen and widescreen, but it doesnt 
 I was so disappointed with this book, and am surprised at the number of fabulous reviews it received.  Every page demanded that I revel in my "feminist roots."  For any would-be stay at home moms interested in supporting their husbands by keeping house, fixing dinner, and doing laundry in addition to taking care of the kids--this is not the book for you.  It encourages you to not "give in" to the stereotypes and does not acknowledge that there may in fact be jobs just for dads and jobs just for moms.  I know this is not a popular view, maybe I'm the only one around who thinks this.  Your husband, however, may not be overjoyed if you take this book to heart!!!  Also, for any mothers seeking a more spiritual path to staying at home, this book advocated TOTAL CONTROL by you in your decisions--really letting your own self-interests direct your routine instead of those around you or giving up those self-interests in pursuit of a higher calling.  Even though I consider myself to be a feminist in many ways, this book was TOO MUCH 
 Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish  until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly 
 Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot.  Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series.  As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.  It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all.  I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.  There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.  I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one 
 This is yet another example of the chicanery and pseudoscientific nonsense that people use to fleece the desperate and ill of their hard earned money. It sickens me that people like this offer false hope in order to turn a buck.  Gee, this hasn't been done by mainstream medicine in over 50 years the author points out.  Go figure, that's because it doesn't work.  Last time I checked, sitting in a tanning booth was more likely to cause cancer than cure it, and in a very pseudoscientific way, that's what the author's telling you to do.  As usual, this "enlightened healer" is only trying to help people by pointing out things that those evil doctors don't want you to know, because by golly, light therapy isn't profitable for them.  So... plunk your money here! because writing this drivel has been VERY profitable for Mr. Douglas.    Also, for the record, you can get anybody to testify that "XYZ worked for me, it cured my herpes!" or whatever  you want them to spout, and you can prove anything with an underpowered "randomized controlled clinical trial".  You run the same trial 20 times with 10 patients, you'll eventually get the results you want to see.  Then you find a "journal" of bogus medicine to publish it, and voila.  You can reference anything.  Unfortunately, most people reading these books have an incomplete (at best) understanding of the science and statistics involved in these "trials" (and to be fair, the drug company trials as well, but that's a rant for another day).  This is commercialism, pure and simple, and if it makes you feel better, then by all means go play with lightbulbs, but if you think it's going to cure you of anything, then you're going to be profoundly disappointed 
 So awful that if I could have given it a half star I would have--and even  that would have been overly generous. The heroine is a cop and a woman and seems to be totally stupid as both.Her lover -- someone investigating a case for which she's currently under suspension for--makes a pass at her virtually from their first meeting and she almost encourages his attention. She falls into bed with him at the first opportunity even though he has major questions about her innocence. The plotline is idiotic and predictable -- I knew who done it almost from chapter one. This wasn't worth the money it cost or the time it took to download it. Don't bother. This is a total embarrassment and gives books about interracial romance a really bad name 
 The book seems to ramble back and forth in time and little is tied down. People are listed (Calabi & Yao - Yang & Mills and so on) But I have no idea of what they really added to SMT. No equations are given. It theories failed, IO have no idea why 
 It's sad what has happened to some of the kids who were victims of no medical treatment when they need it. I'm christian so I pray when someone I knows sick so I'm not totally knocking that Christian Scientist belive in healing . The real problem is their view on Christ. Mabye they should read Christ's words in the Bible instead of letting they're interpritation governed by Marry Baker Eddy. Who stole the idea from Professor Quimbly then claimed to have a revelation. It truly upsets me how many lives her lies have ruined. 
 This is just a REALLY bad book.  First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor.  What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?    The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains.  Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable.  Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever.  Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains.  This is supposed to be one of those "the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).  I could go on and on but it's not worth the words.  This book is REALLY a waste of time.  I can't believe anybody published it 
 such a waste. read Jesus' Son instead--it's amazing. this...is...the dullest thing i have ever read. my book club hates me for it. they will all get Jesus' Son for xmas 
 ...SI's first album was sheer beginners' luck ? It made me wonder. Whilst I found Dicknity somewhat charming,and mildly entertaining (i'd give it 3 out of 5 stars), their new effort lacks all that I hoped it to be. After many listening sessions, I still don't connect with it and, quite frankly, find myself skipping all the songs a few seconds after they begin 
 But every other song is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. Like That is great though...too bad they had to sell out so badly, they were going places 
 The write-up on this SoftHeat Plus heating pad makes no mention of a "New" feature that automatically shuts the pad off after 1 hour.  I specifically wanted one that did NOT have an auto-shutoff timer.  Damn!  Back it goes.  
 I am so disappointed. I thought this book was going to teach me to improvise characters using Nintendo's style, not just teaching me to draw a few of their characters...now I have to actually think to get their style down right = 
 What happened??! I have really been enjoying the Sneaky Pie Brown series - up till now. Found this one to be extremely disappointing and far off the mark for all the characters- they weren't very likeable. Conversations were too preachy and had little or nothing to do with the basic story line. There was very little focus leading up to how the mystery was solved, and  the condition in which the murder victim(s) were found, more graphic than it needed to be.  Ms Brown needs to go back and review her earlier books in this series and refresh her memory on why this series has been so fun to read. Jud 
 This book is helpful to have on the bookshelf for anyone looking for new ideas. I did not find that it really treated its subject in any depth. 
 As much as I would like to recommend this movie, I have to admit it is not one of the best movies of Jesus life. It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word, which is, at times, a useful tool.  That said, the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.  If you what the best Jesus movie ever done, nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.  The two other parts to this series, Acts and John, are done very well. 
 Written by the same author as Cults, New Religions Movements, and Your Family, as well as Defending the Faith: A Beginner's Guide to Cults and New Religions, gives a sense where the author is headed with this prodigious "history" of the Church.  Although not an actual history of Mormonism, but more of a superficially selective journalistic survey of the Church, (its people, dealings and influences) the book offers the reader an enormous panoramic overview at the entire 170 year span of its existence.  Yes, the volume is anti-Mormon, it is negative and has no balanced view or viewpoint.  Abanes uses enflamed and sensualistic language from the start and propagates the same misjudgments as previous anti-Mormon writers (confusing the action of members with the doctrines of the institution, using enflamed and unreliable anti-Mormon sources as well as regurgitating old anti-Mormon arguments that have been dealt-with in scholarly journals and balanced histories) yes, he mostly uses only secondary materials and relies on the Tanner's as an authoritative source, and yes, the author has no clue what historical perspective is, but, one must give the author his due for the broad scope of the work.  He not only covers all the standard anti-Mormon fare (the Danites, blood atonement, polygamy, money digging, etc.); but current subjects as well (including the Osmond's, Steve Benson, the 2002 Olympics, Paul Dunn, Thomas Ferguson, and racism). I enjoyed the author's journalistic and creative approach to chapter and sub-chapter headings as well (i.e., "Bloody Brigham," "Big Trouble in Little Missouri," "Pride and Prejudice" and "Thinking is a Sin").  I like that Abanes uses the internet and listed URL's for reference and resource, I liked his use of charts (First Vision, Book of Mormon, failed prophecies), and even though this book would not be published by an academic press or a large well-known publisher, it was published by a distinguished independent publisher that was since bought by the Avalon Publishing Group.  Although the work cannot be recommend as a studious publication or an important work on Mormonism, the author does show that the Church as an institution does have a long way to go in answering questions about its past, its "official" vs. its "actual" history, and currently about its political activities, treatment of its "academic" members (versus the coddling it shows towards its more notable members (including general authorities) as well as its suppression of its own history that includes the closing-off of its records and library.  The volume has 436 pages of text, five appendices (one containing a helpful glossary of "Mormon terms"), 152 pages of notes, a small bibliography and a 22 page index 
 I bought an even nicer version than this one for $120 at a store. I bought the Copper-T and had 2 stop working on me in the span of 7 months. The first only lasted 2.5 months. The third one I got through the warranty was not put together correctly and ripped out my hair. The warranty only lasts a year and the product will surely break down before then. I was told I could not have a refund because "the store I bought it from is the company that took my money." I have never been so frustrated with a company 
 My daughter asked for this movie and I agree with most of the children's reviews. The movie was not entertaining and too mature for its intended audience. And last but certainly not least, why are there no other races represented in the my scence crew?! No wonder your sales of barbie and crew are down. Matel needs to wake up! I am now a faithful BRATZ customer because they make a point to include more than one race in all of their dolls and movies. And the bratz movie is better 
 Did I miss something?  Clearly from the title alone Dr. Sarno believes tension and tightening of muscles is the cause of most back/leg pain.  Where is the chapter that gives you steps to change this?!  I didn't need to buy this book 
 This refers to the audio version of the book - I almost felt as though a ghost writter had written what I was hearing.  The narrator was not at all as good as Cherry Jones and for some strange reason Diane has resorted to some less than nice language that was not in the earlier books (that I have read and I have not read them all).  Too bad - this just doesn't rise to the level of her other books - a big disappointment 
 This is called a book, but written in the form of a blog.  I was reading Fidel and instead of facts about the dictator or his rule, I was bombarded with a rant about the evil of the left and hollywood in America.  Instead of true history this is a partisan rant 
 I am quite disappointed with this book, considering my pediatrician's office recommends it! The recipes are unhealthy -most using honey and canned foods. The chapter devoted to making baby's first foods is not informative or helpful. A better choice is Mommy Made, which includes a guide on when to introduce foods & how to prepare them. If you're looking for a nutritional-how-to, Feed Me is NOT the way to go 
 After seeing this I wanted to snatch my eyeball out of the sockett it was so stupid. I thought Angela Bettis was through torturing us after her horrible remake of "Carrie", but I guess not. If you're lonely, buy a dog, or try keeping a boyfriend and not scaring him off, but, by no means, do you begin to start killing people off and sewing their body parts together to make you a friend. This chick was seriously messed up. At any rate, I see all the rave reviews, and I don't understand it, but I guess I don't share the morbid imaginations. Afterall, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be a cult classic. I just didn't like it though 
 This pump was refered to me by the hospital where I had my first son.  So since I got it and used it.  My breast hurt worse using this pump then when I was engorged.  It was one of the worst experiances.  I was under the impression that this was suppose to help with day to day with a new baby.  I connot recommend enough to NOT use this one.  I am know expecting again and looking for a pump.  I know that I will not go by hospital recommendation again 
 It is a shame that American film classics ( like L and H)  get more attention and love outside of the US than in it. I just bought the Universal Laurel and Hardy 21 Volume Box set which is only available in Europe from Amazon UK (region 2). This set is EVERYTHING people are saying it is. It is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films ( some solo efferts) and goes though the Hal Roach Features. All the prints are restored and of pristine quality. A truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys. There are some missing films ( I assume for copyright reasons) such as Babes in Toyland, The Devils Brother, Bonnie Scotland and Flying Deuces.   To acomadate these DVDs I bought a region free DVD player off Amazon,which is the only way to go if you really want to collect. The DVD player was very cheap. plays beautfully and  is well worth the investment. As a side note if you have a region free player all the DVDs in the Universal Box set are also availble as single dics, in case you don't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films. If you love Laurel and Hardy this is the only way to go! Anything to screw Hallmark and the corperate monster!! Why did they buy these great films just to sit on them and distribute half-A prints!!!  
 If you want to understand something about movies, read the classic texts on which some of the great directors formed themselves: Ejzenstein, Pudovkin, Bazin, Arnheim and stick to them. In this book which I couldn't read but for a third, you find essays on many aspects of film viewing and making which, in the best of cases, any film fan already grabs intuitively, without so much wordage being spent on them; others that are just an endless exercise in rehashing liminar theories set forth by other obscure "students" for the twenty people who care to read them; others try to reach conclusions on themes which are just waiting for some other academic theorist to reformulate them and that, being generally based on psychoanalisis, are generally undemonstrable. 
 I tried to read this book.  I really tried.  I got it on sale because I'd heard of the author and was curious.  This is the first book in my memory that I have put aside because I hated every sentence in it.  Normally I struggle through the first part of a "boring" book and become pleasantly surprised by the end.  I just couldn't get past the first fifty pages, and not without lack of effort.  The sad part is that I wanted to like this book and made an honest effort to, but the author made that impossible for me.  My advice is don't read this one - there are better books out there.  Who knows, in a few years I may even be willing to try one of Eco's earlier works.  Then again, I hate this book so much that I doubt I'll even be willing to concede to that.  If you like "historical" fiction, try Carter Beats the Devil or the Venus Throw, which are a lot more fun to read 
 By 1968 Julie Andrews was one of the most-loved performers of stage and screen, the original Eliza Doolittle of Broadway's MY FAIR LADY, a Best Actress Oscar winner for MARY POPPINS, and the star of film version of THE SOUND OF MUSIC--a movie that was so profitable Hollywood wags dubbed it "The Sound of Money."  20th Century Fox wasted little time in developing a new property for their new star, and (possibly under the influence of FUNNY GIRL, the great stage success that was set to film at about the same time) reached back in time to tell the story of a theatrical legend: Gertrude Lawrence.  It seemed like a winner.  Gertrude Lawrence (1902-1952) was known as "The Toast of Two Continents" in an era when the term had an almost literal meaning, and the highs and lows of her extremely public private life were almost as dramatic as her career. Operating with an incredibly large budget and under the direction of Robert Wise, the bio-pic STAR! seemed to have everything: lavish sets, incredible costumes, a truly great collection of songs, an epic running time, and--of course--Julie Andrews.  What more could you want?  Well, an interesting movie would be nice.  STAR! opened with tremendous fanfare in 1968 and proved an instant fiasco.  All the earnings of THE SOUND OF MUSIC were wiped out seemingly overnight, and with bankruptcy staring it in the face 20th Century Fox cut the film from three to two hours and rushed the film into general release as THOSE WERE THE HAPPY DAYS.  As a result, the film holds the dubious distinction of being the only major Hollywood film to completely tank twice in major theatrical release.  At the time, much of the film's failure was laid at the feet of Julie Andrews.  Gertrude Lawrence, her remarkable career, and her high-flying lifestyle were still well-recalled in 1968, and Julie Andrews simply did not look, walk, talk, sing, or in any way, shape or form bear any resemblance to her.  Seen today, however, this seems an unfair accusation; it is very evident that the project was never intended as a recreation of Lawrence, and Julie Andrews is actually quite good within the very tight limitations imposed upon her.  The real problem is the script, which goes nowhere at a slow crawl.  Indeed, the single most dramatic event in the entire story is Lawrence's financial bankruptcy!  Yes, you can enjoy the sights and sounds of STAR!  But the story is beyond boring: it makes you feel that you're sinking slowly to the bottom of a sea of Jello.  The DVD has been criticized for leaving out the few minutes of intermission material that accompanied the original release; frankly, I can't see this as anything more than a mercy, for the less time spent here the better.  As for the bonuses, they are okay--which is to say that they are actually more interesting than the film itself.  I'll be generous and give it two stars for production values and musical numbers.  But unless you are a diehard Julie Andrews fan, do yourself a favor and give STAR! a miss.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
 These socks were thin, large, and horrible.  They had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently.  Absolutely worthless 
 Though I don't agree with some other reviewers who believe that narrators or main characters need to have redeeming qualities to be interesting or engaging (read the short story "Rock Springs" by Richard Ford), I found Chippering to be just plain annoying. His voice was too silly to keep reading for 384 pages. Maybe it's funny the first time he tells us something that obviously isn't true, but after 300 references to how attractive he is to women when the women he's with clearly despise him, the story gets to be a bit trite. Had this book been a little shorter, maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. I don't know, though, because I never got to the end - and I'm usually the kind that can't leave a book unfinished.  The most interesting part of the story is one which is left almost completely untouched. I kept wanting to read more about Chippering's betrayal of his Green Beret buddies and what they were going to do to him, but after 280 pages of the same nonsense with Lorna Sue and Mrs. Robert Kooshof, I gave up. Okay, maybe Tim O'Brien has been type-cast as a Vietnam writer - but really his best work revolves around the war. Hopefully (ha ha) he can break out of this label, but if he keeps writing GOOD fiction about the war instead of this garbage, I'll be happy 
 Not sure if this disk delivers anything such albums as noisette or backwards don't from the standpoint of music, but the recording quality is pretty bad by my standards.  I read that the voiceprint soft machine recordings are pretty crabby, so I always steered clear from them. However, I also read somewhere that this one is better than most, so I decided to give it a chance. I couldn't really sit thru the whole thing...and just to let the reader understand where I am coming from - I do have realistic expectations from never before released live archives from 30-something years ago. For example "live in paris" , while  mono and not  top notch quality, is quite enjoyable in my opinion.  Had I known what I was getting, I would never have paid $23 for this CD. Noisette is much better and it is cheaper as well. To say even more, for some reason voiceprint cd's tend to generally be more expensive than those from cuneiform. I wonder why.  That said, I certainly recommend this disk to those who are desperate to hear a different variation of noisette 
 Gray is so far off the target when it comes to nutrition and exercise.He says women might gain weight from exercise? Didn't he ever hear about if you burn more calories than you take in you'll lose weight? Simple math Gray!Everything about this book smacks of sell,sell,sell! snail oil salesmanship.When will he  realize people have different needs bssed on individuality rather than gender.No one has any business making the blanket statements he makes,it's irresponsible. Another very corny statement is women get good brain chemistry from affection and cuddling,while men get good brain chemistry from sex.How much longer is society going to promote these  myths? Bad advice,irresposible and plain corny 
 Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying 
 I, too, wish I had read more reviews before buying the set. Although the interview with Loggia was great (I remember him fondly as ex-cat burglar Thomas Hewitt Everett Cat from the old one-season 'T.H.E. Cat' series that played at 9:30 on NBC Fridays long ago...I think U.N.C.L.E. was playing afterwards, but I could be wrong about that...it might have been the season Star Trek played at 10), the number of episodes of the two shows was VERY disappointing.  If Disney can give us an entire 17 hours of Spin and Marty, what's with three episodes each of these two? This is not a good value for $35. Most full seasons of 25 episodes of most TV shows are in this same price range.  Don't forget, Disney, you're talking TV shows here...ones that you're rerun on your own channels. (Unfortunately, when I didn't have access to the network.) Asking $35 for six episodes is VERY steep.  I wouldn't buy another set if they issued another with more episodes. Too pricy.  bo 
 The sheets and comforter in this set are very scratchy and stiff and you can see right through the sheets.  I would not recommend the set, very poor quality.  I don't even use the sheets on my son's bed because they seem so uncomfortable 
 This play attempts to make the audience think about the meaning of art and life, but in the end one feels that certain characters are simply cold and that the point is lost in a silly dynamic.  Rather than use a more subtle method, the play's major themes are quite literally speeled out near the end.  Rather than allow for self-examination or reflection, the audience instead is boxed into one of a few simplisitic mindsets.  It would have been better if the play asked the same quesions in a less cheesy, final reveal format and instead tried to analyze the real inner-workings of human interaction, relationships, and friendships.  Rather than being deep, it comes off as trite and maudlin.  Topped with awkward dialouge, this play is neither entertaining nor intelecutally stimulating 
 We used this book about four years ago and found it very helpful in providing the basic information about schools for our oldest son.  So, when our youngest started pondering the college choice, we ordered this edition thinking it would again be helpful.  Were we wrong!!  This edition is very unreliable.  I am sure that Stanford would be pleased to know that although the class of 2009 had 20,195 applicants with only 2,426 admissions, their selectivity rating is 89!  And with a freshman class of 1,633 they have a total undergraduate enrollment of 1,858.  This is an obvious error, but how many of the other schools, maybe not as well known, have been misrepresented by this guide?  Princeton Review needs to send us a refund 
 This isn't a kids book at all. The message behind it is one of choice, making reference to a woman's right to choose through horton and the planet. I don't care what your views on abortion are (anti or pro), you shouldn't let young children read and decyfer the hidden meaning. Dr. Seuss was a nut job and a child corrupter, don't support his work.  
 This was a cute locket but far too small to put any sort of a photo in it . The only use it would serve would be a charm never to be opened. Not worth the price
